A '''zero-emission vehicle''' ('''ZEV''') is a [[vehicle]] that does not emit [[motor vehicle emissions|exhaust gas]] or other pollutants from the onboard source of power.<ref name="CARB01">{{Cite web|url=http://www.arb.ca.gov/html/gloss.htm#Z|title=Glossary of Air Pollution Terms: ZEV|author=[[California Air Resources Board]]|date=2009-03-09|access-date=2009-04-21|archive-date=2009-04-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090420012724/http://www.arb.ca.gov/html/gloss.htm#Z|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="AboutZEV">{{Cite web|url=http://alternativefuels.about.com/od/glossary/g/ZEV.htm|title=What is a ZEV - Zero Emissions Vehicle?|author=Christine & Scott Gable|work=About.com Autos |publisher=About.com: Hybrid Carts & Alt Fuels|access-date=2008-04-21|archive-date=2011-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111025073309/http://alternativefuels.about.com/od/glossary/g/ZEV.htm|url-status=live}}</ref> The California definition also adds that this includes under any and all possible operational modes and conditions. This is because under cold-start conditions for example, [[internal combustion engine]]s tend to produce the maximum amount of pollutants.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Zero-Emission Vehicles {{!}} Caltrans|url=https://dot.ca.gov/programs/sustainability/zero-emission-vehicles|access-date=2021-08-25|website=dot.ca.gov|language=en|archive-date=2021-08-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210825180755/https://dot.ca.gov/programs/sustainability/zero-emission-vehicles|url-status=live}}</ref> In a number of countries and states, transport is cited as the main source of [[greenhouse gas]]es (GHG) and other pollutants. The desire to reduce this is thus politically strong.

==Terminology==
Harmful pollutants to the health and the environment include [[particulates]] ([[soot]]), [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[carbon monoxide]], [[ozone]], [[lead]], and various [[NOx|oxides of nitrogen]]. Although not considered emission pollutants by the original [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) or [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) definitions, the most recent common use of the term also includes [[volatile organic compound]]s, several toxic airborne compounds (such as [[1,3-Butadiene]]), and pollutants of global significance such as [[carbon dioxide]] and other [[greenhouse gas]]es.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/emissions_pollutants.html|title=Alternative & Advanced Vehicles: Pollutants and Health|author=Alternative Fuels and Advanced Vehicles Data Center|publisher=Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, [[US DOE]]|access-date=2009-04-21|archive-date=2012-05-03|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503231120/http://www.afdc.energy.gov/afdc/vehicles/emissions_pollutants.html|url-status=live}}</ref>

Examples of zero-emission vehicle with different power sources can include [[human-powered transport|muscle-powered]] vehicles such as [[bicycle]]s, [[electric bicycle]]s, and [[gravity racer]]s.

===Motor vehicles===
Also other [[battery electric vehicle]]s, which may shift emissions to the location where the electricity is generated (if the electricity comes from coal or natural gas power plants—as opposed to hydro-electric, [[wind power]], [[solar power]] or nuclear power plants);<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/coal/map/|title=Existing Coal Map - Beyond Coal - Sierra Club|access-date=30 May 2015|archive-date=2 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602231354/http://www.sierraclub.org/coal/map/|url-status=live}}</ref> and [[fuel cell]] [[hydrogen vehicle|vehicles powered by hydrogen]], which may shift emissions to the location where the hydrogen is generated. It does not include [[hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle]]s because these do generate some emissions (although [[Hydrogen internal combustion engine vehicle#Near zero emissions|being near-emissionless]]). It also does not include [[Alternative fuel vehicle|vehicles running on 100% biofuel]] as these also emit exhaust gases, despite being carbon neutral overall.

[[Life cycle assessment|Emissions from the manufacturing process]] are thus not included in this definition, and it has been argued that the emissions that are created during manufacture are currently of an order of magnitude that is comparable to the emissions that are created during a vehicle's operating lifetime.<ref name="guardian.co.uk">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/sep/23/carbon-footprint-new-car|title=Manufacturing a car creates as much carbon as driving it|author=Mike Berners-Lee|work=the Guardian|date=23 September 2010|access-date=30 May 2015|archive-date=25 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150425060248/http://www.theguardian.com/environment/green-living-blog/2010/sep/23/carbon-footprint-new-car|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="environmentalresearchweb.org">{{cite web|url=http://environmentalresearchweb.org/cws/article/news/39408|title=Calculating the real carbon footprint of vehicles|access-date=30 May 2015|archive-date=31 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531001336/http://environmentalresearchweb.org/cws/article/news/39408|url-status=live}}</ref>

However, these vehicles are in the early stages of their development; the manufacturing emissions may decrease by the development of technology, industry, shifting toward mass production and the ever-increasing use of [[renewable energy]] throughout the supply-chains.

==History==
[[File:MHV Reva Electric 02.jpg|thumb|right|The Indian [[REVAi|REVA]] [[electric car]] is a zero emissions vehicle (ZEV).]]
[[File:FCX Clarity.jpg|thumb|The [[Honda FCX Clarity]], launched in 2008, is a [[fuel cell]] [[hydrogen vehicle]] compliant with the ZEV standard and sold in [[Japan]] and in the U.S. (only in [[Los Angeles]]).]]

===Well-to-wheel emissions===
The term zero-emissions or ZEV, as originally coined by the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB), refers only to [[Exhaust gas|motor vehicle emissions]] from the onboard source of power. Therefore, CARB's definition is accounting only for pollutants emitted at the point of the vehicle operation, and the clean air benefits are usually local because depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the electricity generation plants.<ref name=TwoBillion>{{Cite book | last = [[Daniel Sperling|Sperling, Daniel]] and Deborah Gordon | title = Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability | year = 2009 | pages = [https://archive.org/details/twobillioncarsdr00sper_0/page/22 22 to 26] | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]], New York | isbn = 978-0-19-537664-7 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/twobillioncarsdr00sper_0/page/22 }}</ref> In a broader perspective, the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as [[wind power|wind]], [[solar energy|solar]], [[hydroelectric]], or [[nuclear power]] for ZEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions.<ref name="TwoBillion" /><ref name="PEVs">{{Cite book|title=Plug-In Electric Vehicles: What Role for Washington?|editor=[[David B.

However, the spread of electrical-powered vehicles can help the development of systems for charging the EV batteries from excess electricity which cannot be used otherwise. For instance, electricity demand is lowest at night and the excess generated electricity at this time can be used for recharging the EVs' batteries. It's worth mentioning that renewable sources such as wind turbines or solar panels are less controllable in terms of the amount of generated electricity compared to fossil fuel power plants; most renewable energy sources are [[intermittent energy source]]s. Therefore, development of these resources will lead to excess energy which can be better used by development of EVs.<ref>Lopes, JA Peças, PM Rocha Almeida, and F. J. Soares. "Using vehicle-to-grid to maximize the integration of intermittent renewable energy resources in islanded electric grids."&nbsp;''Clean Electrical Power, 2009 International Conference on''. IEEE, 2009.</ref> Moreover, most EVs can benefit from [[regenerative brake]]s and other optimization systems which increases the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] in these vehicles.

[[Fuel cell vehicle]]s (FCVs) can help even more in terms of the development of sustainable energy sources because these cars use hydrogen as their fuel. Compressed hydrogen can be used as an energy storage element, while electricity  must be stored in batteries. The hydrogen can be produced by electricity through [[Electrolysis of water|electrolysis]], and this electricity can come from green sources. Hydrogen can be produced in situ, e.g. excess at wind farm when the generated electricity is not needed, or it can be connected to the grid to use the excess electricity from the grid and produce electricity, e.g. at hydrogen pump stations. As a result, development of FCVs can be a big step toward sustainable development and reducing GHG emission in a long-term perspective.<ref>Barton, John P., and David G. Infield. "Energy storage and its use with intermittent renewable energy."&nbsp;''IEEE transactions on energy conversion''&nbsp;19.2 (2004): 441-448.</ref>

Other countries have a different definition of ZEV, noteworthy the more recent inclusion of [[greenhouse gas]]es, as many European rules now regulate CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. CARB's role in regulating greenhouse gases began in 2004 based on the 2002 [[Fran Pavley#Environmental legislation|Pavley Act (AB 1493)]], but was blocked by lawsuits and by the EPA in 2007, by rejecting the required waiver. Additional responsibilities were granted to CARB by California's [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006]] (AB 32), which includes the mandate to set [[low-carbon fuel standard]]s.<ref name=TwoBillion/>

As a result of an investigation into false advertising regarding "zero-emissions" claims, the [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|Advertising Standards Authority]] (ASA) in the UK ruled in March 2010 to ban an advertisement from Renault UK regarding its "zero-emission vehicles" because the ad breached CAP (Broadcast) TV Code rules 5.1.1, 5.1.2 (Misleading advertising) and 5.2.1 (Misleading advertising- Evidence) and 5.2.6 (Misleading advertising-Environmental claims.)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.asa.org.uk/Complaints-and-ASA-action/Adjudications/2010/3/Renault-UK-Ltd/TF_ADJ_48291.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405023303/http://www.asa.org.uk/Complaints-and-ASA-action/Adjudications/2010/3/Renault-UK-Ltd/TF_ADJ_48291.aspx|url-status=dead|title=ASA Adjudication on Renault UK Ltd|archivedate=April 5, 2010}}</ref>

Greenhouse gases and other pollutant emissions are generated by vehicle manufacturing processes. The emissions from manufacturing are many factors larger than the emissions from tailpipes, even in gasoline engine vehicles. Most reports on ZEVs' impact to the climate do not take into account these manufacturing emissions,<ref name="guardian.co.uk"/><ref name="environmentalresearchweb.org"/> though over the lifetime of the car the emissions from manufacturing are relatively small.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/does-hybrid-car-production-waste-offset-hybrid-benefits.htm|title=Does hybrid car production waste offset hybrid benefits?|date=6 December 2010|website=howstuffworks.com|access-date=27 May 2017|archive-date=17 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170517094312/http://science.howstuffworks.com/science-vs-myth/everyday-myths/does-hybrid-car-production-waste-offset-hybrid-benefits.htm|url-status=live}}</ref>

Apart from [[animal-powered vehicle|animal-powered]] and [[human-powered vehicle]]s, [[battery electric vehicle]]s (which include [[battery electric vehicle|cars]], [[electric airplane|aircraft]] and boats) also do not emit any of the above pollutants, nor any {{CO2}} gases during use. This is a particularly important quality in densely populated areas, where the [[health]] of residents can be severely affected. However, the production of the fuels that power ZEVs, such as the production of [[hydrogen]] from [[fossil fuel]]s, may produce more emissions per mile than the emissions produced from a conventional fossil fueled vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-03/miot-msh031003.php|title=MIT study: Hydrogen car no environmental panacea|date=10 March 2003|work=EurekAlert!|access-date=30 May 2015|archive-date=30 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530211539/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-03/miot-msh031003.php|url-status=live}}</ref> A [[well-to-wheel]] [[life cycle assessment]] is necessary to understand the emissions implications associated with operating a ZEV.

===Subsidies for public transport===
Japanese [[public transport]] is being driven in the direction of zero emissions due to growing environmental concern. Honda has launched a conceptual bus which features exercise machines to the rear of the vehicle to generate [[kinetic energy]] used for propulsion.

Due to the stop-start nature of idling in public transport, [[regenerative braking]] may be a possibility for public transport systems of the future.

===Subsidies for development of electric cars===
In an attempt to curb carbon [[air pollution|emissions]] as well as [[noise pollution]] in [[South Africa|South African cities]], the South African Department of Science & Technology (DST), as well as other private investments, have made US$5 million available through the [[Innovation Fund]] for the development of the Joule. The [[Optimal Energy Joule|Joule]] is a five-seater car, planned to be released in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.optimalenergy.co.za|title=Environmental Topics & Sustainable Development|access-date=30 May 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305040118/http://optimalenergy.co.za/|archive-date=5 March 2016}}</ref> However the company ceased trading in 2012.

===Low and zero emission zones===
Several cities have implemented [[low-emission zone]]s. Launched in 2019 and set to expand in 2023, the implementation of London's [[Ultra Low Emission Zone]] (ULEZ) incentivizes and accelerates the widespread adoption of cleaner vehicles through setting daily charge rates for driving vehicles that are non-compliant with ULEZ emission standards.<ref name="Mayor of London">{{cite report |author1=Mayor of London |title=Inner London Ultra Low Emission Zone Expansion One Year Report |date=10 February 2023 |pages=10, 27 |url=https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/2023-02/Inner%20London%20ULEZ%20One%20Year%20Report%20-%20final.pdf |access-date=26 April 2023}}</ref> Oxford was the first city in Britain [[Oxford ZEZ|to introduce a zero emission zone]] in February 2022 where electric vehicles can enter free of charge while other vehicles can pay up to £10 to drive in the zone between 07:00 and 19:00.<ref>[https://cherwell.org/2024/02/07/oxfordshire-county-council-to-decide-on-expansion-of-zero-emission-zone/ Oxfordshire County Council to decide on expansion of Zero Emission Zone]</ref>

=== Phasing out fossil fuel vehicles ===
Aside from direct incentives towards zero emission vehicles, governments also introduce measures to [[Phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles|phase out fossil fuel vehicles]]. This leaves zero emission vehicles as the main vehicle option available.
