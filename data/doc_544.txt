Throughout its production, it was available in two-door coupe, four-door sedan, five-door hatchback variants. It was not sold in Europe , which got the similarly sized Kia Ceed (except for Russia and Ukraine , where the Ceed and the Forte were sold together). In some markets, such as Korea, Australia and Brazil, the Forte is marketed as Kia Cerato , replacing its predecessor of the same name. In Colombia and Singapore, the name Cerato Forte was used for the second generation, [ 1 ] while Naza Automotive Manufacturing of Malaysia has assembled the vehicle since 2009, selling it there under the name Naza Forte . [ 2 ] Production of the Forte ended in 2024 and it was replaced by the K4, as Kia realigned their passenger car nomenclature, with the K3 name being transferred to a subcompact car replacing the Kia Rio .

In North America , the Forte replaced the Kia Spectra , while the Forte retained the Cerato name in numerous markets. It shares the same platform as the Hyundai Avante/Elantra (HD) , though employing a torsion-beam rear suspension in place of the Elantra's multilink design. Kia has stated that the Forte was specifically designed to target younger buyers attracted to sharper auto designs. [ 5 ] Succeeding the first generation Cerato or second generation Spectra, several elements of the interior and suspension were changed. The car received a wider (4 cm) and longer (3 cm) body, a longer (4 cm) wheelbase and a wider (7 cm) gauge. However, ground clearance was reduced by a centimeter, thereby reducing the height by a centimeter. At the same time, the design of the rear suspension was simplified, which instead of independent multilink thrust became semi-dependent double-lever, with an elastic beam, which made it more reliable and easy to repair and maintain. [ citation needed ] Three body styles, which are compact 4-door sedan, 5-door hatchback, and a new 2-door coupe body style was introduced. Sedan [ edit ] The Forte sedan was designed in Kia's California design studio by Tom Kearns and his team. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The Forte two-door ("Koup") was previewed as the "Kia Koup" Concept, and was also designed in Kia's California design studio. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The Korean model went on sale on 22 August 2008. [ 10 ] The US model was unveiled at the 2009 Chicago Auto Show . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Hatchback [ edit ] The Forte five-door hatchback debuted at the 2010 New York International Auto Show . [ 13 ] Coupe (Koup) [ edit ] The two-door coupe "Forte Koup" was originally unveiled as a concept car in the form of the "Kia Koup" on 20 March 2008 at the New York International Auto Show . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] The concept sported a twin scroll turbocharged version of the 2.0-litre Theta II inline-four engine . The production Forte Koup is badged as the "Kia Cerato Koup" in Australia, Costa Rica, Russia and South Africa. It is called the "Kia Shuma" in China, and "Kia Koup" in Chile. Kia Forte Koup (South Korea) Kia Forte Koup (South Korea) LPI Hybrid [ edit ] In 2009, Kia unveiled the mild hybrid Forte at the Seoul Motor Show for the South Korean market. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Taking its underpinnings from the Hyundai Elantra LPI Hybrid , the car is powered by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) . It is powered with an 85-kilowatt (114 hp) 1.6-litre LPG engine coupled with a 15-kilowatt (20 hp) electric motor and a lithium-polymer battery pack, making it the first production car to use lithium-polymer batteries.

For the 2011 model year, the Forte is standard with a six-speed manual (replacing the 5 speed unit) and is available with an optional six-speed automatic, with the four- and five-speed automatics being discontinued. The LX is the base model. It comes standard with electronic stability control (ESC), and seat- and side-mounted airbags. The standard stereo includes four speakers, AM/FM radio, CD/MP3 player, and Sirius XM Satellite Radio . An iPod -compatible USB input jack and an auxiliary port for an external music device and steering wheel mounted audio controls are also integrated with the sound system. Bluetooth handsfree technology is also standard. [ 23 ] The second-tier EX adds air conditioning, power windows and door locks, cruise control, a six-speaker radio, a key fob with keyless entry, and turn signal indicators on the side mirrors. The SX has the 2.4-litre engine with a six-speed manual or optional five-speed automatic transmission for the 2010 model year and a six-speed from the 2011 model year. [ 24 ] The SX also adds alloy wheels, a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift lever, a tilting and telescoping steering column, sport-cloth seats, and a metallic finish to the interior. Later production models have soft-touch panels on the armrest and door, as well as on the dashboard. For 2011, the EX and SX sedans are automatic-only, while the base sedan and all models of the Koup and Forte5 continue to offer the choice of manual or automatic. An optional Fuel Economy Package adds low resistance silica tires, a more efficient alternator, a five-speed automatic transmission , and aerodynamic enhancements to increase fuel efficiency. With the Fuel Economy Package , the Forte EX has a 27 mpg ‑US (8.7 L/100 km; 32 mpg ‑imp ) fuel consumption in city driving and 36 mpg ‑US (6.5 L/100 km; 43 mpg ‑imp ) in highway according to United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). [ 25 ] Automatic transmission models include an "Eco" display on the instrument panel that tells the driver when better than expected fuel efficiency is reached, hoping to influence driving habits toward more efficient operation. For the Forte Koup, an optional leather package is available on both EX and SX trims. When combined with the EX trim, leather is utilized for the upholstery, steering wheel and shift lever; heated front seats and a sunroof are also included with the package. When paired with the SX trim, it includes only heated leather seats and the sunroof, as a leather-wrapped steering wheel and shift lever are already fitted as standard. [ 26 ] The Forte sold in Canada has similar specifications and equipment as the US-market model. Some differences include the addition of power windows, door locks and power heated exterior mirrors on the base LX trim, a telescopic steering wheel on the EX trim, and a standard sunroof and automatic climate control system on the SX trim. The EX and SX also have a chrome-trimmed rear garnish and door handles. In contrast to the transmissions offered in the United States, the automatic transmission on offer in Canada is a 6-speed. Asia [ edit ] Kia Forte R (Forte Furuidi) in China China [ edit ] For the Chinese market, Kia has offered the "Forte Furuidi" (福瑞迪) or Forte (later Forte R for the facelifted model) produced by the Dongfeng Yueda Kia since 2009. The Furuidi was unveiled at the Nanjing International Expo Centre, [ 27 ] and is available with the 1.6- Gamma and 2.0-litre Theta engines. "Furuidi" means luck and auspiciousness in the Chinese language—and has a pronunciation similar to its English name "Forte". [ 28 ] It was sold alongside the Cerato R (First generation Cerato facelift), and later the K3 (Second generation Forte). Malaysia [ edit ] In Malaysia , the first generation Forte is assembled by the joint-venture company Naza -Kia and is called the "Naza Forte" and in Singapore , the first generation Forte was called the "Kia Cerato Forte". Both regions were offered with the 1.6-litre Gamma and 2.0-litre Theta II engine variants featuring a four-speed automatic transmission at launch, and then received a six-speed automatic transmission with paddle shifters after the 2011 facelift. [ 29 ] Europe [ edit ] Kia Cerato interior In Russia and Ukraine , the Cerato (Forte) is available as the Cee'd's notchback counterpart, with the coupe and sedan available together. The Forte is not available in other European countries, due to the relatively low popularity of small family sedans there. Despite the LPI Hybrid being launched at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show , the Forte is still not offered in European countries outside Russia and Ukraine.

The all-new Forte was designed by Kia lead designer Peter Schreyer , who also designed the Kia Stinger . The exterior profile of the 2019 Forte resembles that of the Stinger, and certain interior styling cues, such as a "Floating" centre display touchscreen for the infotainment system, and round HVAC vents, were taken directly from the Stinger as well. North America [ edit ] United States [ edit ] The Kia Forte is available in four trim levels: base FE and LXS, mid-level S, and top-level EX.

[ 65 ] 2020 update [ edit ] The GT and GT-Line trim levels were added, and the S trim level was discontinued, as well as the 6-speed manual transmission option. The LX trim was also discontinued, and the LX was renamed LXS. [ 66 ] Australia [ edit ] The Kia Cerato was introduced in mid-2018 in sedan form only, available in three trim levels: S, Sport, and Sport+. In late 2018, the range was bolstered with the addition of the hatchback body style and GT trim level which features a 1.6L turbo petrol engine; it produces 150 kilowatts and 265 newton meters of torque. The lower trims are equipped with a 2.0 L Nu engine producing 112 kilowatts and 192 newton metres of torque. A 6-speed manual and a 6-speed torque converter automatic is available with the 2.0L models while a 7-speed dual clutch automatic is available with the 1.6L Turbo in the GT trim. Due to the lack of advanced AEB features as standard on the entry-level S and Sport variants, the Cerato received a split ANCAP safety rating, with S and Sport receiving a four-star rating and other models five-star. The fleet-only Si trim level was later added for the 2019 model year with advanced AEB as standard. Powertrain [ edit ] This list is incomplete ; you can help by adding missing items .
