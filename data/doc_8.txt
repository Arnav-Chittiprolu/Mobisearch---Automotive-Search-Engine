It is open to the public for ten days, filling 760,000 square feet (71,000 m 2 ) of exhibit space. Since 2006 the event is held in November or December. The LA Auto Show is an OICA sanctioned international exhibition.  It is one of the four major auto shows in North America [ citation needed ] together with Detroit , Chicago and New York . The show begins with AutoMobility LA, [ 1 ] a several day press showing. [ 2 ] History [ edit ] The Los Angeles Auto Show began in 1907 with ninety-nine vehicles on display at Morley's Skating Rink.  In 1910, the event was held under a canvas big top at Fiesta Park . [ 3 ] As the auto industry grew, the auto show changed venues four times throughout the 1920s to accommodate the growing needs of vendors. During the 1922 show, the sixteenth, a short circuit in one of the airplane exhibits caused a massive fire that destroyed the entire venue, resulting in over US$1 million ($18.8 million in 2024 dollars) worth of damages. There were no injuries. With the help of the community, the show reopened one day later at the Shrine Auditorium . In 1926, it took place at the corner of Hill and Washington where it stayed for the next four years. The show continued to prove successful throughout the 1930s, but took a down turn during the Second World War and went on hiatus from 1940 through 1951.  In 1952, the show re-opened at the Pan Pacific Auditorium with 152 vehicles on display, including those from international manufacturers. In 2006, the show moved its dates from early January to late November/early December, thus resulting in two shows during the year. The second 2006 event celebrated the show's centennial, despite its 100th year being 2007. AutoMobility LA [ edit ] In response to new technologies such as driver assist and cloud-based infotainment in the auto industry, the LA Auto Show organizers created the Connected Car Expo [ 4 ] in 2013. The LA Auto Show begins with AutoMobility LA, four days catered to journalists, designers and industry representatives.  In 2014, the show had 65 debuts, a record number.  From 2013 to 2015, the first of three Press & Trade Days was devoted to the Connected Car Expo, a mingling affair for automotive and technology professionals. Connected Car Expo was merged with the show's Press & Trade days to create AutoMobility LA in 2016. For 2016, AutoMobility LA also included several events, with four days of networking, three days of breaking news, and two days of learning. The Press & Trade Days Kickoff Party was held for industry and media professionals the night before AutoMobility LA Conference. The Green Car of the Year Awards presented by the Green Car Journal . 2019 also marked the 10th anniversary of the Hispanic Motor Press Awards, presented to the best cars as selected by a national jury composed of Hispanic journalist, bloggers, and influencers. (www.hispanicmotorpress.org) During the Design LA Open House & Reception, automotive design studios present concepts to a judging committee, and the winner of judges' pick as well as people's choice award are both announced during the annual reception. During the Green/Tech Ride & Drive, there were test drives of new tech and green advancements exclusively for media . Automobile designers finished out Design LA at the Designers’ Night Reception hosted by Car Design News , which was offsite and required separate registration to attend. 2025 [ edit ] The 2025 LA Auto show was held from November 21 to 30.
