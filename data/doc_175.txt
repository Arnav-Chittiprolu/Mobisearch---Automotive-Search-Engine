Help From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This is a tracking category . It is used to build and maintain a list or lists of pages—primarily for the sake of the lists themselves and their use in article and category maintenance. It is not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme . More information: This category is hidden on its member pages —unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. These categories are used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse " (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or subcategories into a larger, more efficient list ( discriminated by classifications ). Typically, tracking categories are automatically populated by templates invoked in pages or by the MediaWiki software (see Special:TrackingCategories for an overview of the latter). Administrators: Please do not delete this category as empty! This category may be empty occasionally or even most of the time. This tracking category lists pages with CS1 citations that use |url-status=usurped or |url-status=unfit . The keywords unfit and usurped are intended to identify original URLs that point to live sites that are inappropriate: spam, advertising, porn, etc. A URL that returns a HTTP 404 error is not considered to be unfit and, in such cases, editors should set |url-status=dead . CS1 and CS2 templates in pages listed in this category should be checked to ensure that the unfit and usurped keywords are correctly applied. Only Module:Citation/CS1 should directly add pages to this category. Other values [ edit ] |url-status=bot: unknown is tracked at Category:CS1 maint: bot: original URL status unknown . |url-status=dead is not tracked. |url-status=live is not tracked. |url-status=deviated is not tracked. |url-status=< anything else > is tracked at Category:CS1 errors: invalid parameter value .
