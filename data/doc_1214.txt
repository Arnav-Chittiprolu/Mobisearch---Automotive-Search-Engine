First generation cars were mostly marketed as the Optima, although the Kia Magentis name was used in Europe and Canada when sales began there in 2002. For the second-generation models, Kia used the Kia Lotze and Kia K5 name for the South Korean market, and the Magentis name globally, except in the United States , Canada , Malaysia and the Middle East , where the Optima name was retained until the 2021 model year. The K5 name is used for all markets since the introduction of the fifth generation in 2019.

It was first shown in South Korea in July 2000 and was the first product of the Kia-Hyundai platform integration plan. [ citation needed ] In Australia, the Optima was introduced in May 2001, offered only with a 2.5 L V6 engine, and choice of manual or automatic transmission . The updated Optima was offered with a new 2.7 L engine, 4-speed automatic (the manual was dropped), and features such as full leather interior and alloy wheels were made standard. Thanks in part to better marketing, sales increased to 41,289 units in 2005, an all-time high. The Optima was sold until 2006, when it was replaced by the Magentis.

This generation differed further from the Hyundai Sonata donor vehicle than the previous model. Unlike the previous Optima though, this vehicle uses a global platform, unique to Kia, designated "MG". The car continues to be built in South Korea and shares its 2.4-liter inline-four engine , five-speed Sportmatic automatic or five-speed manual transmission with the Sonata. In addition to the 2.4-liter inline-four and the 2.7-liter V6 offered in North America, globally the Optima/Magentis/Lotze was also available with smaller, 1.8- or 2.0-liter fours, as well as a 2.0-liter turbodiesel engine. South Korean buyers also received and LPG-powered version of the 2.4. The second generation Optima was launched in Malaysia on 15 August 2007 powered by a 2.0-liter Theta DOHC CVVT engine with a 4-speed automatic transmission. Safety [ edit ] The Optima received a crash test rating of five stars from the NHTSA , [ 6 ] and four stars from Euro NCAP . [ 7 ] The 2006 Optima received Marginal to Good ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).

This update features new front-end styling and tail lamps. In addition to the revised exterior, length is also slightly increased by roughly 70 millimetres (2.8 in) to approximately 4,800 mm (190 in) long. There is also a new engine and the interior has also been revised. [ 10 ] Main changes in the interior are a redesigned instrument cluster and a Sirius Satellite Radio /AM/FM/MP3/CD with an auxiliary jack. In certain markets, the option of satellite navigation is offered. The new Theta II 2.4-liter I4 employs dual continuously variable valve timing (CVVT) and a variable intake system (VIS) to increase power to 131 kW (176 hp), while returning improved fuel consumption over its predecessor. Torque is rated at 229 N⋅m (169 lbf⋅ft). There is a 2.0L I4 for other markets with either a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic transmission. Power is rated at 164 hp (122 kW) at 6200 RPM and 197 N⋅m (145 lb⋅ft) of torque. Acceleration for the 2.0L is 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 9.2 seconds for the 5-speed manual and 10.1 seconds for the 4-speed automatic. Top speed rated up to 208 km/h (129 mph) outside of the US. The 2.7-liter V6 offers few changes to the previous model, though power is increased to 144 kW (193 hp), and torque to 249 N⋅m (184 lbf⋅ft). Acceleration for the 5-speed automatic takes it from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) in 8.9sec with a top speed up to 220 km/h (137 mph). A five-speed manual transmission is standard in the base model, and a five-speed automatic is included with mid- and high-end levels (or as an option in the base model). 2010 models see the addition of a Proximity Key with Push-Button Start and paddle shifters on SX models. In Australia, the Magentis was introduced in August 2006, and replaced the Optima. Initially available with a choice of 2.4 L 4-cylinder or 2.7 L V6 engines, the Magentis' sales never caught on, with sales peaking at only 741 units in 2007. In 2008, the V6 engine was dropped, as was the EX-L model, leaving only the entry-level 2.4 L EX on sale until its discontinuation in 2009. While the facelifted 2010 model was never officially launched, a very small number were imported for "evaluation" purposes, and eventually sold to the public as demos.

It made its world debut at the 2010 New York International Auto Show . It features a new profile designed by Kia design chief Peter Schreyer , following the new design language featured on the Kia Forte , Kia Sorento , and Kia Sportage and Kia Cadenza — and using Kia's new corporate grille, known as the Tiger Nose , also designed by Schreyer. Lead designer of the TF in the team of Peter Schreyer and Miklos Kovacs was the Italian Davide Limongelli. For the first time, this model will be using the Optima name worldwide, where the Magentis name had been used previously. As with its Hyundai Sonata sibling, the Optima's lineup has been replaced with a GDI 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine, either mated to a 6-speed automatic transmission with Eco dash display, or to a 6-speed manual transmission that is standard on only the LX model. Sales began in fall 2010. The new K5 was released in the South Korean market on 29 April 2010. The new Optima retains its trim lines of the base LX, upscale EX, and sporty SX models. Standard equipment includes safety features such as electronic stability control (ESC) and ABS brakes, as well as Sirius Satellite Radio, cooled glove box, iPod connectivity, and handsfree Bluetooth phone operation. Starting in October 2013, on LX models, Kia will offer the UVO infotainment system by Microsoft as part of the convenience package.  EX model options include Kia's new UVO infotainment system by Microsoft , integrated backup camera, and Proximity Key with Push-Button Start. A panoramic moonroof , heated and cooled front seats, heated rear seats and a navigation system are also available. SX models add a rear spoiler , metal pedals, black hybrid metal and carbon insert trim, paddle shifters, and illuminated scuff plates. The third generation Optima came with two different ignition options. On some, the ignition is fitted to the steering column with a turn key. In certain specifications, the keyhole is inside of the glove box, with a start button located on the dashboard. Kia Optima assembly in Iraq
In 2015, the Babylon Automobile Plant, located in Babylon Governorate, Iraq , began assembling the Kia Optima from complete knock-down (CKD) kits. The operation was part of a partnership between Iraqi state-owned enterprises and Kia’s regional distributors. Imported body shells, engines, transmissions, and other components were assembled locally on production lines that included chassis fitting, engine installation, interior trim, and quality-control testing. The plant’s reported capacity ranged from 24 to 44 vehicles per day, depending on model mix and demand. While most major components were imported, the facility aimed to increase local content over time, supporting Iraq’s efforts to revive its automotive assembly industry. A Hybrid model and a Turbo model were also released. In addition, a wagon version was planned for European markets, and two-door coupé version was mooted for the United States. however they were never released. [ 12 ] The turbo model has  the same powertrain as the Hyundai Sonata 2.0T. [ 13 ] The turbocharged model has 274 hp (204 kW) and 269 lb⋅ft (365 N⋅m) of torque in the North American model. [ 14 ] The car is estimated to obtain 34 mpg ‑US (6.9 L/100 km; 41 mpg ‑imp ) on the highway. [ 15 ] The third generation Kia Optima is built and manufactured in West Point, Georgia , which began in 2011 with the 2012 model. In Australia, the new Optima went on sale in January 2011. Initially available in only one grade, the highly specified "Platinum", it was later joined by an entry-level "Si" model in the 2012 model year. Both models feature a 2.4L GDI engine with 6-speed automatic. A manual was not offered. The facelifted 2014 model was unveiled at the 2013 New York International Auto Show in March. The third generation Kia Optima was launched in Malaysia on 27 December 2011 powered by a 2.0 liter Theta II MPI engine with a 6-speed automatic transmission [ 16 ] and in January 2014 the facelift version was launched in Malaysia. [ 17 ] Safety [ edit ] The 2011 Optima received a "Top Safety Pick" rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS).

During its first month in the market sold 524 units. [ 21 ] Considering cumulative sales in the U.S. market through December 2011, with 19,672 units sold, together the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid and the Kia Optima Hybrid ranked second in hybrid sales for calendar year 2011, after the Toyota Prius . [ 22 ] The Optima Hybrid uses the Hyundai Sonata Hybrid powertrain , combining a 2.4-liter MPI engine with a six-speed automatic transmission, and a 30 kW electric motor and lightweight lithium polymer batteries to produce a full gasoline-electric hybrid with an estimated fuel consumption of 37 mpg ‑US (6.4 L/100 km; 44 mpg ‑imp ) city and 39 mpg ‑US (6.0 L/100 km; 47 mpg ‑imp ) highway. [ 23 ] The Optima Hybrid is able to travel up to 100 km/h (62 mph) in full electric mode, which helps it stand apart from many competitors. [ 24 ] Korean and European markets will get the Optima Hybrid with a 2.0-liter turbocharged engine. [ 25 ] The only externally apparent features that differentiate it from the Kia Optima are the hybrid badging, application specific wheel design, a lowered ride height by approximately 1 in (25 mm), and the availability of a special light platinum graphite paint color. It also utilizes an active shutter system behind the upper grille, allowing the car to redirect airflow when the gas engine's heat levels allow (such as when the car is operating in EV mode to improve aerodynamics, or to assist in more rapid warming up of the gas engine). [ 26 ] In September 2011, the Optima Hybrid set a Guinness World Record for "Lowest Fuel Consumption in a Hybrid Gasoline Vehicle" while driving across the continental United States for 14 days, starting from the Kia factory in West Point, Georgia. In its 7,899-mile drive across the 48 states, the car recorded an average of 64.55 miles per gallon while consuming a total of five and a half tanks of gasoline. In order to qualify for the record, the car had two people and luggage throughout the entire trip.

It shares a platform with the 2015 Hyundai Sonata , and offers a new design, with new features and enhancements. [ 30 ] As with the previous-generation Optima, the new model was designed by Kia's Chief of Design, Peter Schreyer . Unveiled at the 10th Seoul Motor Show in April 2015, the new K5 was released in the South Korean market on 15 July 2015. For the Malaysian market, the fourth generation Kia Optima was launched in May 2017 powered by the Theta II 2.0 liter turbocharged four-cylinder gasoline engine with a 6-speed automatic transmission. [ 31 ] Sportswagon [ edit ] At the 2016 Geneva Motor Show , Kia revealed the Sportswagon variant of the Optima.
