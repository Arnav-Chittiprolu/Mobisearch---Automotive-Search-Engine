From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Motor vehicle automatic transmission models Motor vehicle AWTF-80 SC Overview Manufacturer Aisin Seiki Production 2005 – 2019 Model years 2005 – 2019 Body and chassis Class 6-Speed Transverse Automatic Transmission Related Ford 6R GM 6L ZF 6HP Chronology Predecessor Aisin TB-50LS Successor Aisin-Toyota 8-speed The Aisin AW TF-8# SC series is a 6-speed automatic transmission designed for use in transverse engine applications produced by Aisin Seiki . It is built in Anjō , Japan, [ 1 ] and is also called TF-80SC [ 2 ] (AWF21), AF40-6, AM6, [ 3 ] AW6A-EL and TF-81SC (AF21). [ 4 ] All-wheel drive transfer cases can be fitted to the AWTF-80 SC. It uses a Lepelletier gear mechanism , [ 5 ] an epicyclic/planetary gearset , which can provide more gear ratios with significantly fewer components. This means the Aisin AW TF-8# SC series is actually lighter than its five-speed predecessors. The Ford 6R , GM 6L , and ZF 6HP transmissions are based on the same globally patented gearset concept. The AWTF-80 SC is the only one for transverse engine installation. Gear Ratios [ a ] Model First Delivery Gear Total Span Avg.

The layout brings the ability to shift in a non-sequential manner – going from gear 6 to gear 2 in extreme situations simply by changing one shift element (actuating clutch E and releasing brake A). Extent [ edit ] In order to increase the number of ratios, ZF has abandoned the conventional design method of limiting themselves to pure in-line epicyclic gearing and extended it to a combination with parallel epicyclic gearing . This was only possible thanks to computer-aided design and has resulted in a globally patent for this gearset concept. The AWTF-80 is based on the 6HP from ZF , which was the first transmission designed according to this new paradigm. After gaining additional gear ratios only with additional components, this time the number of components has to decrease while the number of ratios still increase. The progress is reflected in a much better ratio of the number of gears to the number of components used compared to existing layouts.

It depends on the power flow: parallel: using the two degrees of freedom of planetary gearsets to increase the number of gears with unchanged number of components serial: in-line combined planetary gearsets without using the two degrees of freedom to increase the number of gears a corresponding increase in the number of components is unavoidable ^ a b c d e f Innovation Elasticity Classifies Progress And Market Position Automobile manufacturers drive forward technical developments primarily in order to remain competitive or to achieve or defend technological leadership. This technical progress has therefore always been subject to economic constraints Only innovations whose relative additional benefit is greater than the relative additional resource input, i.e. whose economic elasticity is greater than 1, are considered for realization The required innovation elasticity of an automobile manufacturer depends on its expected return on investment. The basic assumption that the relative additional benefit must be at least twice as high as the relative additional resource input helps with orientation negative, if the output increases and the input decreases, is perfect 2 or above is good 1 or above is acceptable (red) below this is unsatisfactory (bold) ^ Direct Predecessor To reflect the progress of the specific model change ^ a b c d plus 1 reverse gear ^ a b of which 2 gearsets are combined as a compound Ravigneaux gearset ^ Reference Standard (Benchmark) 3-speed transmissions with torque converters have established the modern market for automatic transmissions and thus made it possible in the first place, as this design proved to be a particularly successful compromise between cost and performance It became the archetype and dominated the world market for around 3 decades, setting the standard for automatic transmissions. It was only when fuel consumption became the focus of interest that this design reached its limits, which is why it has now completely disappeared from the market What has remained is the orientation that it offers as a reference standard (point of reference, benchmark) for this market for determining progressiveness and thus the market position of all other, later designs All transmission variants consist of 7 main components Typical examples are Turbo-Hydramatic from GM Cruise-O-Matic from Ford TorqueFlite from Chrysler Detroit Gear from BorgWarner for Studebaker BW-35 from BorgWarner and as T35 from Aisin 3N 71 from Nissan / Jatco 3 HP from ZF Friedrichshafen W3A 040 and W3B 050 from Mercedes-Benz Gearbox control [ edit ] To reduce external wiring as well as to provide a constant environment for the transmission control module (TCM), it is located inside the transmission housing. Gear shifting is managed by a computer program that oversees a clutch-to-clutch actuation that allows one clutch engage the instant the clutch from the previous gear disengages. When idling and with the foot brake depressed neutral gear is selected automatically.  This helps to reduce internal temperatures and improve the fuel economy. Features Maximum shift speed 7,000/min 6,500/min Maximum torque 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft ) 400 N⋅m (295 lb⋅ft ) Torque converter diameter 260 mm (10.2 in ) Length 358 mm (14.1 in ) Weight 90 kg (198 lb ) Gearset Concept: Layout [ edit ] A conventional 5-pinion planetary gearset and a compound Ravigneaux gearset is combined in a Lepelletier gear mechanism , [ 5 ] to reduce both the size and weight. It was first realized in 2000 with the 6HP from ZF Friedrichshafen . Like all transmissions realized with Lepelletier transmissions, the AWTF-80 SC also dispenses with the use of the direct gear ratio, making it one of the very few automatic transmission concepts without such a ratio. It also has the capability to achieve torque converter lock-up on all 6 forward gears, and disengage it completely when at a standstill, significantly closing the fuel efficiency gap between automatic and manual transmissions . Gearset Concept: Quality [ edit ] The ratios of the 6 gears are evenly distributed in all versions. Exceptions are the large step from 1st to 2nd gear and the almost geometric steps from 3rd to 4th to 5th gear. They cannot be eliminated without affecting all other gears. As the large step is shifted due to the large span to a lower speed range than with conventional gearboxes, it is less significant. As the gear steps are smaller overall due to the additional gear(s), the geometric gear steps are still smaller than the corresponding gear steps of conventional gearboxes. Overall, therefore, the weaknesses are not overly significant. As the selected gearset concept saves up to 2 components compared to 5-speed transmissions, the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages. In a Lepelletier gearset , [ 5 ] a conventional planetary gearset and a composite Ravigneaux gearset are combined to reduce both the size and weight as well as the manufacturing costs. Like all transmissions realized with Lepelletier transmissions, the 6L also dispenses with the use of the direct gear ratio and is thus one of the very few automatic transmission concepts without such a ratio.

Average Gear Step — With steadily decreasing gear steps ( yellow highlighted line Step ) and a particularly large step from 1st to 2nd gear the lower half of the gear steps (between the small gears; rounded down, here the first 2) is always larger and the upper half of the gear steps (between the large gears; rounded up, here the last 3) is always smaller than the average gear step (cell highlighted yellow two rows above on the far right) lower half: smaller gear steps are a waste of possible ratios (red bold) upper half: larger gear steps are unsatisfactory (red bold) ^ a b c d e f g Standard R:1 — Reverse And 1st Gear Have The Same Ratio — The ideal reverse gear has the same transmission ratio as 1st gear no impairment when maneuvering especially when towing a trailer a torque converter can only partially compensate for this deficiency Plus 11.11 % minus 10 % compared to 1st gear is good Plus 25 % minus 20 % is acceptable (red) Above this is unsatisfactory (bold) see also

ratio Power loss for single meshing gears is in the range of 1 % to 1.5 % helical gear pairs, which are used to reduce noise in passenger cars, are in the upper part of the loss range spur gear pairs, which are limited to commercial vehicles due to their poorer noise comfort, are in the lower part of the loss range ^ a b c d e f g Corridor for specific torque and efficiency in planetary gearsets, the stationary gear ratio i 0 {\displaystyle i_{0}} is formed via the planetary gears and thus by two meshes for reasons of simplification, the efficiency for both meshes together is commonly

_{0}=0.9800} (upper value) and η 0 = 0.9700 {\displaystyle \eta _{0}=0.9700} (lower value) for both interventions together The corresponding efficiency for single-meshing gear pairs is η 0 1 2 {\displaystyle {\eta _{0}}^{\tfrac {1}{2}}} at 0.9800 1 2 = 0.98995 {\displaystyle 0.9800^{\tfrac {1}{2}}=0.98995} (upper value) and 0.9700 1 2 = 0.98489 {\displaystyle 0.9700^{\tfrac {1}{2}}=0.98489}
