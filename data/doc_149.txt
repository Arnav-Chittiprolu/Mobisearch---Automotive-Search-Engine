( July 2010 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) A wave-powered ship is a ship, propelled harnessing the energy of the waves. Ships [ edit ] Constructed boats [ edit ] As yet, there is only one boat that is propelled by wave harnessing fins: Suntory Mermaid II [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Mermaid II uses a passive fin mechanism mounted at the bow. A combination of fins and springs capture wave energy, then release it as a propelling drive forwards. Ship concepts [ edit ] 1. Ship concepts having wave harnessing fins like the "Suntory Mermaid, described above: E/S Orcelle [ 4 ] A conceptual design for a large car ferry has been projected. This is planned to use wave energy as a minor component of its energy supply, the major source of which is hydrogen fuel . 2. Ships with several hulls, that are movable among one another: The "Oeko-Trimaran" [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Using the principles of the stationary " Pelamis wave power " plants to produce hydrogen fuel by wave energy. Also sun and wind (Wind turbine) energy are used for fuel production, which work also during the mooring times of the ship.
