Lincoln Motor Company was a good article , but it was removed from the list as it no longer met the good article criteria at the time. There are suggestions below for improving the article. If you can improve it, please do ; it may then be renominated . Review: November 15, 2006. Archives no archives yet ( create ) Sale to Ford [ edit ] Regarding the history of Lincoln, we learn in one paragraph that: "The Lincoln Motor Company was active until April 30, 1940", while in the very next paragraph we're informed that Ford purchased Lincoln in 1922. While I realize that on some level the two statements need not be mutually exclusive, some manner of clarification of the matter would be helpful for readers.-- 172.190.17.37 ( talk ) 05:40, 29 February 2012 (UTC) [ reply ] Audi of Volkswagen? [ edit ] "Lexus of Toyota, Infiniti of Nissan, Acura of Honda, and Audi of Volkswagen." You can't put it this way. Audi is NOT to VW what Lexus is to Toyota or Inifiniti to Nissan. And definitely not what Acura is to Honda. You've gathered three different marketing strategies in a half of a sentense. Lexus is a separate luxury brand with vehicles based on proven and successful domestic market models. Infinitis and Acuras are rebadged luxury versions of the mother company's models. Audi only shares platforms with VW without any similarity in the model ranges and enjoys full independence within VAG. Anyway, there's no prooflink so it's pure and simple original research.

History Section Reconstruction [ edit ] The content before 1940 was fine, so I left that stand, but as far as organization went, that was all that was there, so the section has been re-organized into something that can actually be edited for content beginning to end.  I know it needs some further work, but now there is at least something to work with.  --SteveCof00 10:31, 2 June 2013 (UTC) External links modified [ edit ] Hello fellow Wikipedians, I have just added archive links to 2 external links on Lincoln Motor Company .

At that time the Lincoln engine had a larger displacement and more power than the flathead engine used in Ford cars, giving it an advantage.  From 1954, when the Fords started using the Y-block OHV V-8 in place of the flathead, the Lincoln no longer had a power advantage, and did have a significant weight disadvantage.  Thus from 1954 Lincoln no longer appeared in NASCAR races, with those drivers desiring a Ford product using either a Ford or Mercury. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2601:589:300:CA70:49B1:5B7E:C812:F722 ( talk ) 01:11, 2 December 2019 (UTC) [ reply ] Added a photo [ edit ] Added an image of a Continental Mark III to the infobox so that there is a recognizable image when you search for the company. Send me a message if this doesn't look good. I think the Mark III is a good choice because it has the iconic slab side look, and represents a portion of Lincoln's long-running mark series. It also helps that I just uploaded this awesome photo of a Continental Mark III ^-^ Let me know if you don't like this image and I can find something else that might work GeorgeRoush5 ( talk ) 16:59, 11 July 2022 (UTC) [ reply ] It is far from normal practice to illustrate any particular car model in the infobox, as the criteria for inclusion would be far too subjective. There would need to be a broad consensus to change the standard format for these articles, so a discussion at the project talk page would be required. -- Sable232 ( talk ) 21:01, 11 July 2022 (UTC) [ reply ] Since lincoln doesn't have its own headquarters to match the project standard, am I good to add a photo of the Ford headquarters? Continuing to leave it blank doesn't seem to be a good option GeorgeRoush5 ( talk ) 00:26, 12 July 2022 (UTC) [ reply ] The company logo is often used as the lead image.
