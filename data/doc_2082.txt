[ 4 ] As Cadillac's first fully electric vehicle, and the first GM production vehicle using the BEV3 platform , the Lyriq introduces a new version of GM's Super Cruise semi-autonomous driving system. [ 5 ] Assembled at Spring Hill Manufacturing in Spring Hill, Tennessee for North America and at a new EV-only plant in Yantai, China for Asia, Cadillac started accepting customer orders for the 2023 Lyriq in the United States in May 2022. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] In late 2024, Cadillac Lyriq won the German " Car of the Year 2025 " award in the luxury car category. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] History [ edit ] See also: General Motors BEV3 platform At the 2019 North American International Auto Show , CEO Mary Barra presented several details about the group's upcoming series of EVs, [ 11 ] which included a crossover from Cadillac. [ 12 ] The name Lyriq follows a pattern of several prior Cadillac concept vehicles, including the Evoq , Provoq , and Celestiq , all ending in "q". [ 13 ] Cadillac originally planned for a US -market presentation of the Lyriq (as a "show car" or concept car ) on April 2, 2020, followed by a launch soon thereafter for the 2021 model year . Due to the COVID-19 pandemic , [ 14 ] it was postponed to August 6. [ 15 ] Production of the Lyriq was also delayed to early 2022. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Chinese and Asian market production at a new plant at Shanghai GM 's Yantai complex built for Ultium will start slightly before Spring Hill starts Lyriq assembly for North America. [ citation needed ] Following the public debut of the Lyriq show car at the 2021 Shanghai Auto Show , the production version was presented on April 21, 2021. [ 7 ] Batteries for both Yantai and Spring Hill production will be sourced from LG Chem , with Spring Hill initially getting pouch-type Ultium cells from an LG Chem plant in South Korea . This will be done until GM and LG Chem expand Spring Hill to accommodate Ultium battery production for both domestic use and exports to Mexico. [ citation needed ] According to Cadillac, all the interior components were newly designed for the Lyriq and no pre-existing GM parts were used. [ 18 ] Markets [ edit ] Production of the Lyriq for all markets is at the Spring Hill, Tennessee plant in the US, except for China, where it is produced locally. Sport & Luxury trims in Argent Silver & Nimbus Metallic Rear view Interior first row Interior second row Cadillac Lyriq spotted in Washington DC China [ edit ] Pre-orders for the Lyriq opened in China in November 2021 with over 5,000 pre-orders within half a month, with reservations opening in June 2022 and deliveries beginning in October that year, or December for the all-wheel drive model. [ 19 ] It was initially offered with a 95.7 kWh battery pack but retained the same motor setup as other markets, allowing for CLTC range ratings of 653 km (406 mi) for rear-wheel drive and 600 km (373 mi) for all-wheel drive. [ 20 ] A new base version was introduced at Auto Guangzhou 2023 in November, equipped with fewer features and a single 335 hp (250 kW; 340 PS) motor with 440 lb⋅ft (600 N⋅m) of torque, allowing for a lower price. It has a CLTC range rating of 502 kilometres (312 mi). [ 21 ] The Lyriq-V was unveiled in China in March 2025 with sales to begin later in the year as a 2026. It will be produced locally, and is the first Cadillac V model to be sold in the country. [ 22 ] Europe [ edit ] Cadillac Europe introduced the Lyriq with a direct-to-consumer sales model in Europe in 2024, first entering Switzerland, followed by Sweden, France and Germany. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] It is available exclusively with the all-wheel drive powertrain rated at 528 hp (394 kW; 535 PS). Japan [ edit ] A right-hand drive version of the Lyriq was unveiled in Japan in December 2024, with sales expected to begin in the second quarter of 2025. [ 27 ] Pre-orders started in March 2025 with deliveries to be made in May 2025. [ 27 ] It will be built at the Spring Hill, Tennessee manufacturing plant. [ 28 ] In April 2025, Cadillac Japan launched an exhibition tour of the Lyriq. [ 29 ] North America [ edit ] The Lyriq was first delivered to American dealerships in the highest demand markets of New York, Los Angeles, and Detroit in the first week of July 2022. [ 30 ] GM delivered a total of 122 Lyriqs to U.S. customers in 2022. [ 31 ] For the 2024 model year, EPA range estimates for the dual motor models increased from 312 miles (502 km) to 314 miles (505 km). Additionally, a new $1200 optional OTA update for dual motor models, called the Velocity Package, increases the torque output and allows for a reduction in 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) times from 4.7 to 4.4 seconds. [ 32 ] A more conventional door access system was implemented, with remote activated flush pop-out handles replacing an electronic unlatch button which lacked discrete handles. [ 33 ] For the 2025 model year, the base Tech trim level was dropped, and the model is produced with 24% fewer parts. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Additionally, it receives an increase in power output to 365 hp (272 kW; 370 PS) for rear-wheel drive and 515 hp (384 kW; 522 PS) for all-wheel drive, with torque numbers maintained. Range increases to 326 miles (525 km) for rear-wheel drive models, and 303 or 319 miles (488 or 513 km) for all-wheel drive models depending on the trim level. [ 36 ] In January 2025, Cadillac introduced the Lyriq-V, joining the " V-Series " of high-performance models. It is expected to launch later in 2025 as a 2026 model. [ 37 ] Oceania [ edit ] The Lyriq was introduced to Australia and New Zealand in October 2024 with right-hand drive. [ 38 ] It is available exclusively with the all-wheel drive powertrain, and the 102 kWh battery providing 530 kilometres (329 mi) of range on the WLTP cycle. It is produced at the Spring Hill, Tennessee manufacturing plant. [ 39 ] South Korea [ edit ] The Lyriq began sales in South Korea in July 2024, available with all-wheel drive and 465 kilometres (289 mi) of range from the 102 kWh battery pack. [ 40 ] Specifications [ edit ] Powertrain [ edit ] At debut, the Cadillac Lyriq was offered with a single motor driving the rear wheels, [ 7 ] while dual motor all-wheel drive models became available for the 2024 model year. [ 41 ] In both configurations, synchronous AC motors with permanent magnets and bar wound stator is used. The single motor generates 340 hp (254 kW; 345 PS) and 325 lb⋅ft (441 N⋅m; 45 kg⋅m) torque, while the all-wheel drive, dual motor version adds an additional motor to the front axle and has an estimated combined output of 500 hp (373 kW; 507 PS) and 450 lb⋅ft (610 N⋅m), increasing to 524 lb⋅ft (710 N⋅m) with the Velocity Package. [ 41 ] The motors draw from a 102 kWh gross capacity (100 kWh usable capacity [ citation needed ] ) Ultium battery with an EPA estimated 314 miles (505 km) range for the single motor, and 307 miles (494 km) for dual motor models. The single motor drivetrain achieves a combined 89 mpg‑e (38 kW⋅h/100 mi) under EPA testing, while the dual motor is rated at 88 mpg‑e (38 kW⋅h/100 mi). [ 42 ] The vehicle supports 19.2 kW Level 2 AC charging and DC fast charging at up to 190 kW. [ 43 ] [ 41 ] Chassis [ edit ] The Lyriq was the first vehicle built upon GM's third generation BEV platform called BEV3 . It is a unibody chassis with a skateboard style powertrain, where the battery is a flat shape that sits underneath the floor of the vehicle. All models have five-link multilink suspension paired with passively frequency sensitive hydraulic dampers on both the front and rear axles. In addition to regenerative braking , the vehicle is equipped with 17 in (430 mm) brakes on the front wheels, and 18 in (460 mm) rotors on the rear wheels. Run-flat all-season tires fitted to 20 inch wheels are standard on all trims, with 22 inch wheels optional. All-wheel drive models have a 3,500 lb (1,600 kg) towing capacity, while rear wheel drive models have no tow rating. [ 44 ] Lyriq-V [ edit ] The Lyriq-V increases the power of the dual-motor, all-wheel drive Lyriq, with a peak output of 615 hp (459 kW; 624 PS) and 650 lb⋅ft (881 N⋅m) of torque. [ 37 ] This output can only be achieved in a driver-selected "Velocity Max" mode, which Cadillac claims can accelerate the Lyriq to 60 mph in 3.3 seconds. The Lyriq-V adds a "V-Mode" control to customize performance settings and sound output. It uses the same 102 kWh battery as the dual-motor Lyriq, with a slightly decreased range of 285 miles (459 km) estimated. The suspension is lowered with standard continuous damping control, and the steering ratio is changed for a quicker response.
