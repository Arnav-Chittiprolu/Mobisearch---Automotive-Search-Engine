Singulato started plans for small batch production in the end of 2017 and mass production started by March 2018. The Singulato iS6 electric SUV was priced between ¥200,000 and ¥300,000. [ 2 ] In October 2016, Anhui Singulato Intelligent New Energy Vehicle Co., Ltd. was established, jointly held by Zhiche Youxing Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. and Jiangren Automotive Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd.

In addition, Singulato is also working on developing autonomous vehicle technology and big data. [ 4 ] In February 2018, Singulato announced its model plans to design and introduce 6 electric cars for the domestic Chinese market over the next few years.
