Often considered one of the most accomplished and influential electric guitarists, Hendrix wrote most of his own material in a variety of styles. Some show his blues and R&B roots, and others incorporate jazz and early funk influences. Some songs, such as " Purple Haze ", " Voodoo Child (Slight Return) ", and " Machine Gun ", feature his guitar-dominated hard rock and psychedelic rock sound, while others including " The Wind Cries Mary " and " Little Wing " take a slower, more melodic approach. Two of his best-known single releases were written by others: " Hey Joe " by Billy Roberts and " All Along the Watchtower " by Bob Dylan . Hendrix supplied his own interpretations, however, which gave them a much different character than the originals.

It is found in the montane forests of Myanmar, Laos, southern China, and central Vietnam. These birds mainly inhabit the understorey of broadleaf evergreen forests, usually living at an elevation of 1,800 to 2,500 metres (5,900 to 8,200 ft) above sea level. The red-tailed laughingthrush has an overall length of about 26 to 28 centimetres (10 to 11 in) and a weight of about 66 to 93 grams (2.3 to 3.3 oz). It is dull ochrous-grey, with a bright rufous-chestnut crown and a blackish face, with whitish ear-coverts. The wings and tail are crimson, and the sexes are similar in appearance. The species feeds mainly on insects and small arthropods, but sometimes also takes berries and fruits. Its breeding season lasts from April to June, and it makes nests composed principally of grasses and bamboo leaves. This red-tailed laughingthrush was photographed in a nature reserve near Ngọc Linh , a mountain in central Vietnam.
