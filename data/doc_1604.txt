An early form of suspension on [[Bullock cart|ox-drawn carts]] had the platform swing on iron chains attached to the wheeled frame of the carriage. This system remained the basis for most suspension systems until the turn of the 19th century, although the iron chains were replaced with the use of leather straps called thoroughbraces by the 17th century. No modern automobiles have used the thoroughbrace suspension system.

By approximately 1750, [[Leaf spring|leaf springs]] began appearing on certain types of carriage, such as the [[Landau (carriage)|Landau]].<ref name="Sheldon">{{cite book |title=Leaf Springs: Their Characteristics and Methods of Specification |date=1912 |publisher=Sheldon Axle Company |location=Wilkesbarre, Pennsylvania |page=[https://archive.org/details/leafspringstheir00land/page/1 1] |url= https://archive.org/details/leafspringstheir00land|quote=leaf spring.}}</ref>

By the middle of the 19th century, elliptical springs might additionally start to be used on carriages.

===Modern suspension===

[[File:'24 Ford Model T (Auto classique Ste-Rose '11).JPG|thumb|The front suspension components of a [[Ford Model T]].]]

Automobiles were initially developed as self-propelled versions of horse-drawn vehicles. However, horse-drawn vehicles had been designed for relatively slow speeds, and their suspension was not well suited to the higher speeds permitted by the internal combustion engine.

The first workable spring-suspension required advanced metallurgical knowledge and skill, and only became possible with the advent of [[Industrial Revolution|industrialisation]]. Obadiah Elliott registered the first patent for a spring-suspension vehicle; each wheel had two durable steel [[leaf spring]]s on each side and the body of the carriage was fixed directly to the springs which were attached to the [[axle]]s. Within a decade, most British horse [[carriage]]s were equipped with springs; wooden springs in the case of light one-horse vehicles to avoid [[taxation]], and steel springs in larger vehicles. These were often made of [[carbon steel|low-carbon steel]] and usually took the form of multiple layer leaf springs.<ref>{{cite book |last=Adams |first=William Bridges |title=English Pleasure Carriages |publisher=Charles Knight & Co. |location=London, United Kingdom |url= https://archive.org/details/englishpleasure01adamgoog |year=1837}}</ref>

Leaf springs have been around since the early [[Egyptians]]. Ancient military engineers used leaf springs in the form of bows to power their [[siege engine]]s, with little success at first. The use of leaf springs in [[catapult]]s was later refined and made to work years later. Springs were not only made of metal; a sturdy tree branch could be used as a spring, such as with a bow. Horse-drawn carriages and [[Ford Model T]] used this system, and it is still used today in larger vehicles, mainly mounted in the rear suspension.<ref name=ID3>{{cite web |title=Suspension Basics 3 - Leaf Springs |work=Initial Dave |url= http://www.initialdave.com/cars/tech/suspensionbasics03.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100508140405/http://www.initialdave.com/cars/tech/suspensionbasics03.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-05-08 |access-date=2015-01-29}}</ref>

Leaf springs were the first modern suspension system, and, along with advances in the [[Macadam|construction of roads]], heralded the single greatest improvement in road transport until the advent of the [[automobile]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=wagon and carriage |url= http://escola.britannica.com.br/article/277634/wagon-and-carriage?view=print |publisher=Encyclopaedia Britannica}}</ref> The British steel springs were not well-suited for use on [[United States|America]]'s rough roads of the time, so the [[Abbot-Downing Company]] of [[Concord, New Hampshire]] re-introduced leather strap suspension, which gave a swinging motion instead of the jolting up-and-down of spring suspension.

In 1901, [[Mors (automobile)|Mors]] of [[Paris]] first fitted an automobile with [[shock absorber]]s. With the advantage of a damped suspension system on his 'Mors Machine', Henri Fournier won the prestigious Paris-to-Berlin race on 20 June 1901. Fournier's superior time was 11&nbsp;hours 46&nbsp;minutes and 10&nbsp;seconds, while the best competitor was Léonce Girardot in a Panhard with a time of 12&nbsp;hours, 15&nbsp;minutes, and 40&nbsp;seconds.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Washington Times |date=30 June 1901 |publisher=chroniclingamerica.loc.gov |url= http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn87062245/1901-06-30/ed-1/seq-1/;words=Paris+races+Berlin+race+Race |access-date=2012-08-16}}</ref>

[[Coil spring]]s first appeared on a [[production vehicle]] in 1906 in the [[Brush Runabout]] made by the Brush Motor Company.
Today, coil springs are used in most cars.

In 1920, [[Leyland Motors]] used [[torsion bar suspension|torsion bars]] in a suspension system.

In 1922, independent front suspension was pioneered on [[Lancia Lambda]], and became more common in mass market cars from 1932.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Jain |first1=K.K. |first2=R.B. |last2=Asthana |title=Automobile Engineering |year=2002 |publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill |location=London |pages=293–294 |isbn=0-07-044529-X}}</ref> Today, most cars have [[independent suspension]] on all four wheels.

The part on which pre-1950 springs were supported is called a [[dumb iron]].

In 2002, a new passive suspension component, the [[inerter (mechanical networks)|inerter]], was invented by [[Malcolm C. Smith]]. This has the ability to increase the effective [[inertia]] of wheel suspension using a geared flywheel, but without adding significant mass. It was initially employed in [[Formula One]] in secrecy, but has since spread to wider motorsport.
