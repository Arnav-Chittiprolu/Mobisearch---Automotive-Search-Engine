It is the historical centre of the geographical region of Šumadija in central Serbia, and is situated on the banks of the Lepenica River . According to the 2022 census, the city itself has a population of 146,318 while the city administrative area has 171,186 inhabitants. Kragujevac was the first capital of modern Serbia and the first constitution in the Balkans , the Sretenje Constitution , was proclaimed in the city in 1835. A unit of the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service was located there in World War I. During the Second World War, Kragujevac was the site of a massacre by the Nazis in which 2,778 Serb men and boys were killed. Modern Kragujevac is known for its large munitions ( Zastava Arms ) and automobile ( Fiat Serbia ) industries, as well as its status as an education centre housing the University of Kragujevac , one of the region's largest higher education institutions. Etymology [ edit ] The name Kragujevac comes from 'kraguj' the Serbian name for cinereous vulture . In the Middle Ages, this bird was common in the woods of the area, and was used for hunting. The city's name means 'kraguj's tower', and the bird is represented on the city's coat of arms. [ 5 ] History [ edit ] Early and medieval [ edit ] Over 200 archaeological sites in Šumadija confirm that the region's first human settlement took place around 40,000 years ago during the Paleolithic era. The Jerina cave, located near the village of Gradac in the direction of Batočina , is dated to have been inhabited from around 37,000 BP to 27,000 BP. Dugouts dated to 5,000 BC have been found in the city's vicinity, in the localities of Grivac , Kusovac , Divostin , Donje Grbice and Dobrovodica . [ 6 ] These remains belong to the Neolithic Starčevo culture , which, in this area, spread along the river valleys of Lepenica and Gruža . The best known artifacts are the fertility figurines called Divostinke ("Girls from Divostin"). [ 7 ] At the time of Roman conquest in 9 AD, the territory of the present-day city was largely inhabited by Illyrians (mainly the Dardani ) and Celts (the Scordisci ). [ 6 ] By the late 6th and early 7th centuries, large-scale Slavic raids and settlement began, along with invasions from Hunnic and Germanic tribes. Later, the area would become part of the First Bulgarian Empire . With the weakening of both the Bulgarian and Eastern Roman empires, Stefan Nemanja , Grand Prince of the consolidated medieval Serbian state , captured the territory between 1198 and 1199. Although it is hypothesized that the current area of the city was densely settled by the time of Stefan Nemanja's conquest, it does not appear in medieval Serbian documents. [ 6 ] The first written mention of the city was in an Ottoman cadastral survey ( defter ) in 1476 after the city's incorporation into the Sanjak of Smederevo . [ 8 ] Referred to as 'Kraguyfoça', the settlement, after Ottoman conquest, consisted of a square formerly used as a market with 32 houses. The surrounding region was largely empty; even the forests that once dominated the region had been burned. By the end of the same century, however, the Ottoman administration began to slowly resettle the city's area; by the 1536 cadastral survey, the town had 7 Muslim neighborhoods ( mahalas ) with 56 houses in total, along with a Christian community of 29 houses. On the left bank of the Lepenica, a mosque was erected. [ 6 ] [ 9 ] Habsburg-Ottoman conflict and major revolts [ edit ] A map of the Habsburg-era Kragujevac fortress surrounded by a moat, 1738 In spite of its newfound consolidation under Turkish rule, the town's location in strategic borderland between the Habsburg monarchy and the Ottoman Empire made it an area of frequent conflict in the modern era. During the Great Turkish War , the Austrians, under Louis of Baden , pushed the Turks far to the south of the city. Although this occupation was short-lived, it spelled an end to consolidated Ottoman rule in the region. Soon after, in 1718, Kragujevac became a part of the Habsburg Kingdom of Serbia following conquest by Prince Eugene of Savoy and the signing of Treaty of Passarowitz . Under Austrian occupation, Kragujevac was fortified, the Muslim population was driven out and it became a hajduk town. It was exclusively inhabited by Serbian Orthodox members of the national militia with their families. As one of the districts lying right on the Ottoman border, moreover, it was controlled by an hajduk company (of the fourteen that guarded the frontier) and found itself under military jurisdiction.  Accordingly, its chief was a Serbian military officer, First Captain Staniša Marković Mlatišuma , the second highest authority of the Serbian militia . In 1725 the first officially recorded cases of vampirism occurred in Kragujevac, in which two alleged vampires were accused of murdering 42 people. [ 10 ] In other parts of Habsburg ruled Kingdom of Serbia similar cases followed after which the Serbian word vampir entered German and later other world languages. [ 11 ] As the Ottomans retook the town in 1739, and lost it again in 1789 to the same enemy, the town was ripe for new rule—this time under Serbian rebels. [ 6 ] [ 12 ] A scale model of royal complex founded by Miloš Obrenović As a settlement central to the Sanjak of Smederevo under Ottoman rule, Kragujevac was of utmost strategic importance to its agitating, largely rural Serb inhabitants. Therefore, it became a centre of the Serbian Revolution , a national awakening of Serbs led by the grand vožd , Karađorđe . First liberated on 5 April 1804 during the First Serbian Uprising , the city was finally freed from imperial rule during the Second Serbian Uprising in 1815. [ citation needed ] In 1818, Kragujevac, though largely depopulated following the conflicts of the preceding centuries, was proclaimed capital of the Principality of Serbia on 6 May 1818 by Miloš Obrenović in the medieval Vraćevšnica monastery . To mark the occasion, he built the Royal residence on the left bank of the Lepenica river. Amidža Konak is the only remaining building from the complex and the only landmark of 19th century Ottoman architecture in the city. [ 13 ] The first institutions of the Principality of Serbia were founded in Kragujevac including the first courthouse, First gymnasium (grammar school) and the Princely Serbian theatre . The first Serbian constitution, the Sretenje Constitution , was proclaimed in the city on 15 September 1835. It was one of the most liberal European constitutions of its time, modeled on the French and Belgian constitutions. Industrial development [ edit ] Although the capital was moved from Kragujevac to Beograd ( Belgrade ) in 1841, the importance of Kragujevac only increased during the remainder of the 19th century as it grew into a city marked by its industry. Following centuries of economic underdevelopment, the underpinnings of the city's modernization—and Serbia's main munitions manufacturer, Zastava Arms —were laid in the commissioning of the city's foundry complex in 1835. Known under its Serbian acronym VTZ, the complex was completed in 1850, and the first cannon was cast in 1853. Colloquially styled the 'Knez's arsenal', its first director, Charles Loubry, was a French engineer authorized to take over this duty by the Emperor of France, Napoleon III. [ 14 ] The Kragujevac cannon foundry in its working days as part of the VTZ Following the creation of the VTZ, industrial development continued at an unprecedented pace. The first telephone exchange was installed in 1858, and in 1868 the first industrial brewery was opened by Nikola Mesarović. The first printing press was founded in 1870. To connect the city's burgeoning military industry as well as its production of iron ploughs to the rest of Serbia's regions, the Belgrade – Niš railroad was built in 1886. To serve its industrial population, Serbia's first grammar school ( gimnazija) , the city's first pharmacy, and its first cinema, located in a local kafana , were all built during the remainder of the 19th century, along with Kragujevac's Great (or Upper) Park and, in 1891, its first regulatory urban plan. [ 6 ] [ 15 ] The city's industrialism characterized it among its European peers, along with its workers' demonstrations, known as the Crveni barjak ('Red banner') demonstrations, first held on 27 February 1876. [ 14 ] Today, the beginnings of the town's industry, the now-defunct VTZ, have been recognized by the Serbian government as vital to Serbia's cultural heritage and, as of 2017, consists of 151 individual objects, of which 31 are protected as unique heritage, including the old foundry, the machine workshop, the chimney, the fire lookout tower , the railroad bridge over the Lepenica River, and the cartridge factory. Once known by its non-industrial residents as the 'Forbidden City' ( Zabranjeni Grad), the complex is now open to the public. [ 14 ] World War I [ edit ] During World War I , Kragujevac again became the capital of Serbia (1914–1915), and the seat of many state institutions—the Supreme Army Command was housed within the courthouse building. [ 6 ] [ 16 ] A unit of the Scottish Women's Hospital for Women's Service was based there from  December 1914 to November 1915. A list of those working in the hospital can be viewed on the website "Imperial War Museum: Lives of the First World War " and more information on these units is below. [ 17 ] During the war, Kragujevac lost around 15% of its population. On the night of 2 June 1918, a group of occupying Slovak soldiers from the Austro-Hungarian 71st infantry regiment mutinied in the city centre. The soldiers, led by Viktor Kolibík, had recently returned from captivity in Russia and were to be immediately deployed to the Italian Front. The mutiny failed, and 44 mutineers were executed. [ 18 ] Yugoslavia [ edit ] Main articles: Kragujevac massacre and Zastava Automobiles Following World War I, Kragujevac became a part of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, later renamed the Kingdom of Yugoslavia . In the period before the Second World War, the city continued its cultural and economic development with the founding of the Gundulić Theatre and the Kragujevac Academic Theatre as well as a number of new factories. [ 19 ] King Peter's Street Following the Nazi invasion of Yugoslavia , the city came under direct Nazi occupation . After a joint Partisan - Chetnik attack on German forces in nearby Gornji Milanovac , Generalfeldmarschall Wilhelm Keitel calculated that 50 people were to be shot for every German soldier wounded and 100 people were to be shot for every German soldier killed. Franz Böhme therefore ordered the deaths of nearly 2,800 men and boys between 19 and 21 October 1941 in the Kragujevac massacre . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] The dead included a class from the city's First Gymnasium; today, a monument to the executed pupils is the symbol of the city. [ 22 ] The massacre inspired a poem titled Krvava Bajka ( A Bloody Fairy Tale ) by Desanka Maksimović . [ 23 ] The city was liberated from Nazi Germany on 21 October 1944. [ 6 ] In the post-war period, Kragujevac continued to develop its industry. Its main products were passenger cars, trucks and industrial vehicles, hunting arms, industrial chains, leather, and textiles. The biggest industry was Zastava Automobiles , which at one point employed tens of thousands people. [ 24 ] The first product of the Zastava Automobiles car company, the FIAT 750, was manufactured in 1955 under a licence to Fiat Automobiles (now Fiat Serbia) . In the following three decades, more than five million passenger cars (FIAT 750, Zastava 1300, Zastava 101, Zastava 128, Zastava Yugo, Yugo Florida, Fiat 500L ) were manufactured and marketed in 74 countries worldwide. [ 25 ] Perhaps most famous among the automobiles produced is the Yugo , also marketed as the Zastava Korral. The city's industry greatly suffered under international economic sanctions during the Milošević era in the 1990s, and some parts were reduced to rubble in the 1999 NATO bombing of FR Yugoslavia . [ 26 ] Kragujevac today [ edit ] The city today remains an industrial heart of Serbia, and has grown with the influx of students and refugees from the Yugoslav wars. In 2010, the city government signed a memorandum with the German development agency GIZ and in 2012 city hall adopted a strategy of urban development of the central city zone to be completed by 2030. As of December 2017, many objects within the complex deteriorated and the right bank of the Lepenica is urbanistically neglected. The authenticity and representative values of the complex must be preserved, but where it is allowed, the industrial and workers quarters will be transformed into the residential and commercial areas, traffic corridors and used for the numerous educational and cultural institutions Serbia's industrial city continues to cherish. [ 14 ] Geography and infrastructure [ edit ] Kragujevac lies 180 metres (591 feet) above sea level . [ 27 ] The coordinates of the city are 44°00'36.3 N and 20°55'01.9 E. It is located in the valley of the river Lepenica . The city covers an area of 835 square kilometres (322 sq mi), surrounded by the slopes of the Rudnik , Crni Vrh , and Gledić mountains . [ 27 ] Kragujevac is the traditional centre of Šumadija , a region characterized by its rolling hills and fertile orchards. [ 27 ] Kragujevac is centre of Šumadija region National Reserve Veliki Sturac, Mountain Rudnik Metino Brdo view Cityscape [ edit ] The architecture of Kragujevac displays a fusion of many different styles. Historically, Ottoman (nowadays almost completely gone) and 19th century Vienna Secession style architecture have played an important role in the city's landscape. [ 28 ] Newer architecture dominates the city's panorama. A blend of Viennese, Balkan as well as Brutalism is present, as showcased in the monuments to the Kragujevac massacre. [ 29 ] Post-war concrete apartment blocks built during the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia period are prominent. [ 29 ] Today, glass office buildings reflect the ambitious business aspirations of the city. Some important buildings in Kragujevac include: The "old" (or "Pridvorina") church of Descent of the Holy Spirit, built in 1818 as a part of Prince Miloš's court [ 30 ] The Old Parliament, built in the court of the church where the first parliamentary meeting was held in 1859 The Amidža Konak , built by Prince Miloš as a residential house (now exhibition) and an example of regional Serbian architecture [ 31 ] The Prince Mihailo Konak, built in 1860 to blend local tradition with European architectural concepts and now the National Museum The grammar school ( gimnazija ), built between 1885 and 1887 in European style to serve as the first educational institution of its kind in Serbia, educating prominent Serbian figures such as Svetozar Marković , Nikola Pašić , and Radomir Putnik The Upper (Great) Park is the largest park in Kragujevac. It was established in 1898. It is covered with more than 10 hectares (25 acres) of greenery, and a dense canopy of century-old trees, renovated walkways and benches are the right place for rest, walk and relaxation. In the park and its immediate vicinity there are sports facilities for basketball, football, volleyball, tennis, and indoor and outdoor swimming pools. [ 29 ] Lower (Small) Park is located in the city centre, within the Milos Wreath complex. At its centre there is a monument to the Fallen People of Šumadija . The Ilina Voda park, a legacy of Svetozar Andrejević, was established in 1900. It covers an area of 7 hectares (17 acres). There is a fountain with a small waterfall, five mini lakes connected by a small stream, and a small zoo with about 100 animals and a garden with various types of trees characteristic of Šumadija. The curiosity in the park is the largest sculpture of Easter eggs (3 metres (10 ft) high) in Europe and the second in the world ; made from recycled metal, set in 2004. [ 32 ] Scenic attractions nearby include the Aranđelovac , Gornji Milanovac , Vrnjačka Banja , and Mataruška Banja , Karađorđe's castle, the Church of Saint George in Topola 40 kilometres (25 miles) away, the Old Kalenić monastery 55 kilometres (34 miles) away, the resorts of Rogot (28 km (17 mi)) and Stragari (34 km (21 mi)) with the old Blagoveštenje and Voljavča monasteries. View of Kragujevac House of prince Mihailo Obrenović III Kragujevac Cathedral Pedestrian zone Amidžin Konak Transportation [ edit ] Kragujevac has developed transportation infrastructure, with a variety of road connections to the Serbian capital, Belgrade. It can be reached using Serbian IB-class roads 24 (an expressway) and 25. In the coming years, the city will also be accessible via Pan-European Corridor X or, in Serbia, the A1 motorway . The town is also connected to nearby Jagodina and Gornji Milanovac via class IIA road numbers 170 and 176 (via Bar, Montenegro), respectively. [ 33 ] Kragujevac is connected by bus lines with almost all cities in the country. The most frequent departures (every half-hour) are to Belgrade. The central bus station is about a kilometre away from the city centre. Kragujevac can also be reached by train. The central train station is located close to the central bus station. [ 34 ] The company responsible for public transportation in Kragujevac is the City Traffic Agency (GSA). The integrated public transport is performed by two companies: Arriva Litas and Vulović Transport. There are 22 urban bus lines and 14 lines that connect nearby rural areas operating according to established timetable. [ 35 ] There are also 7 taxi and 3 rent-a-car companies operating in Kragujevac.
