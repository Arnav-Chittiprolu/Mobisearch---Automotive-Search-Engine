It was formed as Mysore State on 1 November 1956, with the passage of the States Reorganisation Act , and renamed Karnataka in 1973. The state is bordered by the Lakshadweep Sea to the west, Goa to the northwest, Maharashtra to the north, Telangana to the northeast, Andhra Pradesh to the east, Tamil Nadu to the southeast, and Kerala to the southwest. With 61,130,704 inhabitants at the 2011 census, Karnataka is the eighth-largest state by population , comprising 31 districts . With 15,257,000 residents, the state capital Bengaluru is the largest city of Karnataka. [ 13 ] The economy of Karnataka is among the most productive in the country with a gross state domestic product (GSDP) of ₹ 25.01 trillion (US$300 billion) and a per capita GSDP of ₹ 332,926 (US$3,900) for the financial year 2023–24. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] The state experienced a GSDP growth of 10.2% for the same fiscal year. [ 14 ] After Bengaluru Urban , Dakshina Kannada , Hubli–Dharwad , and Belagavi districts contribute the highest revenue to the state respectively. The capital of the state, Bengaluru, is known as the Silicon Valley of India , for its immense contributions to the country's information technology sector. A total of 1,973 companies in the state were found to have been involved in the IT sector as of 2007. [ 16 ] Karnataka is the only southern state to have land borders with all of the other four southern Indian sister states. The state covers an area of 191,791 km 2 (74,051 mi 2 ), or 5.83 per cent of the total geographical area of India. [ 17 ] It is the sixth-largest Indian state by area . [ 17 ] Kannada , one of the classical languages of India , is the most widely spoken and official language of the state. Other minority languages spoken include Urdu , Konkani , Marathi , Tulu , Tamil , Telugu , Malayalam , Kodava and Beary . Karnataka also contains some of the only villages in India where Sanskrit is primarily spoken . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Though several etymologies have been suggested for the name Karnataka, the generally accepted one is that Karnataka is derived from the Kannada words karu and nādu , meaning "elevated land". Karu Nadu may also be read as karu , meaning "black" and nadu , meaning "region", as a reference to the black cotton soil found in the Bayalu Seeme region of the state. The British used the word Carnatic , sometimes Karnatak , to describe both sides of peninsular India, south of the Krishna . [ 21 ] With an antiquity that dates to the Paleolithic , Karnataka has been home to some of the most powerful empires of ancient and medieval India . The philosophers and musical bards patronised by these empires launched socio-religious and literary movements which have endured to the present day. Karnataka has contributed significantly to both forms of Indian classical music, the Carnatic and Hindustani traditions. Etymology Further information: Etymology of Karnataka History Main articles: History of Karnataka and Political history of medieval Karnataka For a chronological guide, see Timeline of Karnataka . Mallikarjuna temple and Kashi Vishwanatha temple at Pattadakal , built successively by the kings of the Chalukya Empire and Rashtrakuta Empire , is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Karnataka's pre-history goes back to a Paleolithic hand-axe culture evidenced by discoveries of, among other things, hand axes and cleavers in the region. [ 22 ] Evidence of Neolithic and megalithic cultures have also been found in the state. Gold discovered in Harappa was found to be imported from mines in Karnataka, prompting scholars to hypothesise about contacts between ancient Karnataka and the Indus Valley Civilisation c. 3300 BCE . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Prior to the third century BCE, most of Karnataka formed part of the Mauryan Empire of Emperor Ashoka . Four centuries of Satavahana rule followed, allowing them to control large areas of Karnataka. The decline of Satavahana power led to the rise of the earliest native kingdoms, the Kadambas and the Western Gangas , marking the region's emergence as an independent political entity. The Kadamba Dynasty , founded by Mayurasharma , had its capital at Banavasi ; [ 25 ] [ 26 ] the Western Ganga Dynasty was formed with Talakad as its capital. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] These were also the first kingdoms to use Kannada in administration, as evidenced by the Halmidi inscription and a fifth-century copper coin discovered at Banavasi. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] These dynasties were followed by imperial Kannada empires such as the Badami Chalukyas , [ 31 ] [ 32 ] the Rashtrakuta Empire [ 33 ] [ 34 ] and the Western Chalukya Empire , [ 35 ] [ 36 ] which ruled over large parts of the Deccan and had their capitals in what is now Karnataka. The Western Chalukyas patronised a unique style of architecture and Kannada literature which became a precursor to the Hoysala art of the 12th century. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Parts of modern-day Southern Karnataka (Gangavadi) were occupied by the Chola Empire at the turn of the 11th century. [ 39 ] The Cholas and the Hoysalas fought over the region in the early 12th century before it eventually came under Hoysala rule. [ 39 ] At the turn of the first millennium, the Hoysalas gained power in the region. Literature flourished during this time, which led to the emergence of distinctive Kannada literary metres , and the construction of temples and sculptures adhering to the Vesara style of architecture. [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] The expansion of the Hoysala Empire brought minor parts of modern Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu under its rule. In the early 14th century, Harihara and Bukka Raya established the Vijayanagara empire with its capital, Hosapattana (later named Vijayanagara ), on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in the modern Bellary district. Under the rule of Krishnadevaraya , a distinct form of literature and architecture evolved. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] The empire rose as a bulwark against Muslim advances into South India, which it completely controlled for over two centuries. [ 46 ] [ 47 ] In 1537, Kempe Gowda I , a chieftain of the Vijayanagara Empire , widely held as the founder of modern Bengaluru, built a fort and established the area around it as Bengaluru Pete . [ 48 ] In 1565, Karnataka and the rest of South India experienced a major geopolitical shift when the Vijayanagara empire fell to a confederation of Islamic sultanates in the Battle of Talikota . [ 49 ] The Bijapur Sultanate , which had risen after the demise of the Bahmani Sultanate of Bidar, soon took control of much of the Deccan; it was defeated by the Mughals in the late 17th century. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] The Bahmani and Bijapur rulers encouraged Urdu and Persian literature and Indo-Saracenic architecture, the Gol Gumbaz being one of the high points of this style. [ 52 ] During the sixteenth century, Konkani Hindus migrated to Karnataka, mostly from Salcette , Goa , [ 53 ] while during the seventeenth and eighteenth century, Goan Catholics migrated to North Canara and South Canara , especially from Bardes , Goa, as a result of food shortages, epidemics and heavy taxation imposed by the Portuguese . [ 54 ] In the period that followed, parts of northern Karnataka were ruled by the Nizam of Hyderabad , the Maratha Empire , the British , and other powers. [ 55 ] In the south, the Mysore Kingdom , a former vassal of the Vijayanagara Empire, was briefly independent. [ 56 ] With the death of Krishnaraja Wodeyar II , Haidar Ali , the commander-in-chief of the Mysore army, gained control of the region. After his death, the kingdom was inherited by his son Tipu Sultan . [ 57 ] To contain European expansion in South India, Hyder Ali and later Tipu Sultan fought four significant Anglo-Mysore Wars , the last of which resulted in Tippu Sultan's death and the incorporation of Mysore into British India in 1799. [ 58 ] Mysore was restored to the Wodeyars, and the Kingdom of Mysore became a princely state outside but in a subsidiary alliance with British India . [ 57 ] Chief Minister Devaraj Urs announcing the new name of the Mysore state as 'Karnataka' As the " doctrine of lapse " gave way to dissent and resistance from princely states across the country, Kittur Chennamma , Queen of Kittur , her military leader Sangolli Rayanna , and others, spearheaded rebellions in part of what is now Karnataka in 1830, nearly three decades before the Indian Rebellion of 1857 . However, Kitturu was taken over by the British East India Company even before the doctrine was officially articulated by Lord Dalhousie in 1848. [ 59 ] Other uprisings followed, such as the ones at Supa , Bagalkot , Shorapur , Nargund and Dandeli . These rebellions—which coincided with the Indian Rebellion of 1857 —were led by Mundargi Bhimarao, Bhaskar Rao Bhave , the Halagali Bedas, Raja Venkatappa Nayaka and others. By the late 19th century, the independence movement had gained momentum; Karnad Sadashiva Rao, Aluru Venkata Raya , S. Nijalingappa , Kengal Hanumanthaiah , Nittoor Srinivasa Rau and others carried on the struggle into the early 20th century. [ 60 ] After the independence of British India , the Maharaja, Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar , signed an instrument of accession to accede his state to the new India. In 1950, Mysore became an Indian state of the same name; the former Maharaja served as its Rajpramukh (head of state) until 1975. Following the long-standing demand of the Ekikarana Movement , Kodagu- and Kannada-speaking regions from the adjoining states of Madras, Hyderabad and Bombay were incorporated into the Mysore state, under the States Reorganisation Act of 1956. The thus expanded state was renamed Karnataka, seventeen years later, on 1 November 1973. [ 61 ] In the early 1900s through the post-independence era, industrial visionaries such as Sir Mokshagundam Visvesvarayya , played an important role in the development of Karnataka's strong manufacturing and industrial base. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Geography Main articles: Geography of Karnataka , Rainfall in Karnataka , and List of beaches in Karnataka The state has three principal geographical zones: Jog Falls , formed by Sharavathi River, are the second-highest plunge waterfalls in India. The coastal region of Karavali and Tulu Nadu The hilly Malenadu region comprising the Western Ghats The Bayaluseeme region comprising the plains of the Deccan Plateau The bulk of the state is in the Bayaluseeme region, the northern part of which is the second-largest arid region in India. [ 64 ] The highest point in Karnataka is the Mullayanagiri hills in Chikmagalur district which has an altitude of 1,925 m (6,316 ft). The two main river systems of the state are the Krishna and its tributaries, the Bhima , Ghataprabha , Vedavathi , Malaprabha and Tungabhadra in North Karnataka, and the Kaveri and its tributaries, the Hemavati , Shimsha , Arkavati , Lakshmana Thirtha and Kabini , in South Karnataka. Most of these rivers flow out of Karnataka eastward, reaching the sea at the Bay of Bengal . Other prominent rivers such as the Sharavati in Shimoga and Netravati in Dakshina Kannada flow westward to the Lakshadweep Sea . A large number of dams and reservoirs are constructed across these rivers which richly add to the irrigation and hydroelectricity power generation capacities of the state. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] Karnataka consists of four main types of geological formations [ 67 ] – the Archean complex made up of Dharwad schists and granitic gneisses , [ 68 ] the Proterozoic non-fossiliferous sedimentary formations of the Kaladgi and Bhima series, [ 69 ] the Deccan trappean and intertrappean deposits and the tertiary and recent laterites and alluvial deposits. [ 70 ] Laterite cappings that are found in many districts over the Deccan Traps were formed after the cessation of volcanic activity in the early tertiary period. Eleven groups of soil orders are found in Karnataka, viz. Entisols , Inceptisols , Mollisols , Spodosols , Alfisols , Ultisols , Oxisols , Aridisols , Vertisols , Andisols and Histosols . [ 67 ] [ 71 ] Depending on the agricultural capability of the soil, the soil types are divided into six types, viz. red, lateritic , black , alluvio-colluvial, forest and coastal soils. [ 71 ] About 38,284 km 2 (14,782 sq mi) of Karnataka (i.e. 16% of the state's geographic area) is covered by forests. [ 72 ] [ 73 ] The forests are classified as reserved, protected, unclosed, village and private forests. [ 72 ] The percentage of forested area is slightly less than the all-India average of about 23%, [ 72 ] and significantly less than the 33% prescribed in the National Forest Policy. [ 74 ] Climate Karnataka experiences four seasons. The winter in January and February is followed by summer between March and May, the monsoon season between June and September and the post-monsoon season from October till December. Meteorologically , Karnataka is divided into three zones – coastal, north interior and south interior. Of these, the coastal zone receives the heaviest rainfall with an average rainfall of about 3,638.5 mm (143 in) per annum, far in excess of the state average of 1,139 mm (45 in). Amagaon in Khanapura taluka of Belgaum district received 10,068 mm (396 in) of rainfall in 2010. [ 75 ] In 2014 Kokalli in Sirsi taluka of Uttara Kannada district received 8,746 mm (344 in) of rainfall. [ 76 ] Agumbe in Thirthahalli taluka and Hulikal of Hosanagara taluka in Shimoga district were the rainiest cities in Karnataka, situated in one of the wettest regions in the world. [ 77 ] The state is projected to warm about 2.0 °C (4 °F ) by 2030. The monsoon is set to provide less rainfall. Agriculture in Karnataka is mostly rainfed as opposed to irrigated, making it highly vulnerable to expected changes in the monsoon. [ 78 ] The highest recorded temperature was 45.6 °C (114 °F ) in Raichuru district . The lowest recorded temperature was 2.8 °C (37 °F) at Bidar district . [ 79 ] Flora and fauna Main article: Wildlife of Karnataka The state bird, Indian roller Bengal tigers at Bannerghatta National Park near Bengaluru Karnataka is home to a variety of wildlife. It has a recorded forest area of 38,720 km 2 (14,950 sq mi) which constitutes 12.3% of the total geographical area of the state. [ 80 ] These forests support 25% of the Indian elephant and 10% of the tiger population of India. Many regions of Karnataka are as yet unexplored, so new species of flora and fauna are found periodically. The Western Ghats , a biodiversity hotspot , includes the western region of Karnataka. Bandipur and Nagarhole National Parks were included in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve in 1986, a UNESCO designation. [ 81 ] The Indian roller and the Indian elephant are recognised as the state bird and animal while sandalwood and the lotus are recognised as the state tree and flower respectively. Karnataka has five national parks: Anshi , Bandipur , Bannerghatta , Kudremukh and Nagarhole. [ 82 ] It also has 27 wildlife sanctuaries of which seven are bird sanctuaries. [ 83 ] [ 80 ] Wild animals in Karnataka include the Indian elephant, tiger, leopard , gaur , sambar deer , chital , Indian muntjac , bonnet macaque , slender loris , Asian palm civet , small Indian civet , sloth bear , dhole , striped hyena , Bengal fox and golden jackal . Some of the birds present include the great hornbill , Malabar pied hornbill , Ceylon frogmouth , herons, ducks, kites, eagles, falcons , quails , partridges , lapwings , sandpipers , pigeons, doves, parakeets , cuckoos, owls, nightjars , swifts , kingfishers , bee-eaters and munias . [ 82 ] [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Some species of trees are Calophyllum tomentosum , Calophyllum apetalum , Garcinia cambogia , Garcinia morella , Alstonia scholaris , Flacourtia montana , Artocarpus hirsutus , Artocarpus lacucha , Cinnamomum zeylanicum , Grewia tiliifolia , Santalum album , Shorea talura , Emblica officinalis , Vitex altissima and Wrightia tinctoria . Wildlife in Karnataka is threatened by poaching , habitat destruction , human-wildlife conflict and pollution . [ 82 ] Sub-divisions Political map of Indian state of Karnataka with the official names of its 31 districts. Main article: List of districts of Karnataka There are 31 districts in Karnataka. Each district (zila) is administered by a Deputy Commissioner (also known as the District Collector ), who is typically an officer of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS). The districts are further divided into revenue sub-divisions, which are administered by assistant commissioners. These sub-divisions are further divided into taluks (or talukas), which are administered by Tahsildars . Taluks comprise hoblis (clusters of adjoining villages), which include revenue villages. Karnataka has around 6,022 Gram Panchayats, 226 Taluk Panchayats, and 31 Zilla Panchayats in rural areas.
In urban areas, there are 318 urban local bodies, including 1 BBMP , 13 Municipal Corporations, 60 City Municipal Councils, 126 Town Municipal Councils, 114 Town Panchayats and 4 notified area committees.

This represents a 15.60% increase over the population in 2001. The population density was 319 per km 2 and 38.67% of the people lived in urban areas. The literacy rate was 75.36% with 82.47% of males and 68.08% of females being literate. [ 90 ] In 2007 the state had a birth rate of 2.2%, a death rate of 0.7%, an infant mortality rate of 5.5% and a maternal mortality rate of 0.2%. The total fertility rate was 2.2. [ 91 ] Karnataka's private sector speciality health care competes with the best in the world. [ 92 ] [ 93 ] Karnataka has also established a modicum of public health services having a better record of health care and child care than most other states of India. In spite of these advances, some parts of the state still suffer from the lack of primary health care. [ 94 ] Karnataka ranked tenth in the Fiscal Health Index (FHI) 2025, with a score of 40.8. [ 95 ] Religion Main article: Religion in Karnataka Religion in Karnataka (2011) [ 96 ] Hinduism (84.0%) Islam (12.9%) Christianity (1.87%) Jainism (0.72%) Buddhism (0.16%) Sikhism (0.05%) Other (0.02%) Not religious (0.27%) Vishnu image inside the Badami Cave Temple Complex number 3. The complex is an example of Indian rock-cut architecture . Gomateswara (982–983) at Shravanabelagola is an important centre of Jain pilgrimage. Adi Shankara (788–820 CE) chose Sringeri in Karnataka to establish the first of his four mathas (monastery). Madhvacharya (1238–1317) was the chief proponent of Tattvavada (philosophy of reality), popularly known as Dvaita or Dualistic school of Hindu philosophy – one of the three most influential Vedanta philosophies. Madhvacharya was one of the important philosophers during the Bhakti movement . He was a pioneer in many ways, going against standard conventions and norms. According to tradition, Madhvacharya is believed to be the third incarnation of Vayu (Mukhyaprana), after Hanuman and Bhima . The Haridasa devotional movement is considered one of the turning points in the cultural history of India. Over a span of nearly six centuries, several saints and mystics helped shape the culture, philosophy, and art of South India and Karnataka in particular by exerting considerable spiritual influence over the masses and kingdoms that ruled South India. [ citation needed ] This movement was ushered in by the Haridasas (literally "servants of Hari") and took shape in the 13th century – 14th century CE, period, prior to and during the early rule of the Vijayanagara empire. The main objective of this movement was to propagate the Dvaita philosophy of Madhvacharya (Madhva Siddhanta) to the masses through a literary medium known as Dasa Sahitya . Purandara Dasa is widely recognised as the "Pithamaha" of Carnatic Music for his immense contribution. Ramanuja , the leading expounder of Vishishtadvaita , spent many years in Melkote . He came to Karnataka in 1098 CE and lived here until 1122 CE. He first lived in Tondanur and then moved to Melkote where the Cheluvanarayana Swamy Temple and a well-organised matha were built. He was patronised by the Hoysala king, Vishnuvardhana . [ 97 ] In the twelfth century, Lingayatism emerged in northern Karnataka as a protest against the rigidity of the prevailing social and caste system. Leading figures of this movement were Basava , Akka Mahadevi and Allama Prabhu , who established the Anubhava Mantapa which was the centre of all religious and philosophical thoughts and discussions pertaining to Lingayats. These three social reformers did so by the literary means of "Vachana Sahitya" which is very famous for its simple, straight forward and easily understandable Kannada language. Lingayatism preached women equality by letting women wear Ishtalinga i.e. Symbol of god around their neck. Basava shunned the sharp hierarchical divisions that existed and sought to remove all distinctions between the hierarchically superior master class and the subordinate, servile class. He also supported inter-caste marriages and Kaay Ta tTatva of Basavanna. This was the basis of the Lingayat faith which today counts millions among its followers. [ 98 ] The Jain philosophy and literature have contributed immensely to the religious and cultural landscape of Karnataka. [ citation needed ] Islam , which had an early presence on the west coast of India as early as the tenth century, gained a foothold in Karnataka with the rise of the Bahamani and Bijapur sultanates that ruled parts of Karnataka. [ 99 ] Christianity reached Karnataka in the sixteenth century with the arrival of the Portuguese and St. Francis Xavier in 1545. [ 100 ] Buddhism was popular in Karnataka during the first millennium in places such as Gulbarga and Banavasi . A chance discovery of edicts and several Mauryan relics at Sannati in Kalaburagi district in 1986 has proven that the Krishna River basin was once home to both Mahayana and Hinayana Buddhism. There are Tibetan refugee camps in Karnataka. [ citation needed ] Festivals Mysore Dasara is celebrated as the Nada habba (state festival) and this is marked by major festivities at Mysore. Bengaluru Karaga , celebrated in the heart of Bengaluru, is the second most important festival celebrated in Karnataka. [ 101 ] Ugadi (Kannada New Year), Makara Sankranti (the harvest festival), Ganesh Chaturthi , Gowri Habba , Ram Navami , Nagapanchami , Basava Jayanthi , Deepavali , and Balipadyami are the other major festivals of Karnataka.

Languages of Karnataka ( 2011 census ) [ 102 ] Kannada (66.5%) Urdu (10.8%) Telugu (5.84%) Tamil (3.45%) Marathi (3.29%) Tulu (2.61%) Lambadi (1.59%) Hindi (1.43%) Konkani (1.29%) Malayalam (1.22%) Others (1.99%) Kannada is the official language of the state of Karnataka, as the native language of 66.46% of its population as of 2011 and is one of the classical languages of India . Urdu is the second largest language, spoken by 10.83% of the population, and is the language of Muslims outside the coastal region. Telugu (5.84%) is a major language in areas bordering Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka as well as Bengaluru, while Tamil (3.45%) is a major language of Bengaluru and in the Kolar district. Marathi (3.29%) is concentrated in areas of Uttara Kannada, Belgaum and Bidar districts bordering Maharashtra. Lambadi is spoken by the Lambadis scattered throughout North Karnataka, while Hindi is spoken in Bengaluru. Tulu (2.61%), Konkani (1.29%), and Malayalam (1.27%) are all found in linguistically diverse Coastal Karnataka, where a number of mixed and distinct dialects such as Are Bhashe , Beary Bhashe , and Nawayathi are found. Kodava Takk is the language of Kodagu. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] [ 104 ] Kannada played a crucial role in the creation of Karnataka: linguistic demographics played a major role in defining the new state in 1956. Tulu , Konkani and Kodava are other minor native languages that share a long history in the state. Urdu is spoken widely by the Muslim population. Less widely spoken languages include Beary bashe and certain languages such as Sankethi . Some of the regional languages in Karnataka are Tulu , Kodava , Konkani and Beary . [ 105 ] [ 106 ] [ 107 ] Kannada features a rich and ancient body of literature including religious and secular genre, covering topics as diverse as Jainism (such as Puranas ), Lingayatism (such as Vachanas ), Vaishnavism (such as Haridasa Sahitya ) and modern literature . Evidence from edicts during the time of Ashoka (reigned 274–232 BCE) suggest that Buddhist literature influenced the Kannada script and its literature. The Halmidi inscription , the earliest attested full-length inscription in the Kannada language and script, dates from 450 CE, while the earliest available literary work, the Kavirajamarga , has been dated to 850 CE.
