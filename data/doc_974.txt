From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Concept car developed by Nissan Motor vehicle Nissan Nails Overview Manufacturer Nissan Production 2001 Body and chassis Class Concept car Body style 2-door pickup Layout FF layout Powertrain Engine 1.5 L QG15DE I4 Transmission 4-speed automatic Dimensions Length 167 in (4,242 mm) The Nissan Nails is a concept pickup truck built by Nissan . It was introduced in 2001 at the Tokyo Auto Show . [ 1 ] Specifications [ edit ] The Nails is powered by a front-mounted 1.5 L QG15DE inline-four engine producing around 100 hp (75 kW; 101 PS), paired to a 4-speed automatic transmission, with power sent to the front wheels. It features a 2-door, 2-seater pickup body style with matte blue and black body panels that Nissan claims are manufactured to be dent and scratch resistant. [ 2 ] The load bed of the Nails is placed lower than most contemporary pickup trucks, sitting at around the centerline of the rear wheels, allowing for a low, flat load floor, which makes it easier to load in heavy objects. [ 3 ] The sides of the bed are two horizontal rails, connected to the wheelwells, instead of a solid bedside. It also features an upwards opening tailgate hinged at the left, and a "soft partition" between the bed and cabin, which could be rolled up to create a larger bed area. On the interior, the Nails features a multifunction screen in front of the driver and "integrated communications" tools, such as cellular phone integration. [ 4 ] It also features a single slatted bench seat, with alternating slats so the passenger seat can be pushed into the driver seat and free up space in the cabin for larger objects.
