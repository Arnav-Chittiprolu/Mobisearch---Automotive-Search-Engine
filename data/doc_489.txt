From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Compact executive car Motor vehicle Audi A5 Audi A5 B10, 2024 Overview Manufacturer Audi AG Production 2007–present Body and chassis Class Compact executive car ( D ) Grand tourer ( S ) (2007–2024) Layout Front-engine, front-wheel-drive / all-wheel-drive ( quattro ) Related Audi A4 The Audi A5 is a series of compact executive and grand touring coupé cars produced by the German automobile manufacturer Audi since June 2007. The A5 range also includes the coupe, cabriolet , and "Sportback"—a five-door liftback with a fastback roofline—derived from the Audi A4 saloon and estate models. Under Audi's internal platform numbering convention, the A5 is a member of the B-platform series of vehicles, sharing its platform designation with the A4 saloon and Avant . The first generation A5 ( Type 8T ) belongs to the B8 family, while the second-generation model ( Type 8W6 ) is based on the B9 . [ 1 ] Both generations are derived from the Volkswagen MLB (Modular Longitudinal Matrix) architecture.

On May 10, 2006, Audi confirmed that the A5 would go into production. The B6/B7 A4 included a convertible variant but no coupé. For the fourth-generation A4 (B8), Audi decided to spin off the cabriolet , along with a new coupé and four-door fastback sedan, into a distinct nameplate as the A5. The A5 was the first vehicle in the B8 family to be released (the others being the A4 and the Q5 crossover SUV), all of which were based on the Audi MLP (Modular Longitudinal Platform). This platform underpins the next-generation A6 and A8 . [ 4 ] The A5 is the third coupé in Audi's lineup, following the second-generation TT and the R8 . It adopted design elements from the Nuvolari quattro concept car and debuted with a 3.2-litre FSI V6 engine , delivering 195 kW (265 PS; 261 hp). Coupé (8T3) [ edit ] The A5 and S5 design was based on the Nuvolari quattro concept car. The A5 and the S5 Coupé were unveiled simultaneously at the Salon International de l'Auto ( Geneva ) [ 5 ] and the Melbourne International Motor Shows on 6 March 2007. Orders for the A5 and S5 began the same day as their unveiling, 6 March 2007; the first deliveries were made in June 2007. [ 6 ] Launch models included the 3.2-litre FSI V6 engine multitronic and the 3.0-litre TDI quattro 6-speed, [ 7 ] with the 1.8-litre TFSI available in late 2007. Early U.S. models included the A5 3.2-litre FSI quattro and the S5 coupé 4.2-litre FSI quattro. Both included either a six-speed manual or a six-speed Tiptronic automatic transmission . The S5 model went on sale in November 2007, initially equipped only with a manual transmission, while the A5 with Tiptronic became available in early 2008. [ 8 ] The A5 went on sale in Canada in 2008, featuring the A5 3.2-litre FSI with a choice of a six-speed manual or six-speed Tiptronic transmission. Since 2011, only the 2.0-litre turbo engines have been available for the A5 in Canada. [ 9 ] In 2013, Audi introduced the A5 Black Edition . Cabriolet (8F) [ edit ] Production of both the Audi A5 and the S5 Cabriolet (convertible) began in early 2009. The A5 Cabriolet included a fabric roof as opposed to the retractable hardtop used on the Volkswagen Eos . The engine range was the same as contemporary A5 coupé models, but the S5 Cabriolet featured a 3.0 TFSI V6 supercharged engine. [ 10 ] The A5 Cabriolet replaced the A4 Cabriolet. [ 11 ] Deliveries of the A5 Cabriolet began in the second quarter of 2009. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 New York Auto Show . [ 12 ] The U.S. versions of the A5 and S5 Cabriolet went on sale in September 2009 as 2010 models. Early models included the A5 2.0-litre I4 TFSI Multitronic, A5 2.0-litre quattro Tiptronic, and S5 quattro S-Tronic. [ 13 ] Sportback (8T8) [ edit ] The A5 Sportback has four frameless doors and a long, tapering fastback -like roofline, giving it a 'four-door coupé-like' appearance. While it shares many exterior design cues with the A5 coupé, the Sportback's interior is similar to that of the A4 saloon. Although all A5 models share the same platform as the A4, the Sportback is closer in design to the A4 than to the rest of the A5 family. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] The Sportback has been described as 'a saloon with the front end (including an identical S-line look) and taillights of the A5 coupé but the wheelbase of the A4,' with the Sportback positioned more as a 'designer's car' compared to the more conventional A4 saloon. [ 16 ] The Sportback model is available in Europe, Japan, South Korea, China, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, Mexico, Argentina, and South Africa. Although not originally sold in the United States and Canada, [ 17 ] the A5 Sportback entered the North American market as a 2018 model at the beginning of 2017. [ 18 ] Early production models included the 2.0-litre TFSI quattro 155 kW (211 PS; 208 hp), 3.2-litre FSI quattro, 2.0-litre TDI 125 kW (170 PS; 168 hp) with a six-speed manual gearbox and start/stop system, 2.7-litre TDI, and the 3.0-litre TDI quattro. Production versions went on sale in September 2009. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] The A5 Sportback is available with two petrol engines and three diesel engines. S5 (2007) [ edit ] See also: Audi S5 Audi S5 Coupé (8T3, Germany) Audi S5 Cabriolet (8F7, Australia) The Audi S5 was released in coupé form to the public at the same time as the A5. The Audi S5, in comparison to the A5, features a different fascia (as do most Audi S and RS models ), including a string of LED daytime running lights around the bi-Xenon headlamps and a vertically striped chrome grille. In many markets, the S5 includes as standard, 19-inch alloy wheels with a five parallel spoke design, bigger brakes, heated leather sport seats, and other convenience features, some of which are available only as an option on the A5. Changes for the 2010 model year include LED tail lamps, the introduction of Premium Plus and Prestige trim levels, and new optional equipment such as Leather/Alcantara seats. Despite sharing the same nameplate, the powertrains were different between the coupé and the Cabriolet/Sportback for the 2010–12 model years. The 2010–12 Audi S5 coupé had a 4.2 litre fuel stratified injection (FSI) V8 engine [ 4 ] that produces 260 kW (349 hp), while the S5 Cabriolet and Sportback have a supercharged 3.0 litre TFSI V6 engine producing 245 kW (329 hp) which is shared with the 2010 Audi S4 3.0 TFSI quattro sedan and avant. The coupé had a choice of either a six speed manual or six speed Tiptronic automatic, while the Cabriolet/Sportback has the seven speed S-tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. [ 22 ] Aluminium A5 Coupé [ edit ] The Aluminium A5 Coupé is a prototype vehicle demonstrating the aluminium Audi Space Frame (ASF) concept. It is based on Audi A5 Coupé 2.0 TFSI with 155 kW (211 PS; 208 hp) engine, but it uses the aluminium Audi Space Frame, aluminium and carbon fibre-reinforced plastics body. Punch riveting, bonding or laser-MIG hybrid welding replaced spot welding. The vehicle is 110 kg (243 lb) lighter than the equivalent steel-bodied production model. The vehicle was built by Audi's Aluminium and Lightweight Design Centre in Neckarsulm. [ 23 ] RS5 (2010) [ edit ] Audi RS5 coupe Audi RS5 coupe Available in coupé body, the RS5 features a 4.2 FSI engine rated at 450 PS (331 kW; 444 hp) at 8250 rpm and 430 N⋅m (317.15 lb⋅ft) at 4000-6000 rpm, [ 24 ] coupled with a seven-speed S-Tronic transmission and quattro permanent all-wheel-drive with crown-gear centre differential and electronic torque vectoring. It has 19 inch alloy wheels in an exclusive five arm structure design with 275/35 tires (optional 19 inch winter wheels), 365 mm (14.37 in) diameter ventilated aluminium front brake discs (optional 380 mm (14.96 in) diameter carbon ceramic front brake discs), aluminium 8 piston brake calipers from the Audi R8, painted RS logos in high-gloss black, electronic stabilization program with integrated sport mode, speed dependent servotronic steering, Audi drive select with three (4 with MMI navigation system) modes of operation (comfort, auto, and dynamic, optional custom), and optional dynamic steering. Aesthetically, the RS5 features a single-frame grille with a shiny charcoal grey rhombus pattern grid, Xenon plus headlights with a sweeping strip of LED daytime running lights, redesigned bumper tapers downward into a splitter, flared fenders inspired by Audi Quattro, side sills with angular caps, trim strips with aluminium look on the single-frame grille and near the side windows and the outside mirrors; a choice of eight body colours, two oval exhaust pipes integrated within the bumper, spoiler in the tailgate automatically extends at 120 km/h (75 mph) and retracts at 80 km/h (50 mph), [ 25 ] extensively clad underbody integrating air vents for the seven-speed S-Tronic and the front brakes. In the cockpit, the model has electrically adjustable sports seats in leather/Alcantara combination upholstery with side sections and integrated head restraints (optional bucket seats with more prominent contours and folding backrests, ventilated and luxuriously upholstered climate-controlled comfort seats; optional seat upholstery featuring special leathers and colours as well as silver headlining), steering wheel upholstered in perforated leather, black gauges with white lettering and distinctive scaling, driver information system with integrated lap timer and an oil temperature gauge, black interior with decorative inlays made of carbon fibre (optional dark stainless-steel mesh, black piano finish or brushed aluminium inlay), instrument panel fascia in piano finish, pedals, footrests, optional MMI navigation systems' control buttons in aluminium; door handles with two slim strips, aluminium inserts at door sill trims and RS 5 logos, optional suede-covered controls and floor mats bearing RS 5 logos, sport exhaust system with a sound flap and black tailpipe trims. A Carbon design package is available for the engine compartment and for the vehicle body. Styling packages include a black or matte aluminium look. The RS5 weighs 1,800 kg (3,968 lb), with 56.3 percent at the front and 43.7 in the rear, Audi has added two electro-mechanical systems which ensure the care is neutral in corners. The stability-control system attempts to stop front-end plow before it happens by squeezing the brakes on the inside wheels which effectively drag those tires enough to pull the car into the corner. The RS5 also has an active rear differential that can apportion power between the rear wheels to create a similar effect or even oversteer; in normal conditions, Quattro all-wheel-drive delivers 60% of the engine's torque rearward and rising to as much as 85 percent depending on conditions. [ 26 ] Road and Track’s Randy Pobst stated it handled better than the R8. Stephen Reil has noted that it was tested over 10k miles on the Nurburgring with input on suspension from the companies Le Mans winning race drivers. According to Quattro GmbH chief Stephan Reil, the 4.2 FSI engine is closest related to Audi's 5.2 FSI V10 engine found in the second generation Audi R8 and Lamborghini Hurrican. It features the same quasi-dry sump high G lubrication system found in the Audi R8 GT3 LMS and represents the best, most reliable, and most efficient naturally aspirated V8 engine that Audi engineers could create as the company knew it would be all turbo powered moving forward. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The vehicle was unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show . Sales of the Audi RS5 began in early 2010. [ 29 ] Ethanol E100 Coupé [ edit ] The Ethanol E100 Coupé is a prototype designed for the Michelin Challenge Bibendum 2010 series. It includes a 2.0 TFSI engine rated 132 kW (179 PS; 177 hp) and 320 N⋅m (236 lbf⋅ft) torque, six-gear manual quattro drivetrain. It accelerates from 0–100 kilometres per hour (0–62 mph) in 6.9 seconds with top speed of 236 km/h (147 mph), and weighs 1,310 kg (2,888 lb). The car officially consumes 9.9 litres per 100 kilometres (29 mpg ‑imp ; 24 mpg ‑US ) when running on ethanol, but drivers managed 9.5 L/100 km (30 mpg ‑imp ; 25 mpg ‑US ) on ethanol during the Michelin Challenge Bibendum Rallye. [ 30 ] S5 Special Edition [ edit ] The S5 Special Edition is a limited (125 units) version of the 2012 S5 4.2 FSI Quattro Coupé for the U.S. market, commemorating the end of Audi S5 4.2 FSI Quattro production. It included Prestige Package, Daytona Grey body colour, 19-inch 5-spoke Rotor design wheels, a two-tone Polar Silver and Black S5 sport seats, silver contrast stitching on the seats, armrests, shifter and steering wheel; floor mats with a silver leather border, aluminium 'Audi exclusive' badges on door panels, carbon fibre beltline and a piano black instrument cluster. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] The vehicle was unveiled in 2012 Audi Club North America meeting at Infineon Raceway.

The RS5 has a naturally aspirated 4.2 V8 that produces 444 hp (331 kW). [ 47 ] Deliveries of the RS5 Cabriolet began in early 2013, [ 48 ] [ 49 ] and went on sale in the US in April 2013. [ 50 ] A5 DTM [ edit ] Main article: Audi A5 DTM Codenamed R17, the Audi A5 DTM is a race car designed for the DTM beginning in year 2012, replacing the Audi A4 DTM. [ 51 ] It includes a V8 engine rated at 340 kW (462 PS; 456 hp) with a new 6-speed sequential semi-automatic transmission, pneumatically operated suspension using paddle-shifters on the steering wheel, engine electronics (Bosch MS 5.1) and the central display from Audi R8 LMS, larger and wider tires from Hankook, 120- litre (26 imp gal ; 32 US gal ) safety fuel tank inside a carbon fibre cell, and a larger rear wing. The prototype was built by Audi Sport in Ingolstadt. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2011 International Motor Show (IAA) in Frankfurt . [ 52 ] The homologation of the A5 DTM was scheduled for 1 March 2012. Marketing [ edit ] The 'ugly duckling' used in The Swan television advert As part of the 2012 A5 launch in the United Kingdom, BBH London, Park Pictures, The Whitehouse and The Mill produced a television advert titled 'The Swan' (directed by Joachim Back), inspired by Hans Christian Andersen's tale of 'The Ugly Duckling'. The commercial featured black and white shots of the rebodied 1920 Audi concept car designed by Audi engineer Paul Jaray, trawling the streets of a sleepy Bavarian village, the streamlined model gets shunned by disapproving locals not taking too well to the new aerodynamic design. After retiring in a nearby forest, the 'ugly' car transforms into the new Audi A5, metaphorically becoming the 'beautiful' white swan. The soundtrack features Danny Kaye singing the children's classic Ugly Duckling. [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] 2013 update [ edit ] A5 (2013) [ edit ] Changes to the Audi A5 Sportback include forced induction and direct injection on all engine models, standard start-stop-system; optional sport differential on the 3.0 TDI Quattro, and 3.0 TFSI Quattro, optional MMI navigation plus. Changes to A5 Cabriolet include optional neck-level heating, special coating for optional leather seats. S5 (2013) [ edit ] Available in Sportback, Coupé, Cabriolet bodies, it includes 3.0 TFSI engine rated 333 PS (245 kW; 328 hp) and 440 N⋅m (325 ft⋅lbf), seven-speed S-Tronic transmission, S sport suspension, electronically controlled shock absorbers, dynamic steering, optional Audi drive select, 18-inch aluminium wheels. [ 57 ] RS 5 Coupé, RS 5 Cabriolet [ edit ] Available in Coupé and Cabriolet bodies, it is a version of A5 with 4.2 FSI engine rated at 450 PS (331 kW; 444 hp) and 500 N⋅m (369 ft⋅lbf), seven-speed S-Tronic transmission, quattro permanent all-wheel drive system with crown-gear centre differential and torque vectoring (optional quattro with sport differential rear axle), 20 mm (0.79 in) lower body, electromechanical power steering, exclusive 19-inch forged alloy wheels, optional carbon fibre-ceramic brake discs, Audi drive select dynamics system, optional RS sport suspension with Dynamic Ride Control (DRC). [ 58 ] Litigation [ edit ] Audi had problems with the oil consumption in the engines of the models between 2009 and 2011. [ 59 ] More than 200 car owners in Switzerland were affected as well. [ 60 ] In Switzerland, cars with less than 100,000 kilometres (62,000 mi) and below five years old can have the hardware replaced and paid for by Audi. If the car is between 100,000 and 200,000 kilometres (62,000 and 124,000 mi) and below five years, Audi fully pays the hardware but only half of the work.

[ 74 ] [ 75 ] A coupé or convertible models are no longer offered for the third generation line-up. The saloon is equipped with a liftback and thus replaces both the A4 saloon and the A5 Sportback of the previous generation. The 'Avant' estate is still available. [ 76 ] The A5 became available to order in July 2024, with deliveries beginning in European countries in November 2024. [ 77 ] The A5 B10 is the first model based on the Premium Platform Combustion (PPC) . Like all other vehicles based on the PPC and PPE , it uses the E 3 1.2 software platform developed by Volkswagen subsidiary Cariad. [ 78 ] The liftback model has styling cues of a coupé with a sloped roofline and the tailgate design evokes the brand's Sportback models. The Avant model has a roofline which merges into the integrated roof spoiler that extends into the rear window and the raked D-pillars. The front has a wide single-frame grille with a 3D honeycomb structure, derived from Audi Sport. On the side, there are marked wheel arches which evoke the Quattro all-wheel drive system and are inspired by the Audi Ur-four . [ 79 ] The rear features a light bar that seamlessly connects the light clusters and the bottom part has rectangular exhaust pipes [ 77 ] [ 80 ] For exterior lighting, the headlights features LED daytime running lights, and the rear lights feature Audi's second generation of OLED technology. The OLED rear light clusters are also used as communication lighting by enabling Car-to-X interaction and alert road users behind. The front and rear lights have dynamic lighting effects when unlocking and leaving the vehicle and optional digital lighting signatures. [ 74 ] [ 77 ] According to Audi, the interior design of the A5 is based on four key characteristics: a 'human-centric' design, a 'Digital Stage', 'Material Driven Design', and 'Visual Clarity'. The Audi MMI panoramic display has a curved design and uses OLED technology. It consists of the 11.9-inch Audi virtual cockpit digital gauge cluster, the 14.5-inch MMI touchscreen infotainment system, and the optional 10.9-inch MMI front passenger display. The A5 is available with a configurable head-up display; and, for the first time, drivers have the option to control the infotainment and other vehicle functions via the heads-up display. [ 77 ] A5L and A5L Sportback [ edit ] The A5L is a China-exclusive long wheelbase sedan model, which was revealed at Auto Guangzhou 2024 by FAW-Audi on 15 November 2024. It has a notchback style rear-end, and has a length of 4,902 mm (193.0 in) and a wheelbase of 2,965 mm (116.7 in), increases of 73 mm (2.9 in) and 65 mm (2.6 in) over the standard model, respectively. [ 81 ] The A5L Sportback was released on 23 April 2025 by SAIC-Audi at Auto Shanghai 2025 , with preorders opening on 3 July and deliveries beginning on 1 August 2025. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] It maintains the standard version's coupe shape, and has a width of 1,883 mm (74.1 in), height of 1,427 mm (56.2 in), length of 4,903 mm (193.0 in), and wheelbase of 2,922 mm (115.0 in), with the latter increasing by 74 mm (2.9 in) and 22 mm (0.87 in) respectively, making for a reduced stretch compared to the previous generation. Styling remains similar outside of a more aggressively sporty grille and side ducts, done by original designer Jakob Hirzel. It also features suspension tuning done by Audi's German engineers to achieve a result closer to the European market tune. [ 84 ] Both models feature a Huawei's Qiankun ADS system, with a 31-sensor ADAS suite consisting of 2 LiDARs , 6 mmWave radars , 11 cameras, and 12 ultrasonic sensors , and will be capable of semiautonomous assisted driving in highway and urban conditions. [ 83 ] Both are available with the same 2.0-litre 150 kW (201 hp; 204 PS) EA888 engine with twin-motor 48V system as other markets, and the FAW‑Audi version is also available in front-wheel drive with the 110 kW (148 hp; 150 PS) engine tune. [ 84 ] [ 85 ] Rear view Audi A5 Avant Audi A5 Avant rear view Audi A5L (sedan) Audi A5L (sedan) rear view Interior Audi A5L Sportback Audi A5L Sportback rear view Engines [ edit ] The engines used are 2.0-litre in-line four-cylinder petrol engines from the EA888 series, 3.0-litre V6 petrol engines from the EA839 series and 2-litre in-line four-cylinder diesel engines from the EA288 evo series. Unlike its predecessor, the manual gearboxes are no longer available. Instead of fake tailpipe covers as in the previous generation, only real tailpipes are fitted in response to customer feedback. [ 86 ] The A5 B10 is the first model series to use Audi's advanced second-generation mild hybrid called 'MHEV plus technology'. In addition to the familiar belt starter generator , a new powertrain generator with integrated power electronics is placed on the transmission output shaft. In combination with the 48-volt battery, this enables partial electric driving with an output of 24 PS (18 kW; 24 hp) and 230 N⋅m (170 lb⋅ft) of torque. The powertrain generator recuperates energy back into the battery at up to 25 kW. The battery is positioned above the rear axle and has a separate cooling circuit. Overall, the system is designed to increase the fuel efficiency. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] In March 2025, the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) powertrain marketed as the e-hybrid was introduced and it is available two power outputs. The plug-in hybrid powertrain uses the 2.0 TFSI engine from the EA888 series producing 252 PS (185 kW; 249 hp), combined with an electric motor that produces an output of 143 PS (105 kW; 141 hp). The 25.9 kWh lithium-ion battery is positioned above the rear axle with a maximum AC charging power of 11 kW and the charging time from 0 to 100 percent to just 2.5 hours. The e-hybrid model has two driving modes are available: EV and Hybrid. In addition to the two driving modes, the desired charge level can be individually selected for the first time using a digital slider. The e-hybrid model runs on electric power during regenerative braking to utilise the available battery charge to the driver's destination. When this function is activated, the vehicle recovers energy automatically based on route data stored in the navigation system and can also recover energy automatically without an active route guidance.
