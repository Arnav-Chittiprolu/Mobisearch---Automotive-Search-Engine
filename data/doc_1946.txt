Now in its sixth generation, the successor to the Audi 100 is manufactured in Neckarsulm , Germany, and is available in saloon and estate configurations, the latter marketed by Audi as the Avant. Audi's internal numbering treats the A6 as a continuation of the Audi 100 lineage, with the initial A6 designated as a member of the C4-series, followed by the C5, C6, C7, C8 and the C9. The related Audi A7 is essentially a Sportback ( liftback ) version of the C7-series and C8-series A6 but is marketed under its own separate identity and model designation. All generations of the A6 have offered either front-wheel-drive or Torsen -based four-wheel-drive , marketed by Audi as their quattro system. The A6 has also been used as the basis for the company's Allroad models since 1999.

[ 2 ] In 1994, the latest generation (C4) of the Audi 100 received a facelift and was renamed as the Audi A6 , to fit in with Audi's new alphanumeric nomenclature (as the full-size A8 had just been introduced). The exterior was changed only slightly from the "C4" Audi 100 – new front and rear lights, new radiator grille, similarly with chassis and engine and transmission choices. The United Kingdom was the first market to receive the A6, as stock of RHD Audi 100s had run out before expected, and before the rest of mainland Europe. The new engines for the A6 were 1.8-litre 20v inline four-cylinder , 2.0-litre 8v inline-four, 2.6-litre 12V V6 and 2.8-litre 30v V6 petrol engines, with the 2.3-litre inline-five engine being dropped on most markets. For the diesel engines , an inline-four 1.9 Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI), and the inline-five (R5) 2.5 TDI with 103 kW (140 PS; 138 bhp) were available. Most of the engine options were also available with Audi's Torsen -based quattro permanent four-wheel-drive system. The A6 was available with saloon and Avant bodies.

( October 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Audi S6 Audi S6 Upon introducing the C4 series A6, Audi made small revisions to what was previously known as the Audi S4 , renaming it the Audi S6 ; the S4 name would eventually be re-used for a completely different model derived from Audi's smaller Volkswagen Group B platform -based Audi A4 . As this was the first S6 model from Audi, it is commonly referred to as the Ur-S6 , derived from the German augmentative, " Ur sprünglich" (meaning: original). It was available as both a saloon/sedan ( type 4A5), and an "Avant" ( type 4A9) ( estate/wagon ) to European and United States customers, but only as a saloon in Canada, Asia and Australia. From its launch in late 1994, the Audi S6 was powered by a 2,226 cubic centimetres (135.8 cu in) turbocharged inline five-cylinder petrol engine (parts code prefix: 034, identification code: AAN) with a Bosch Motronic electronic engine control unit (ECU), producing a motive power output of 169 kW (230 PS; 227 bhp) at 5,900 rpm and 326 N⋅m (240 lbf⋅ft) at around 1,950 rpm, on high octane "Super Plus" 98RON unleaded petrol. This engine gave the S6 a top speed of 235 km/h (146.0 mph), and allowed it to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 6.7 seconds; with 160 km/h (99.4 mph) being reached in 17.5 seconds. The vehicle was available with a standard six-speed manual transmission (five-speed only in North America), and Audi's dynamic Torsen T-1 Quattro permanent four-wheel-drive system. Audi made a high-performance, 4.2-litre V8 engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AEC) with a Bosch KE-Motronic ECU available as an option in the original European S4s, and made the decision to continue to do so with the S6, making a 213 kW (290 PS; 286 bhp) version of the 4.2 available as an optional upgrade over the 2.2-litre inline five-cylinder turbo. Unlike the five-cylinder turbocharged version, the V8-powered S6 was supplied with a four-speed automatic transmission as standard but kept the Quattro four-wheel-drive. A six-speed manual gearbox was also available as an option. Audi S6 PLUS [ edit ] Audi S6 Plus As a swan song to the C4 platform, an even more powerful, and very limited-production Audi S6 Plus was briefly available to European customers. The S6 Plus, developed by Audi's wholly owned high-performance subsidiary, quattro GmbH , was available for sale during the 1997 model year only (production from June 1996 to October 1997). A total of 952 cars were produced; 855 Avants and 97 saloons. It was powered by another version of the 32-valve (four valves per cylinder) 4.2-litre V8 engine (parts code prefix: 077, identification code: AHK, later to be seen in the Audi S8 as AKH). Audi's performance division reworked key parts of the engine, increasing the maximum power to 240 kW (326 PS; 322 bhp). It was only available with a revised six-speed manual transmission (parts code prefix: 01E, identification code: DGU) ( gear ratios – 1st: 3.500, 2nd: 1.889, 3rd: 1.320, 4th: 1.034, 5th: 0.857, 6th: 0.730), with a final drive ratio of 4.111. Further revisions were made to the suspension, brakes, and wheels. The front brake discs were enlarged to 323 mm (12.7 in) in diameter by 30 mm (1.18 in) thick. Standard wheels were 8Jx17 "Avus" cast aluminium alloy wheels, with an optional 7Jx16 alloy wheel for use with winter tyres was also available. The S6 Plus saloon could reach 100 km/h (62.1 mph) from a standstill in 5.6 seconds, with the Avant a tenth of a second slower at 5.7 seconds.

This A6 was marketed in the same categories as the BMW 5 Series and the Mercedes-Benz E-Class . The redesigned body had a coefficient of drag of 0.28. [ 10 ] In 2000 and 2001, the "C5" A6 was on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list. This A6 was available with 30-valve 2.4- and 2.8-litre V6 engines , with numerous other engine configurations available globally. As an alternative to the manual transmission , a five-speed tiptronic automatic transmission was also available. The C5 saloon variant arrived in mid-1997 in Europe, late 1997 in North America and Australia, and the Avant in 1998. [ 11 ] In Canada, there was no Avant (Audi's name for an estate/wagon ) available at all in 1998 – Audi dropped the C4 Avant at the end of the 1997 model year , and jumped straight to the C5 Avant in 1998 in conjunction with its release in the US. In compliance with federal standards , North American models were equipped with front and rear bumpers that protruded several inches further than their European counterparts, with modified brackets and bumper suspension assemblies as result, and child-seat tethers for occupant safety. In compliance with Canadian law, Canadian models received daytime running lights as standard equipment. North American C5 A6 models received the 2.8-litre, 30-valve V6 engine, the 2.7-litre "Biturbo" V6 also found in the B5 platform S4 , developing 250 PS (184 kW; 247 hp), and the 4.2-litre 40-valve V8 petrol engine with 221 kW (300 PS; 296 hp); the two more powerful engines were only offered with quattro permanent four-wheel drive . The V8 models arrived with significantly altered exterior body panels, with slightly more flared wheel arches (fenders), revised headlamps and grille design (before being introduced in 2002 to all other A6 models), larger wheels (8Jx17-inch), larger brakes, and Torsen -based Quattro permanent four-wheel-drive as standard. In 2002, the A6 received a facelift, with revised headlight and grille design, exposed exhaust tips, and slight changes to accessory body moldings, and tail light colour from red to amber in North American models. A new host of engines were also introduced. The 1.8-litre engine was deleted and replaced by a 2.0-litre powerplant with 96 kW (130 PS; 128 hp). The 1.9-litre Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) was tweaked to produce a maximum power output of 96 kW (130 PS; 128 hp), and 310 N⋅m (229 lb⋅ft) of torque, and was mated to a six-speed manual gearbox . The 2.4-litre V6 was named the BDV 30 valves and  gained an extra 5 hp and better balancing, and the 2.8-litre V6 engine was replaced by a 3.0-litre engine with 162 kW (220 PS; 217 bhp). The turbocharged 2.7-litre was revised, resulting in 184 kW (250 PS; 247 bhp) and 330 N⋅m (243 lb⋅ft), controlled by standard quattro system. The V6 diesel was also slightly modified resulting in 120 kW (163 PS; 161 bhp) (after the second modification) and 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft). A new more powerful V6 diesel was also introduced with 132 kW (180 PS; 178 hp) and 370 N⋅m (273 lb⋅ft). The 4.2-litre V8 engine which arrived in 2001 remained unchanged. Also new was the multitronic continuously variable transmission , available in most front-wheel drive models. All models, except the 2.0-litre petrol and 1.9-litre TDI, were available with Audi's trademark four-wheel-drive system, Quattro. A four-wheel-drive version of the Avant, with raised ground clearance and slightly altered styling, was sold as the Audi allroad quattro . The second-generation A6 was on Car and Driver magazine's Ten Best list for 2000 and 2001. The updated 2005 A6 won the World Car of the Year award for 2005. In addition, the facelifted third-generation A6 3.0T won two Car and Driver "comparos" that pitted it against other sedans like the BMW 5 Series, Mercedes-Benz E-Class, Jaguar XF, and Infiniti M. A long wheelbase version of the A6 C5 was available in China for the first time, making this model the first stretched German sedan developed especially for that country. Crash testing EuroNCAP adult occupant: [ 12 ] IIHS overall frontal offset crash test: [ 13 ] Acceptable S6 and RS 6 [ edit ] Main article: Audi S6 The Audi S6 was a high-powered variant of the A6, featuring a modified version of the 4.2-litre V8 engine producing 250 kW (340 PS; 335 bhp) and 420 N⋅m (310 lb⋅ft). It was available as a saloon and Avant although the Avant version was the only one sold in North America. Main article: Audi RS 6 Audi RS 6 Avant In the late years of the A6 C5 design, an ultra-high-performance limited-run Audi RS 6 model was presented. Weighing in excess of 1,840 kg (4,057 lb) and producing 331 kW (450 PS; 444 bhp) and 560 N⋅m (413 lbf⋅ft), the RS 6 was capable of 0-100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 4.5 seconds, and on to 200 km/h (124.3 mph) in under 17 seconds. Initially available as only an Avant, a saloon variant was later added; the saloon version being the only version available to the North American market. The RS 6 saloon finished first in a May 2003 Car and Driver comparison test against the BMW M5 (E39) , Mercedes-Benz E 55 AMG (W210), and Jaguar S-Type R. [ 14 ] allroad quattro (1999–2005) [ edit ] Audi allroad quattro 2.5 TDI (Germany) Audi allroad quattro 2.5 TDI (Australia) Audi's C5 series A6 Avant formed the basis for a semi-offroad model in 1999, labeled "Audi allroad quattro". Compared to the regular A6, the allroad featured an advanced air suspension system, allowing for increased ground clearance; larger  diameter all-terrain tyres, and flared fenders and bumpers with matte finish, giving it a distinct appearance and more overall flexibility over varying terrain. The allroad's ride height was also increased with 25 mm subframe spacers; and overall frame stiffness increased with reinforced welds on the subframe mounts and A, B, and C pillars, the floor pan being produced with 20% thicker steel. As the name "allroad Quattro" suggests, Audi's Torsen -based quattro permanent four-wheel-drive system was standard equipment for all versions. The standard adjustable air suspension system can lift the car high enough to provide 208 mm (8.2 in) of ground clearance; a low-range mode (an option with manual transmission), absent from other Quattro-equipped vehicles, can be selected with the touch of a button. When used together, the two systems made it possible for the allroad to complete an official Land Rover test-course, thus far it is the only car-based SUV that has been proven capable of doing so in testing. [ citation needed ] Conversely, the air suspension can lower the vehicle down to only 142 mm (5.6 in) above road level, and simultaneously stiffen the spring and damper rates to provide a sporty driving experience, much like that of the conventional A6 with the sports suspension. Audi's 2.7-litre, biturbo V6 petrol engine with 250 PS (184 kW; 247 hp) and 350 N⋅m (258 lb⋅ft) of peak torque was available initially, alongside the 2.5-litre TDI diesel unit with 180 PS (132 kW; 178 hp) and 370 N⋅m (273 lb⋅ft) of torque. A variant of the corporate 4.2-litre V8 petrol engine was made available in 2003, and a less powerful TDI (163 bhp) followed in 2004. Audi stopped production of the allroad in July 2005. Although the model continued to be available for sale throughout 2006 in Europe, there was no 2006 model year for North America. With the return of the "allroad" nameplate to North America, in the form of the 2013 A4 allroad Quattro, the C5-Platform allroad Quattro has begun to take the name "Ur-allroad." The ' Ur- ' is used in the German language, as a prefix to signify 'ancient' or 'early ancestor' (e.g., great-grandmother is Urgroßmutter), and is used informally by car enthusiasts worldwide to refer to the original [ 15 ] Audi Quattro that was produced from 1980 to 1991 (the "Ur-Quattro"). The use of the term was then extended to the original S4 and S6 models to differentiate them from later models with the same name, and more recently to the C5 allroad models ("Ur-allroad").

Designed by Satoshi Wada in 2001, this model is visually an evolution of the C5, but was lengthened to 4,927 mm (194.0 in), and has the new Audi "single-frame grille". Like other contemporary Audis, the A6 has a "tornado line" that runs from the front lights to the rear lights just below the body shoulders. [ 19 ] The C6 iteration of the A6 features more sophisticated technology. Most notable is the Multi Media Interface (MMI), which is a system controlling in-car entertainment, satellite navigation, climate control, car settings such as suspension configuration and optional electronic accessories through a central screen interface. This has the advantage of minimising the wealth of buttons normally found on a dashboard by replacing them with controls that operate multiple devices using the integrated display. On the engines, the new Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct injection technology was introduced. Although the line of engines represents the same progression as the former model, all engines were new. The multitronic continuously variable transmission continues as an alternative for front-wheel-drive models, alongside a new six-speed tiptronic automatic transmission model 09E available in the four-wheel-drive models. Audi's "trademark" Torsen -based Quattro permanent four-wheel-drive is available in most of the lineup, and standard in the most powerful models. Quattro is not available on the Multitronic variants of the A6, but is available on the manual and Tiptronic gear systems. Conversely, the Tiptronic system is not available on the front-wheel-drive variants of the car. The six-speed manual gearbox is available with the 3.2-litre V6 engine , but not for the North American market. The Avant was previewed by the Audi Avantissimo concept in 2001 and arrived during the course of 2005. The A6 All-road Quattro made its debut in 2006, and as before, is an off-road-ready version of the Avant, available with either a 2.7-litre V6 or 3.0-litre V6 Turbocharged Direct Injection diesel engines , or a 3.2-litre V6 or 4.2-litre V8 petrol engine . A6L (2005–2009) [ edit ] This is a long wheelbase version of the A6 sedan for the Chinese market. The vehicle was unveiled in 2005 at the Shanghai Motor Show . The vehicles went on sale in the middle of 2005. Early models include A6L 2.4, with A6L 2.0 TFSI (170 PS) followed shortly after. A6L 3.0 Quattro (218 PS) and A6L 4.2 Quattro (335 PS) were introduced in 2005. Other models include A6 3.0. [ 20 ] S6 [ edit ] Main article: Audi S6 The Audi S6 performance variant was introduced in the Frankfurt Motor Show , and produced from early 2006 until 2011. It is powered by a 5.2-litre Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) V10 engine producing 320 kW (435 PS; 429 bhp) and 540 N⋅m (398 lbf⋅ft) of torque. The S6 reaches 100 km/h (62.1 mph) from a standstill in 5.2 seconds and a quarter mile in 13.5 seconds. [ 21 ] A6 allroad quattro (2006–2011) [ edit ] Pre-facelift A6 allroad quattro 3.0 TDI Facelift A6 allroad quattro 3.0 TFSI Facelift A6 allroad quattro 3.0 TDI Facelift A6 allroad quattro 3.0 TFSI Audi announced the C6 series allroad in 2005 and released it the following year. This model was called the Audi A6 allroad quattro (unlike the previous version, the Audi allroad quattro , with no reference to the A6 nomenclature). The Audi A6 allroad quattro again featured adaptive air suspension and quattro permanent four-wheel drive system. The A6 allroad was powered by a choice of two Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) petrol engines , a 3.2-litre V6 and a 4.2-litre V8, and two TDI diesel engines , a 180 PS (132 kW) 2.7 L and a 225 PS (165 kW) (233 only in the US) 3.0 L. The tiptronic gearbox is standard on the 4.2 V8 and the 2.7 TDI, but optional on the 3.2 FSI and 3.0 TDI. The five-mode air suspension can be raised by up to 60 mm (2.36 in) to provide ground clearance of 185 mm (7.28 in) which is better than the older four-mode. The car featured a number of off-road styling cues including larger bumpers and sills. In some European markets, this A6 allroad quattro was more expensive than the larger Audi Q7 , but an air suspension is an expensive option in the Q7. In its native country, Germany, it cost a few hundred Euros less than the Q7.

C6 facelift [ edit ] Sedan (facelift) Avant (facelift) Audi unveiled a facelifted "C6" Audi A6 on 12 August 2008, at the Moscow International Motor Show . The refresh incorporates some modern Audi design cues to keep the A6 current with the rest of the Audi lineup. There are minor cosmetic changes to the front and rear lights which now have daytime running LEDs , the taillights extend towards the centre of the trunk lid and pinch off at the license plate mount, however, their shape remains rectangular compared to the more sculpted light clusters found in the 2008 Audi A5, 2008 Audi A4, and 2009 Audi Q5 (the latter three being all-new generations). The intakes below the headlamps are inspired by the Audi RS5. [ 22 ] The A6's six (per side) front light-emitting diode (LED) daytime running lights (DRLs) are located within the main headlamp housing, similar to RS6's placement of the LEDs (ten per side), whereas on the S6 these front LEDs (five per side) are found adjacent to the fog lamps in the lower front bumper. The new front and rear fascias from RS6 would be used on the facelifted A6 and S6 lineup. There are now six petrol and four diesel engines available for the upgraded A6. All petrol engines now feature cylinder-direct Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) technology, and all diesel engines now feature common rail (CR) and Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) technologies. There is a new petrol engine, a 300 PS (221 kW; 296 bhp), 3.0-litre supercharged V6 - badged either 3.0 TFSI or 3.0T. This new engine is shared with the B8-generation Audi S4 and S5 , although slightly detuned vs. the S-cars, and makes the A6 3.0T only 0.1 seconds slower 0–60 mph (97 km/h) than the more powerful but heavier 4.2 V8 variant and 5.2 V10-bearing S6 . [ 23 ] Also updated for 2009 is the Quattro all-wheel-drive setup, which is already found on the 2008 Audi A5 and 2008 Audi A4. This new system features a 40/60 front-to-rear torque split and offers a more balanced feel, reducing the understeer that comes from 50/50 AWD platforms. [ 22 ] US models went on sale as 2009 model year vehicles, and arrived in dealerships by the beginning of January. Early models include A6 3.2 FSI (sedan), A6 3.0 TFSI quattro (sedan/Avant), A6 4.2 FSI quattro (sedan), S6 5.2 FSI (sedan). [ 24 ] RS6 (2008–2010) [ edit ] Main article: Audi RS6 RS6 sedan The latest version of ultra-high-performance Audi RS6 was launched in September 2008 and produced until the third quarter of 2010. Based upon the V10 engine powering the S6, the RS6 features an all-aluminium alloy 4,991 cc (304.6 cu in) V10 twin-turbocharged , Fuel Stratified Injection engine with a dry sump lubrication system. It produces a power output of 426 kW (579 PS; 571 bhp), and 650 N⋅m (479 lbf⋅ft) of torque, making it the most powerful vehicle ever produced by Audi at the time. This has now been surpassed by the Audi R8. Initially available only as an Avant, the saloon version went on sale in mid-October 2008. A6L (2009–2012) [ edit ] Audi A6 L (China) The A6L is a longer wheelbase version of the A6 sedan for the Chinese market. The vehicle was unveiled at Auto Shanghai 2009. [ 25 ] Early models included the 2.7 TDI powerplant (189 PS). [ 26 ] The Audi A6L was also converted into the form of a pickup truck although only two examples are known to exist on the roads.

It is heavily influenced by the Audi A8 (D4), pulling elements from its exterior details. [ 38 ] [ 39 ] The A6 shares its interior, platform, and powertrain ( Modular Longitudinal Platform ) with the Audi A7 four door sedan, which had been released shortly before also in 2011. Compared to the A8 and A7, the A6 has the most aggressive front fascia and LED headlights (optional full LED headlamps ). Design work began in 2006, with Jurgen Loffler's exterior design being chosen in 2008. [ 40 ] The new A6 increased its wheelbase by nearly 3 in (76 mm) and its width by 2.7 in (69 mm). The redesign also decreased the car's drag coefficient to 0.25. European engine choices for the C7 include two petrol engines – a 2.8-litre FSI V6 with 204 hp (152 kW) and a 300 hp (224 kW), 3.0-litre supercharged FSI engine – and two diesel engines – a 2.0-litre inline four-cylinder and a 3.0-litre turbocharged diesel engine in three states of tune.

[ 49 ] A6 allroad quattro (2012–2018) [ edit ] A6 allroad quattro The 2013 A6 allroad Quattro was unveiled at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show , alongside the 2012 RS4 Avant . Sales began in 2012. The first UK deliveries arrived in July 2012. The allroad variant contains several unique features. Audi designed more than 1,100 new, unique parts for the allroad, setting it apart from the standard A6 and making it a true all-terrain vehicle. [ citation needed ] Most obvious, the allroad received special bumpers and fender flares, giving it an aggressive offroad appearance. The bumpers and fender flares feature a tough-wearing, matte finish, contrasting the rest of the body. The roof received this same coating, as well as four longitudinal ribs for increased strength. The unique bumpers also have integrated aluminium skid plates. The allroad featured larger diameter tires than the standard A6 for improved offroad capabilities. Redesigned headlights, larger side mirrors, and a lack of door "rub strips" are unique to the allroad. The allroad comes standard with an adjustable air suspension system can lift the car high enough to provide 208 mm (8 in) of ground clearance; a low-range mode (an option with manual transmission), absent from other quattro-equipped vehicles, can be selected with the touch of a button. When used together, the two systems made it possible for the allroad to complete an official Land Rover test-course, thus far it is the only car-based SUV that has been proven capable of doing so in testing. [ citation needed ] Conversely, the air suspension can lower the vehicle down to only 142 mm (6 in) above road level, and simultaneously stiffen the spring and damper rates to provide a sporty driving experience, much like that of the conventional A6 with the sports suspension. It went on sale in early 2012. Early variants included 3.0 TFSI quattro (310 PS), 3.0 TDI quattro (204 PS), 3.0 TDI quattro (245 PS), 3.0 TDI quattro (313 PS).

[ 112 ] In February 2025 this renaming was cancelled, therefore the internal combustion engine version is marketed as the sixth-generation A6. [ 113 ] The sixth-generation A6 was officially unveiled on 4 March 2025, firstly as the Avant station wagon model. Orders for the A6 Avant began in March 2025 with deliveries set to commence in late May 2025. [ 114 ] The sedan model was unveiled on 15 April 2025, with sales of the sedan model started in the same month. [ 115 ] The new A6 is built on the PPC (Premium Platform Combustion) architecture, which made its debut on the A5 (B10) . The platform can also be equipped with all-wheel steering and a Quattro sport differential on Quattro all-wheel drive models. The A6 is also available with the adaptive air suspension and second-generation digital OLED lighting technology. Audi claims the A6 Avant is the most aerodynamic Audi Avant model with a combustion engine with a drag coefficient of 0.25, part of this is because of the large air curtains and controllable air intakes at the front, the design of the roof spoiler, and aerodynamic panels on the sides of the rear window. The A6 Avant is 60 mm (2.4 in) longer than its predecessor. [ 116 ] [ 117 ] Audi claims the interior of the A6 offers "a first-class experience". The dashboard features an 11.9-inch digital driver's display, 14.5-inch infotainment touchscreen display, and an optional 10.9-inch front passenger touchscreen display. Other available interior features are a 3D Bang & Olufsen sound system, an adjustable panoramic sunroof, an air quality package includes an ionizer and fine dust sensor, and four-zone automatic climate control. The A6 Avant has a maximum boot space of 1,532 L (54.1 cu ft) when the rear seats folded, which can be folded separately in 40:20:40 format. [ 114 ] [ 117 ] Rear view Audi A6 Avant Rear view Interior, A6 C9 Engines [ edit ] All engines are equipped with the MHEV Plus mild hybrid system includes a 48-volt battery, belt-alternator starter , and an electric motor/generator. At full acceleration, the electric motor can provide an additional 24 PS (18 kW; 24 hp) and 230 N⋅m (170 lb⋅ft) of torque, while also using the braking energy to recharge the small battery. According to Audi, this setup allows the A6 to drive solely on electric power during low-speed maneuvers. [ 116 ] In May 2025, the plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV) powertrain marketed as the e-hybrid quattro was introduced and it is available two power outputs. The plug-in hybrid powertrain uses the 2.0 TFSI engine from the EA888 series producing 252 PS (185 kW; 249 hp), combined with an electric motor that produces an output of 143 PS (105 kW; 141 hp). The 25.9 kWh lithium-ion battery is positioned above the rear axle, the battery capacity increase by 45% compared to its predecessor, which means the A6 models can drive more than 100 km (62 miles) in electric-only range. The maximum AC charging power of 11 kW and the charging time duration from 0 to 100 percent in just 2.5 hours. The degree of thrust recuperation performance in electric driving mode (EV mode) can be adjusted to three different levels using paddles on the steering wheel and the vehicle automatically recovers energy when this function is activated. Two operating modes are available to the hybrid management system: “EV” and “hybrid.” In EV mode, the plug-in hybrid models run solely on electric power. In hybrid mode, the hybrid management system maintains a specific charge level as needed in order to save enough electrical energy for later use.  Combined with the quattro ultra drive and standard all-wheel steering, the electrified dual-clutch transmission increases manoeuvrability at low speeds and provides additional stability at higher speeds.

By 2012 many government officials in China began driving with Audi A6s. After a 1994 campaign from the Chinese government to have officials stop driving Mercedes stretch limousines, the officials began using black Audi A6 cars. Michael Wines of The New York Times wrote that "More than a perk, the black Audi is a rolling advertisement for its occupant’s importance and impunity in a nation obsessed with status."
