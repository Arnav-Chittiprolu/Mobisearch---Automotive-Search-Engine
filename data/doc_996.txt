It was the most expensive model in the Chevrolet range at this time, with the Standard Mercury providing an affordable product between 1933 and 1937. [ 1 ] Starting with this generation, all GM cars shared a corporate appearance as a result of the Art and Color Section headed by Harley Earl . [ 1 ] From 1940 a more expensive version based on the Master Deluxe was launched called the Special Deluxe . The updated corporate appearance introduced a concealed radiator behind a façade with a grille. This was the last Chevrolet that was exported to Japan in knock-down kits and assembled at the company's factory in Osaka, Japan before the factory was appropriated by the Imperial Japanese Government. When Toyota decided to develop their own sedan called the Toyota AA , a locally manufactured Master was disassembled and examined to determine how Toyota should engineer their own cars. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] In May 1925 the Chevrolet Export Boxing plant at Bloomfield, New Jersey was repurposed from a previous owner where Knock-down kits for Chevrolet, Pontiac, Oldsmobile, Buick and Cadillac passenger cars, and both Chevrolet and G. M. C. truck parts are crated and shipped by railroad to the docks at Weehawken, New Jersey for overseas GM assembly factories. [ 1 ] Model years [ edit ] The Master name was used on a number of different versions, and the Series name changed each year. A four door open top convertible was no longer offered starting in 1933. 1933 (Series CA) [ edit ] Main article: Chevrolet Series CA Eagle / Master The 1933 Series CA began production as the "Eagle", but was renamed "Master" midway through the model year when the 1933 Standard model (Series CC) was introduced.  Several changes were made to the Eagle when the name was changed to Master.  The easiest to distinguishing feature is the post between the front door wing windows and the roll down windows: on the Eagle the chrome divider between these two windows goes down as the window goes down, whereas on the Master this divider remains fixed and does not go down with the window. 1934 (Series DA) [ edit ] The Series DA Master offered an increased wheelbase of 112 in (2,844.8 mm). This increased the difference with the cheaper Standard wheelbase to 5 in (127.0 mm). Powered by an upgraded version of the 206 cu in (3,380 cc) "Stovebolt" six-cylinder engine , now producing 80 hp (60 kW). The independent front suspension was something GM called " Knee-Action " using trailing arms and coil springs. 1935 (Series EA and ED) [ edit ] The Master underwent a redesign, utilising a new "Turret Top" construction method. This consisted of steel used entirely in the body construction to include the roof and wood was no longer used in bodywork or chassis construction. [ 4 ] · [ 5 ] 1936 (Series FA and FD) [ edit ] All Chevrolet took on an upgraded streamlined appearance as Chevrolet sought to take on a new and modern appearance called Art Deco , and the bodies were shared with the Pontiac Deluxe .
