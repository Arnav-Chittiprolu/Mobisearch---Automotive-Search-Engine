From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This article needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2025 ) This is a list of self-driving car system (SDS) suppliers and self-driving truck system (SDS) suppliers. Definitions [ edit ] Light vehicles (LV) include passenger cars, whereas heavy vehicles (HV) include trucks and buses. Driverless operation means operating vehicles without a human safety driver, that is SAE Level 4 or 5 . Operational design domain (ODD) is the operating conditions in which the SDS can operate, which may be limited in the environment or traffic characteristics. A restricted ODD is limited by design to specific areas or industries, for example highway driving only, or private-ground operation in mine sites or ports .
