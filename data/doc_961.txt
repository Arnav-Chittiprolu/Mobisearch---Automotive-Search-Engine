It was offered exclusively as a 5-door hatchback which since then has become a crossover SUV model. The term "LEAF" serves as a backronym to l eading e nvironmentally-friendly a ffordable f amily car . [ 3 ] The Leaf was unveiled on 1 August 2009 [ 4 ] as the world's first mass market electric and zero-emission vehicle. [ 5 ] Among other awards and recognition, it received the 2010 Green Car Vision Award , the 2011 European Car of the Year , the 2011 World Car of the Year , and the 2011–2012 Car of the Year Japan . The Leaf's range on a full charge has been steadily increased from 117 km (73 miles) to 364 km (226 miles) ( EPA rated) by the use of larger battery packs and several minor improvements. As of September 2021 [update] , European sales totalled more than 208,000, [ 6 ] and as of December 2021 [update] , over 165,000 had been sold in the U.S., [ 7 ] and 157,000 in Japan. [ 8 ] Global sales across both generations totalled 577,000 by February 2022. [ 9 ] The Leaf was the world's all-time top selling plug-in electric car until it was surpassed in early 2020 by the Tesla Model 3 . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] First generation (ZE0; 2010) [ edit ] 2013 Nissan Leaf (Australia) Main article: Nissan Leaf (first generation) The first generation Nissan Leaf was in production from 2010 to 2017. It was unveiled on 1 August 2009 [ 4 ] as the world's first series produced battery electric vehicle . [ 5 ] Before it officially commenced production, Nissan developed three prototype battery electric vehicles—dubbed the EV-01, EV-02 and EV-11. The former two were based on the Z11 Nissan Cube while the latter was based on the C11 Nissan Tiida . [ 12 ] It began production on 22 October 2010 at the Oppama facility in Yokosuka , Kanagawa. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Until early 2013, models sold in Europe and the US were imported from the Oppama plant adapted stylistically for the respective markets. On 12 December 2012, battery manufacturing began at the Smyrna plant, with official production of the Leaf initiating on 9 January 2013. Manufacturing in the UK began on 28 March 2013. Initially, the Leaf was available exclusively with a large battery pack composed of 192 flat, laminated lithium-ion cells developed in collaboration with NEC , which offers advantages such as simplified design, efficient cooling, and optimal packaging. The battery pack is located under the floor and between the wheels, optimising the vehicle's handling and interior space. The electric motor produces 80 kW (110 hp) of power with a range of about 160 km (100 miles) when the battery is fully charged. Recharging can take 16 hours on 120 V or 8 hours on 230 V power. Fast charging is also available with a specific charger, which can restore 80% of the battery capacity in approximately 30 minutes. The first generation Leaf garnered both acclaim and criticism from multiple automotive critics. Car and Driver , an American automotive magazine, expressed unfavourable opinions about the inexpensive materials used in the vehicle, asserting that they seem more fitting for a car priced at half its actual cost. However, they commended the Leaf for its spacious boot/trunk, along with features like standard heated seats and, in higher-end models, a heated steering wheel and leather seats. Opinions on the battery performance and safety aspects vary, with some finding the battery and range underwhelming and others expressing concerns about safety levels. Second generation (ZE1; 2017) [ edit ] Motor vehicle Second generation 2018 Nissan Leaf N-Connecta (UK) Overview Model code ZE1 Production October 2017 – June 2025 Model years 2018 – 2025 Assembly Japan: Yokosuka, Kanagawa ( Oppama Plant ) United States: Smyrna, Tennessee United Kingdom: Sunderland ( NMUK ) Designer Kazuhiko Watanabe [ 16 ] Powertrain Electric motor 110 or 160 kW EM57 , synchronous [ 17 ] Transmission Single-speed fixed (8.193:1 ratio) Battery 40 or 62 kWh lithium-ion [ 18 ] Range 40 kWh : EPA: 240 km (149 miles) WLTP: 274 km (170 miles) 62 kWh : EPA: 341 km (212 miles) Plug-in charging AC onboard charger: 6.6 kW at 27.5 A DC : 50 or 100 kW J1772 or Type 2 and CHAdeMO connectors Dimensions Wheelbase 2,700 mm (106.3 in) Length 4,490 mm (176.8 in) Width 1,788 mm (70.4 in) Height 1,530 mm (60.2 in) Curb weight 1,580–1,640 kg (3,483–3,616 lb) In October 2017, for the 2018 model year, Nissan launched the new generation Leaf in Japan, and deliveries in North America and Europe began in February 2018. [ 19 ] In 2018, global sales reached a record level of 87,149 units, third behind the Tesla Model 3 and the BAIC EC-Series . [ 20 ] Mechanically, the second generation Leaf is similar to the first, while adding more range, and more power. Stylistically, it is a major departure from the previous model. [ 21 ] The interior adds Android Auto & Apple CarPlay . It has a 40 kWh battery pack (39 kWh usable) with an EPA-rated range of 243 km (151 miles). [ 18 ] The electric motor produces 110 kW (147 hp) and 320 N⋅m (236 lb⋅ft) of torque. [ 17 ] It charges through either a 6.6 kW regular plug ( SAE J1772 in US/Japan, or a Type 2 connector in EU countries) or a 50 kW CHAdeMO , and has the ability to send power back to the grid . [ 22 ] Propilot Assist, a lane centering system, is available on the two highest trim levels for an additional cost, and has automatic parking in some markets. [ 23 ] The car offers one-pedal braking where easing off the accelerator pedal causes significant regenerative braking, to the point where the vehicle can be brought to a complete stop without the driver touching the brake pedal, at which point hydraulic brakes are automatically applied, to hold the vehicle in position. [ 24 ] From 2019, a Leaf e+ (Leaf Plus in North America) variant has been offered. It has a larger 62 kWh battery (59 kWh usable) providing an EPA range of 364 km (226 miles), [ 25 ] and a new 160 kW motor. It can use CHAdeMO chargers up to 100 kW. [ 26 ] In September 2020, Nissan showed off a novel UK prototype emergency services version of the Leaf for natural disaster response, dubbed the RE-LEAF, [ 27 ] based on the 62 kWh LEAF e+ (sold in the U.S. as the Plus). [ 28 ] The working concept vehicle is ruggedized with an elevated ride height of 70 mm (2.8 in), underbody protection and all-terrain tires on motorsport wheels. It is intended to serve as a reliable mobile power source for a small command center, offering weatherproof external power outlets for site lighting, tools or emergency medical equipment. Other modifications include a cargo area in place of the rear seats, separated from the passenger area by a cage, a rear hatch area that opens to a workstation area with pull-out computer desk and 810 mm (32 in) LCD monitor, and roof-mounted emergency lights. [ 29 ] While there was no word of an actual production version, the concept was well received in the automotive, EV and tech media. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In June 2022, the Leaf received a facelift for the 2023 model year. In the US, the EPA range was slightly reduced to 240 km (149 miles) for the 40 kWh version and 341 km (212 miles) for the 62 kWh version.

The N-Connecta adds from Acenta an intelligent around view monitor with moving object detection and front and rear parking sensors, part synthetic leather and cloth trim, heat pack with heated seats and heated steering wheel, 43 centimetre (17 inch) alloy wheels, and privacy glass. Tekna adds from N-Connecta ProPILOT Advanced Driver Assistance System, Bose speakers, part leather seats with Ultrasuede trim, LED fog lamps with cornering function, and electronic parking brake. North America [ edit ] The North American Leafs were initially sold in S, SV and SL trim lines. In 2018, for the 2019 model year, the S Plus, SV Plus, and SL Plus trims were added. The S and SV trim levels can be had with either the Leaf or Leaf Plus battery pack. The SL is only available in the Leaf Plus configuration. [ 34 ] The Mexican model arrived on 24 August 2018 as a 2019 model, and was offered in S, SL, and SL Bitono trim lines. [ 35 ] Production and future plans [ edit ] In celebration of World EV Day , 9 September 2020, Nissan marked the production of the 500,000th LEAF. [ 36 ] UK production ceased in March 2024, after 270,000 units produced in Sunderland plant, both generations included.

[ 39 ] In 2022, the Leaf was chosen as the 'Best Family Electric Car' at the UK Carbuyer’s Best Used Car Awards. [ 40 ] Third generation (ZE2; 2025) [ edit ] Motor vehicle Third generation Overview Model code ZE2 Production June 2025 – present [ 41 ] Model years 2026 Assembly Japan: Kaminokawa, Tochigi ( Tochigi Plant ) [ 41 ] United Kingdom: Sunderland ( NMUK ) [ 42 ] Body and chassis Layout Front-motor, front-wheel-drive Platform AmpR Medium [ 43 ] Related Nissan Ariya Powertrain Battery 52 kWh NMC 75 kWh NMC Electric range up to 488 km (303 miles) (EPA) 436–604 km (271–375 miles) (WLTP) Plug-in charging DC: 150 kW NACS & J1772 (North America) CCS2 (European) Dimensions Wheelbase 2,690 mm (105.9 in) Length 4,350 mm (171.3 in) Width 1,810 mm (71.3 in) Height 1,550 mm (61.0 in) Nissan began to release details of the third-generation Leaf in March 2025. It was unveiled on 17 June 2025, with substantial updates to its design, platform, and performance. The model is expected to be released later that year. Departing from its previous hatchback form, the new Leaf will adopt a subcompact crossover -style body built on the AmpR Medium (previously known as CMF-EV) platform, [ 43 ] shared with the larger Nissan Ariya compact crossover. [ 44 ] Significantly, the new Leaf will be available with active liquid-cooled battery packs for the first time, rather than the passive air-cooled packs used in previous versions. The new Leaf will retain a single-motor, front-wheel-drive layout but will not offer dual-motor, all-wheel-drive unlike the Ariya. Availability has been confirmed for North America, Europe, Japan, and Australia. [ 45 ] Nissan has stated that the vehicle will offer "significant range improvements", with an estimated driving range of 490 km (303 miles) (EPA) on select configurations—compared to the previous model’s EPA-rated range of 240 to 341 km (149 to 212 miles). [ 44 ] Nissan claims the European version will have a range of 340 km (211 miles) at a steady speed of 129 km/h (80 mph). [ 46 ] The Leaf will also support a faster charging rate of 150 kW and become the first Nissan vehicle to adopt the North American Charging System (NACS), making it compatible with the Tesla Supercharger network. [ 45 ] In North America, the driver's side front fender contains a J1772 port (without CCS) for up to Level 2 charging, while the NACS port is located on the passenger side front fender. [ 47 ] In North America, Nissan claims the battery can charge from 10–80% in 35 minutes when DC fast charging, or about 30 minutes for the European version. [ 47 ] It has a lower C d =0.25 (0.26 in North America) compared to the previous generation's 0.29. [ 47 ] Two liquid-cooled NMC lithium-ion battery options are available, both of which offer thermal conditioning functionality. The 52 kWh battery is paired with a motor outputting 130 kW (174 hp) and 344 N⋅m (254 lb⋅ft) of torque. The 75 kWh battery is paired with a 160 kW (214 hp) motor with 354 N⋅m (261 lb⋅ft) of torque. [ 47 ] Rear view Interior Nissan Chill-Out Concept Global sales [ edit ] The production version was unveiled in August 2009. [ 48 ] After receiving 20,000 pre-orders in the United States, [ 49 ] Nissan stopped taking reservations in the United States until early 2011. Production in Japan started in October 2010, [ 13 ] and delivery in the US [ 50 ] and Japan began in December, with deliveries in other markets beginning in early 2012. By December 2020 the Leaf was sold in 59 markets around the world. [ 51 ] The Leaf was the world's best selling electric car from 2011 to 2014 [ 52 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] and 2016. [ 55 ] Sales fell in 2015 with overall sales led by the Tesla Model S . [ 53 ] [ 56 ] As of December 2019 [update] , the Leaf listed as the world's all-time best selling plug-in electric car . [ 57 ] By early 2020, the Tesla Model 3 surpassed the Leaf to become the new best selling electric car in history. [ 10 ] By February 2022, global Leaf deliveries totaled 577,000 cars. [ 9 ] As of September 2021 [update] , Europe was listed as the biggest market with more than 208,000 units sold, [ 6 ] of which 72,620 units had been registered in Norway, the leading European national market. [ 58 ] As of December 2021 [update] , U.S. sales totaled 165,710 units through December 2021, [ 7 ] and 157,059 units in Japan.
