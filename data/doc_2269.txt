The Czech Republic has one of the lowest rates of plug-in electric vehicles on newly registered automobiles among [[OECD]] countries (only 0,3 % in 2018). It is becoming relevant topic for the country, especially for the [[Škoda Auto|Škoda]] auto, the Czech greatest representative of the automobile industry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ihned.cz/c1-66528610-zajistujeme-pro-cesko-ctvrtinu-exportu-tak-nas-podporte-v-prechodu-na-elektromobily-zada-vladu-sef-skody|title=Zajišťujeme pro Česko čtvrtinu exportu, tak nás podpořte v přechodu na elektromobily, žádá vládu šéf Škody|first=Eva|last=Srpová|date=March 18, 2019|website=Hospodářské noviny (iHNed.cz)}}</ref>

Hence, experimentally empirical research on Czech consumers’ preferences was conducted, whose aim was to evaluate the efficiency of various incentives that might promote the market with plug-in electric vehicles in the Czech Republic. The research has shown that except the price, the most relevant factors affecting the willingness to pay for the relatively expensive plug-in electric vehicles are: better fuel-efficiency (CZK 52,000 more on average for a reduction in operating costs of CZK 1 per 1&nbsp;km for a new car), increase in driving range (CZK 28,000 more on average for an increase in driving range of 100&nbsp;km), battery-charging time, financial support for electrical wiring in households, free parking in cities or environmental factors (26–40 thousand CZK for each 20% emission reduction). On the other hand, free motorway toll sticker or special traffic lane has non-significant effect on the incentives to buy the vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://idea.cerge-ei.cz/files/IDEA_Studie_02_2019_Elektromobily/IDEA_Studie_02_2019_Elektromobily.html|title=IDEA_Studie_02_2019_Elektromobily|website=idea.cerge-ei.cz}}</ref>

In 2016, battery electric vehicles lost access to their registration tax exemption.

This was an agreed minimum deal of improvements most parties could get behind due to the symbolic meaning that cars under 400K DKK including VAT (which itself has deductions for efficient cars) would experience the old full registration tax exception matching 2019–2020 delivers of the cheaper but long range models such as Tesla Model 3 LR, LEAF 60 kWh model and Hyundai Kona Electric 60 kWh model. These models could be argued being the first non-premium cars useful for the people with the longest daily drives which makes the close to or financial positive compared to cheap compacts. Until 2019 only premium cars, under much fuss due to the large per car exemptions, or short-range users had a financial incentive alone to buy a full BEV instead of a mild Hybris{{Clarify|date=April 2021}}. This 2018 push was after yet another round of discussions of even further incentives failed – a current split between moving too slowly and losing too much of the 57B DKK yearly income. 2018 law includes backstop moving from 5K to 10K cars sold since start of 2016 under this plan at which point incentives has to be revisited.

Since 2008 France has a [[bonus–malus]] system offering a financial incentive, or bonus, for the purchase of cars with low [[carbon emissions]], and a fee, or malus, for the purchase of high-emission vehicles. The bonus applies to private and company vehicles purchased on or after 5 December 2007 and are deduced from the purchase price of the vehicle. The malus penalty applies to all vehicles registered after 1 January 2008, and is added at the time of registration. Since 2009, every family with more than two children receives a deduction from the malus of 20 g of {{CO2}} per km per child.<ref name=EUenvironTax>{{cite web | url=http://www.ieep.eu/assets/1398/ETR_in_Europe_-_Annex_2_3_4.pdf | title=Environmental Tax Reform in Europe: Opportunities for the Future | publisher=[[Institute for European Environmental Policy]] (IEEP) | date=2014-05-30 | access-date=2016-10-08 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009191722/http://www.ieep.eu/assets/1398/ETR_in_Europe_-_Annex_2_3_4.pdf | archive-date=2016-10-09 }}'' See Chapter 3 – Car Registration Tax ('Bonus-Malus' system) in France pp. 15-21.''</ref>

Until July 31, 2012, a premium up to {{euro|5,000}}, under the bonus-malus system, was granted for the purchase of new cars with {{CO2}} emissions of 60 g/km or less which benefited [[battery electric vehicle|all-electric cars]] and any [[plug-in hybrid]] with such low emissions.

For example, an electric car sold for {{euro|23,333}} including VAT was eligible for the maximum bonus of {{euro|7000}}. The emission level for the maximum bonus was raised to 20 g/km or less. Cars with emission levels between 20 and 50 g/km were eligible to a bonus of up to {{euro|5,000}}, and between 50 and 60 g/km were eligible to a bonus of up to {{euro|4,500}}.

{{As of|2016|09}}, the government proposal to be in force from 1 January 2017 provides that the {{euro|10,000}} super-bonus for scrapping a diesel vehicle over 10 years-old was planned to be renewed. However, the bonus for the purchase of a pure electric car was slated to drop to {{euro|6000}} from {{euro|6300}} in 2016, but to compensate, the additional scrappage bonus was to be increased to {{euro|4000}} from {{euro|3700}} in 2016. Also, the government plans to introduce a purchase price cap to the vehicles eligible for the bonus, and to introduce a new bonus for two-wheeled motor vehicles. For the more polluting vehicles, the government intends to increase the maximum malus fee to {{euro|10000}} from {{euro|8000}} in 2016 for vehicles emitting more than 191 g/km, lowering the limit from 200 g/km in 2016.<ref name=bonus2017>{{cite web | url=http://www.avem.fr/actualite-projet-de-loi-de-finances-2017-decryptage-6212.html | title= Projet de loi de finances 2017 : décryptage |language=fr | trans-title= Bill 2017 Finance: deciphering |first=Tiphaine |last=Leurent |publisher= Association pour l'Avenir du Véhicule Electrique Méditerranéen (AVEM)|date=2016-09-29 |access-date=2016-10-08}}</ref>

The government intended to maintain the {{euro|1000}} purchase bonus for plug-in hybrids with a {{CO2}} emission level between 21 and 60 g/km. However, the proposal does not include anything about the conversion premium for scrapping a 10-year-old diesel car for the purchase of a plug-in hybrid. The purchase bonus for non-rechargeable hybrid vehicles was to be eliminated.<ref name=bonus2017/>

The private use of a company car is treated as taxable income in Germany and measured at a flat monthly rate of 1% of the vehicle's gross list price. So plug-in electric cars have been at a disadvantage since their price tag can be as much as double that of a car using a conventional internal combustion engine due to the high cost of the battery. In June 2013 German legislators approved a law that ends the tax disadvantage for corporate plug-in electric cars. The law, backdated to 1 January 2013, allows private users to offset the list price with {{euro|500}} per unit of battery size, expressed in [[kilowatt hour]]s (kWh). The maximum offset was set at {{euro|10,000}} corresponding to a 20 [[kWh]] battery. The amount one can offset will sink annually by {{euro|50}} per kilowatt hour.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/germany-electricvehicles-tax-idUSL5N0EJ1Y320130607|title=Germany ends tax disadvantage for corporate electric cars |work=[[Reuters]] |date=2013-06-07|access-date=2013-06-24}}</ref> The range criteria will rise to {{Convert|40|km|abbr=on}} starting in 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euractiv.com/sections/transport/berlin-approves-new-incentives-electric-car-drivers-308700|title=Berlin approves new incentives for electric car drivers|first=Daniel |last=Tost |work=EurActiv &#124; EU News & policy debates, across languages |publisher=EurActiv.com|date=2014-09-25|access-date=2014-09-25}}</ref> As part of the package of financial incentives approved in 2016, private owners of plug-in electric vehicles that charge their cars in their employer premises are exempted from declaring this perk as a cash benefit in their income tax return.

In August 2014, the federal government announced its plan to introduce non-monetary incentives through new legislation to be effective by 1 February 2015. The proposed user benefits include measures to privilege battery-powered cars, fuel cell vehicles and some plug-in hybrids, just like Norway does, by granting local governments the authority to allow these vehicles into bus lanes, and to offer free parking and reserved parking spaces in locations with charging points.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kfz-betrieb.vogel.de/neuwagen/handel/articles/454644/?cmp=nl-125 |title=Förderung von Elektroautos kommt ins Rollen |language=de |trans-title=Promotion of electric cars gets rolling |author=<!--Staff--> |work=KFZ-betrieb |date=2014-08-04 |access-date=2014-08-24 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826165602/http://www.kfz-betrieb.vogel.de/neuwagen/handel/articles/454644/?cmp=nl-125 |archive-date=2014-08-26 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thegreencarwebsite.co.uk/blog/index.php/2014/08/15/germany-plans-new-ev-incentives-to-spur-uptake/|title=Germany plans new EV incentives to spur uptake|first=Faye|last=Sunderland|work=The Green Car Website UK|date=2014-08-15|access-date=2014-08-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826160841/http://www.thegreencarwebsite.co.uk/blog/index.php/2014/08/15/germany-plans-new-ev-incentives-to-spur-uptake/|archive-date=2014-08-26|url-status=dead}}</ref> Not all plug-in hybrids will qualify for the benefits, only those with {{CO2}} emissions of no more than 50 g/km or an [[all-electric range]] of over {{Convert|30|km|abbr=on}} are eligible.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-09-24/germany-proposes-free-parking-to-spur-electric-car-sales |archive-url=https://archive.today/20140925011901/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-09-24/germany-proposes-free-parking-to-spur-electric-car-sales |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-09-25 |title=Germany Proposes Free Parking to Spur Electric-Car Sales |first=Stefan |last=Nicola |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=2014-09-24 |access-date=2014-09-24 }}</ref>

According to the fourth progress report of the German National Electric Mobility Platform, only about 24,000 plug-in electric cars are on German roads by the end of November 2014, well behind the target of 100,000 unit goal set for 2014. As a result, Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] recognized in December 2014 that the government has to provide more incentives to meet the goal of having 1 million electric cars on the country's roads by 2020. Among others, and based on the recommendations of the report, the federal government is considering to offer a tax break for zero-emission company cars, more subsidies to expand charging infrastructure, particularly to deploy more public fast chargers, and more public funding for research and development of the next generation of rechargeable batteries.<ref name=GERincentives2014>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-12-02/merkel-backs-incentives-in-1-million-electric-cars-push |archive-url=https://archive.today/20141207130846/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2014-12-02/merkel-backs-incentives-in-1-million-electric-cars-push |url-status=dead |archive-date=2014-12-07 |title=Merkel Backs Incentives in Push for a Million Electric Cars |first1=Brian |last1=Parkin |first2=Dorothee |last2=Tschampa |work=[[Bloomberg Businessweek]] |date=2014-12-02 |access-date=2014-12-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.dw.de/the-future-is-electric-or-is-it/a-18108847|title=The future is electric – or is it?|first=Sabine |last=Kinkartz|work=[[Deutsche Welle]]|date=2014-12-03|access-date=2014-12-07}}</ref>

An incentive scheme to promote plug-in electric vehicle adoption was approved in April 2016 with a budget of {{euro|1 billion}} ({{USD|1.13 billion}}). A total of {{euro|600 million}} ({{USD|678 million}}) is reserved for the purchase subsidies, which are expected to run until all the money is disbursed, estimated to last until 2019 at the latest. Another {{euro|300 million}} ({{USD|339 million}}) are budgeted to finance the deployment of charging stations in cities and on autobahn highway stops. And another {{euro|100 million}} ({{USD|113 million}}) would go toward purchasing electric cars for federal government fleets. The program is aimed to promote the sale of 400,000 electric vehicles. The cost of the purchase incentive is shared equally between the government and automakers. Electric car buyers get a {{euro|4000}} ({{USD|4520}}) discount while buyers of plug-in hybrid vehicles get a discount of {{euro|3000}} ({{USD|3390}}). Premium cars, such as the [[Tesla Model S]] and [[BMW i8]], are not eligible to the incentive because there is a cap of {{euro|60,000}} ({{USD|67800}}) for the purchase price.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://in.reuters.com/article/autos-electric-germany-discount-idINKCN0XO1Y4 | title=Germany to launch 1 billion-euro discount scheme for electric car buyers | first=Andreas | last=Cremer | work=[[Reuters]] | date=2016-04-27 | access-date=2016-05-14 | archive-date=2016-05-01 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160501200950/http://in.reuters.com/article/autos-electric-germany-discount-idINKCN0XO1Y4 | url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/apr/28/germany-subsidy-boost-electric-car-sales | title=Germany to give €1bn subsidy to boost electric car sales |author=Agence France-Presse | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=2016-04-28 | access-date=2016-05-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.kfz-betrieb.vogel.de/wirtschaft/articles/531213/?cmp=nl-125&uuid=B225CA8F-E6F9-464D-9839-BAB0E10881B8 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20160616183533/http://www.kfz-betrieb.vogel.de/wirtschaft/articles/531213/?cmp=nl-125&uuid=B225CA8F-E6F9-464D-9839-BAB0E10881B8 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2016-06-16 |title=Bis zu 4.000 Euro Förderung für Elektroautos |language=de |trans-title=Up to 4,000 euros in funding for electric cars |author=<!--Staff--> |work=KFZ-betrieb |date=2016-04-27 |access-date=2016-04-14 }}</ref> Only electric vehicles purchased after 18 May 2016 are eligible for the bonus and the owner must keep the new electric car at least nine months.

As a result of the [[economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic]], the government approved in June 2020 an economic recovery plan with a budget of {{euro|130 billion}}, which included {{euro|8 billion}} to promote electric vehicle adoption and deployment of charging infrastructure.<ref name=GerCOVID19>{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-05/germany-s-recovery-fund-gets-green-hue-with-its-focus-on-climate |title=Germany Just Unveiled the World's Greenest Stimulus Plan |author=Laura Millan Lombrana and Akshat Rathi |work=Bloomberg Green |date=2020-06-05 |access-date=2021-01-25}}</ref>

As part of the stimulus plan, the purchase bonus for plug-in electric cars was raised by temporarily doubling the federal contribution of the environmental bonus until the end of 2021. The so-called "innovation bonus" increased the subsidy for new cars costing less than {{euro|40,000}} from {{euro|6,000}} to {{euro|9,000}} for [[all-electric car|fully electric cars]], and for [[plug-in hybrids]] from {{euro|4,500}} to {{euro|6,750}}. This became the highest economic incentive granted in any European country, but there is a holding period, the vehicle must be registered in Germany for at least six months.<ref name=GermanGoals2030/><ref name=GerCOVID19/><ref name=GerBonus2025/>

There are also lower bonuses available for leasing; new cars costing between {{euro|40,000}} and {{euro|65,000}}; and also for used cars, provided no environmental bonus was granted in a previous purchase. In addition, other tax incentives for electric vehicles were introduced. In November 2020 the government decided to keep the innovation bonus until the end of 2025, but for plug-in hybrid cars to be eligible they must have a minimum [[All-electric range|electric range]] of {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}} from 2022 and at least {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} from 2025.<ref name=GerBonus2025>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adac.de/rund-ums-fahrzeug/elektromobilitaet/kaufen/foerderung-elektroautos/|title=Förderung für Elektroautos|website=www.adac.de|date=24 February 2023 }}</ref>

In June 2020, Greek [[Prime Minister of Greece|Prime Minister]] [[Kyriakos Mitsotakis]] announced the government's plan to support the adoption of new [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEV) and [[Plug-in hybrid|plug-in hybrid electric vehicles]] (PHEV) by individuals and corporations, with the aim for one-in-three new vehicles in Greece to be electric by 2030. The plan includes purchase subsidizing, exemption from the [[road tax]] and any parking fees, as well as incentives for setting up charging stations, for [[Battery electric vehicle|pure electric]] private passenger cars and motorbikes, as well as for pure electric or [[Plug-in electric vehicle|plug-in hybrid]] taxis and [[light commercial vehicle]]s. The government's subsidy covers the purchase of new BEVs and PHEVs with a total of 100 million euros for 18 months in the first phase, which is estimated to cover 25% of the cost of about 14.000 new electric vehicles.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Greek PM: Electromobility plan an emblematic initiative for the future|url=https://www.tornosnews.gr/en/tornos/green-travel/40394-greek-pm-electromobility-plan-an-emblematic-initiative-for-the-future.html|access-date=2020-06-16|website=TornosNews.GR|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite web|date=2020-06-05|title=PM Mitsotakis announces incentives for purchase and use of electric cars|url=https://www.keeptalkinggreece.com/2020/06/05/greece-electric-cars-incentives/|access-date=2020-06-16|website=Keep Talking Greece|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite web|last=Capital.gr|title=Πώς θα δοθεί η επιδότηση των 100 εκατ. ευρώ για την ηλεκτροκίνηση|url=https://www.capital.gr/oikonomia/3458924/pos-tha-dothei-i-epidotisi-ton-100-ekat-euro-gia-tin-ilektrokinisi|access-date=2020-06-16|website=Capital.gr|language=el}}</ref>

Other factors contributing to the rapid adoption of plug-in electric vehicles are the relative small size of the country, which reduces [[range anxiety]] (the Netherlands stretches about {{convert|100|mi|abbr=on}} east to west); a long tradition of environmental activism; high gasoline prices ({{USD|8.50}} per gallon as of January 2013), which make the cost of running a car on electricity five times cheaper; and also some EV leasing programs provide free or discounted gasoline-powered vehicles for those who want to take a vacation driving long distances. With all of these incentives and tax breaks, plug-in electric cars have similar driving costs to conventional cars.<ref name=NYT02913/>

Government officials reserved in 1999 the "EL" prefix for exclusive use of all-electric vehicles in order to be able to enforce on the road the benefits available to EVs. As the "EL" series is set to end at "EL 99999" ([[Vehicle registration plates of Norway#Prefixes and sequence numbers|most vehicles in the country have five-digit registration numbers between 10000 and 99999]]), the Norwegian Public Roads agency opted for the prefix "EK" in the second series of plates, to signify "''elektrisk kjøretøy''", Norwegian for electric vehicle. And because the sale of electric vehicles is expected to continue at a rapid pace, meaning that the second phase of license plates is likely to run out as well, the "EV" prefix has been set aside for future electric cars.<ref name=NorskEK>{{cite news| url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2015/08/28/electric-car-craze-keeps-rolling-along/ |title=Electric car craze keeps rolling along |first=Nina |last=Berglund |work=News in English.no |date=2015-08-28 |access-date=2016-03-05}}</ref> In July 2016, as the stock of "EL" prefix plates was almost depleted, the first electric vehicles registered with the new "EK" series were on the road.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.dinside.no/937121/elbil-eller-ladbar-hybrid |title=Elbil eller ladbar hybrid? |language=no |trans-title=BEV or PHEV? |first=Fred Magne |last=Skillebæk |work=Dinside.no |date=2016-08-14 |access-date=2016-08-15 |archive-date=2016-08-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815151932/http://www.dinside.no/937121/elbil-eller-ladbar-hybrid |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name=EKseries>{{cite news | url=http://norwaytoday.info/finance/first-ek-registered-e-cars-road/ | title=The first EK-registered e-cars on the road | first=Stefan | last=Jekic | work=Norway Today | date=2016-07-11 | access-date=2016-08-15}}</ref>

Until June 2013, [[plug-in hybrid]]s were not eligible for these benefits.<ref name="NorIncentives"/><ref name="NORincentives"/> Because the Norwegian tax system levies higher taxes for heavier vehicles, plug-in hybrids were more expensive than similar conventional cars due to the extra weight of the battery pack and its additional electric components.

==== Phase out of incentives ====

In May 2015 the Government decided to keep the existing incentives through 2017, and the political parties in Parliament agreed to reduced and phase out some of the incentives. Beginning in January 2018, electric car owners will be required to pay half of the yearly road license fee and the full rate as of 2020. The value-added tax (VAT) exemption for electric cars will end in 2018, but replaced by a new scheme, which may be subjected to a ceiling that could be reduced as technology develops. The agreement also gave local authorities the right to decide whether electric cars can park for free and use public transport lanes.<ref name=EV2018_1>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/11589548/Norway-to-slash-electric-car-perks-because-its-costing-government-too-much-money.html | title=Norway to slash electric car perks because it's costing government too much money |work=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=2015-05-07|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref><ref name=EV2018_2>{{cite news| url=http://www.dn.no/nyheter/politikkSamfunn/2015/05/06/2226/Bilavgifter/samarbeidspartiene-enige-om-bilavgifter | title= Samarbeidspartiene enige om bilavgifter |language=no| trans-title=Cooperative parties agreed vehicle taxes |work=[[Dagens Næringsliv]] |date=2015-05-06|access-date=2016-03-06}}</ref>

===Portugal===
The Portuguese Government launched in early 2008 a national Programme for Electric Mobility called [[Mobi.E]].<ref>[http://www.mobi-e.pt/ MOBI.E – Rede Nacional de Mobilidade Eléctrica. A energia que nos move] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090726000501/http://www.mobi-e.pt/ |date=2009-07-26 }}. Mobi-e.pt (2010-06-15). Retrieved on 2010-10-14.</ref>

Mobi.E is deploying a national electric mobility system. The system was designed to be scalable and used in multiple geographies, overcoming the current situation of lack of communication among the different electric mobility experiences that are being deployed in Europe. By the first semester of 2011, a wide public network of 1 300 normal and 50 fast charging points will be fully implemented in the main 25 cities of the country.

EVs are fully exempt from both the Vehicle Tax due upon purchase (Imposto Sobre Veículos) and the annual Circulation Tax (Imposto Único de Circulação). Personal income tax provides an allowance of EUR 803 upon the purchase of EVs. EVs are exempt from the 5%-10% company car tax rates which are part of the Corporation Income Tax. The Budget Law provides for an increase of the depreciation costs related to the purchase of EVs for the purpose of Corporation Income Tax.

[[Portugal]] established a government subsidy of €5,000 for the first 5,000 new electric cars sold in the country. In addition, there is in place a €1,500 incentive if the consumer turns in a used car as part of the down payment for the new electric car.<ref name=Portg0510>{{cite news|url=https://jn.sapo.pt/blogs/velocidade/archive/2010/05/17/nissan-j-225-divulgou-pre-231-o-do-carro-el-233-ctrico-leaf.aspx|title=Nissan já divulgou preço do carro eléctrico Leaf|publisher=Journal de Notícias|date=2010-05-17|access-date=2010-05-17|language=pt|url-status=dead|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20100517184611/http%3A//jn.sapo.pt/blogs/velocidade/archive/2010/05/17/nissan%2Dj%2D225%2Ddivulgou%2Dpre%2D231%2Do%2Ddo%2Dcarro%2Del%2D233%2Dctrico%2Dleaf.aspx|archive-date=2010-05-17}}</ref> Electric cars are also exempt from the registration tax.<ref name=ACEA3>{{cite web|url=http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100420_EV_tax_overview.pdf|title=Overview of Tax Incentives for Electric Vehicles in the EU|publisher=[[European Automobile Manufacturers Association]]|date=2010-04-20|access-date=2010-05-18|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611201348/http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/20100420_EV_tax_overview.pdf|archive-date=2011-06-11}}</ref>

Two alternative proposals are being considered by the Swedish government regarding the introduction of a [[bonus-malus]] system. Both proposals entail changes to vehicle and car benefit taxation and the premium system for purchases of new cars. An official inquiry report was due by 29 April 2016. The goal is for the system to enter into force on 1 January 2017.<ref name=Subisdies2015_2020/>
The new bonus-malus system, starting 1 July 2018, will offer electric car buyers a bonus of {{SEK|60,000}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transportstyrelsen.se/sv/vagtrafik/Fordon/bonus-malus/|title=Bonus malus-system för personbilar, lätta lastbilar och lätta bussar – Transportstyrelsen|website=www.transportstyrelsen.se}}</ref>

The bonus of {{SEK|70,000}} offered to electric car buyers was abolished in November 2022 by the new right-wing government.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}}

===Switzerland===
Switzerland has a car import tax which is 4% of the purchase price (before adding the VAT) which is waived for electric cars.<ref name=ezv>{{cite web|url=http://www.ezv.admin.ch/zollinfo_privat/04392/04393/04394/index.html?lang=de|title=Eidgenössische Zollverwaltung|date=2013-05-21|access-date=2014-03-08|archive-date=2014-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308090139/http://www.ezv.admin.ch/zollinfo_privat/04392/04393/04394/index.html?lang=de|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=xtares>{{Cite web|url=http://xtares.admin.ch|title=swiss customs database}}</ref> Since [[Switzerland]] consists of [[cantons of Switzerland|26&nbsp;cantons]] which have their own legislature, additional incentives for plug-in electric vehicles differ between the respective regions. The current list can be downloaded from the website of the Swiss Department of Energy.<ref name=bfe>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfe.admin.ch/energieetikette/00886/02038/index.html?lang=de&dossier_id=02083|title=Bundesamt für Energie|date=2014-02-04}}</ref>

There are no additional incentives on the actual purchase price, but some cantons offer road tax cuts. The Swiss road tax is a yearly recurring fixed amount calculated based on the specifications of the tax payers car. Currently, only the cantons [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]] (GL), [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]] (SO), [[Ticino]] (TI) and [[Canton of Zurich|Zurich]] (ZH) are completely waiving the tax for plug-in electric vehicles.

;Calculation example for [[Canton of Zurich|Zurich]]

Based on a usual car with the following specification:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stva.zh.ch/internet/sicherheitsdirektion/stva/de/StVAgeb/GEBva14/VArechner.html|title=Verkehrsabgabenrechner|work=zh.ch|date=21 March 2025 }}</ref>
* Engine: 2 L
* Total weight: 1800&nbsp;kg
* Energy efficiency: C
* Year: 2013

The resulting tax to be paid per year will be {{CHF|278}}. Hence when calculating with a life expectancy of 10 years, the car owner in this example might save around {{CHF|2,780}} when buying a plug-in electric car.

However, since the [[Fuel tax|tax on fossil fuels]] are relatively high in all European countries, including Switzerland, there is still an indirect, but quite strong incentive for car buyers to decide for energy efficient vehicles.

Based on the following examples:
* Fuel economy: {{Convert|7.8|L/100km|mpgUS|abbr=on}} unleaded
* Driving habits: {{Convert|15000|km|abbr=on}} per year
* Fuel tax: {{CHF| 0.7312}} per liter ({{CHF|2.7679}} per gallon)
* Carbon tax (since January 1, 2014): {{CHF|0.1414}} per liter ({{CHF|0.5353}} per gallon)

The resulting taxes on the burned fuels will be around {{CHF|1,021}} per year, which results in {{CHF|10,210}} over the car's 10-year lifetime.

* Crash safety: To make sure cars will be safe in a crash, they must either have: EC whole vehicle type approval (EC WVTA, not small series) or evidence that the car has appropriate levels of safety as judged by international standards.

In February 2015 the government announced that to take account of rapidly developing technology, and the growing range of ULEVs on the British market, the criteria for the plug-in car grant was updated and from April 2015, eligible ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs) must meet criteria in one of the following categories depending on emission levels and zero-emission-capable mileage, with a technology neutral approach, which means that [[fuel cell vehicle|hydrogen fuel cell cars]] are also eligible for the grant:<ref name=DfT/><ref name=Grant2015/>
* Category 1: {{CO2}} emissions of less than 50g/km and a zero emission range of at least {{Convert|70|mi|abbr=on}}.
* Category 2: {{CO2}} emissions of less than 50g/km and a zero emission range between {{Convert|10|and|69|mi|abbr=on}}.
* Category 3: {{CO2}} emissions of 50–75g/km and a zero emission range of at least {{Convert|20|mi|abbr=on}}.

In December 2015, the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) announced that Plug-in car grant was extended until March 2018 to encourage more than 100,000 UK motorists to buy cleaner vehicles. A total funding of {{GBP|400 million}} (~{{USD|600 million}}) is available for the extension. To reflect the changes in the British market, the criteria for the Plug-in Car Grant was updated and the maximum grant drops from {{GBP|5,000}} (~{{USD|7,450}}) to {{GBP|4,500}} (~{{USD|6,700}}). For the extension, the amount of the grant is linked in directly with the Office for Low Emission Vehicles three vehicle categories issued in April 2015. The eligible ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs) must meet criteria in one of three categories depending on emission levels ({{CO2}} emissions bands between 50 and 75g/km) and zero-emission-capable mileage (minimum of {{Convert|10|mi|abbr=on}}), with a technology neutral approach, which means that [[fuel cell vehicle|hydrogen fuel cell cars]] are eligible for the grant.<ref name=Grant2015/><ref name=Extension2018>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/17/plug-in-car-grant-extended-to-2018 |title=Plug-in car grant extended to 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2015-12-17|access-date=2015-12-20}}</ref><ref name=Extension2018_2>{{cite web|url=http://www.nextgreencar.com/news/7409/extension-announced-for-plugin-car-grant/ |title=Extension announced for Plug-in Car Grant|first=Chris |last=Lilly|publisher=Next Green Car|location=UK |date=2015-12-17|access-date=2015-12-20}}</ref> The updated scheme went into force on 1 March 2016.<ref name=Extension2018_2/>

====Plugged-in Places====
On 19 November 2009, [[Andrew Adonis]], the [[Secretary of State for Transport]], announced a scheme called "Plugged-in-Places", making available £30 million to be shared between three and six cities to investigate further the viability of providing power supply for electric vehicles, and encouraging local government and business to participate and bid for funds.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.which.co.uk/news/2009/11/thousands-of-electric-car-charging-points-due-189176|publisher=[[Which?]]|date=2009-11-20|access-date=2009-11-22|title=Thousands of electric car charging points due|archive-date=2009-11-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122125813/http://www.which.co.uk/news/2009/11/thousands-of-electric-car-charging-points-due-189176|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The UK government is supporting the "Plugged-In Places" program to install vehicle recharging points across the UK. The scheme offers match-funding to consortia of businesses and public sector partners to support the installation of EV recharging infrastructure in lead places across the UK.<ref name=DfT2>{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/sustainable/olev/recharging-electric-vehicles/|title=Recharging infrastructure|publisher=[[Department for Transport]]|access-date=2011-12-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222024540/http://www.dft.gov.uk/topics/sustainable/olev/recharging-electric-vehicles/|archive-date=2011-12-22|url-status=dead}}</ref> There are eight Plugged-In Places:East of England;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sourceeast.net/ |title=Source East |publisher=Source East |access-date=2012-03-30}}</ref> Greater Manchester; London;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sourcelondon.net/ |title=Source London |publisher=Source London |date=2011-11-05 |access-date=2012-03-30}}</ref> Midlands;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cenex.co.uk/programmes/plugged-in-places|title=Plugged-in-Places|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110825170205/http://www.cenex.co.uk/programmes/plugged-in-places|archive-date=2011-08-25}}</ref> Milton Keynes;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chargemasterplc.com/charging-schemes/milton-keynes/ |title=Milton Keynes « ChargeMaster |publisher=Chargemasterplc.com |access-date=2012-03-30 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316101205/http://chargemasterplc.com/charging-schemes/milton-keynes/ |archive-date=2012-03-16 }}</ref> North East;

====London congestion charge====
[[Battery electric vehicles|All-electric vehicle]]s (BEVs) and eligible [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s (PHEVs) qualify for a 100% discount from the [[London congestion charge]]. A plug-in electric drive vehicle qualifies if the vehicle is registered with the [[Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency]] (DVLA) and has a fuel type of 'electric', or alternatively, if the vehicle is a 'plug-in hybrid' and is on the Government's list of PHEVs eligible for the OLEV grant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tfl.gov.uk/modes/driving/congestion-charge/discounts-and-exemptions?intcmp=4368|title=Discounts and exemptions – Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED)|publisher=[[Transport for London]] |date=February 2015|access-date=2015-02-15}} ''Click on "Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED)" for details.''</ref> {{As of|2015|02}}, approved PHEVs include all extended-range cars such as the [[BMW i3 REx|BMW i3 with range extender]] and [[Vauxhall Ampera]], and plug-in hybrids that emit 75g/km or less of {{CO2}} and that meet the [[Euro 5]] standard for air quality, such as the [[Audi A3 Sportback e-tron]], [[BMW i8]], [[Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV]], and [[Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goultralow.com/what-are-go-ultra-low-cars/types-of-vehicles/plug-in-hybrid/|title=Vehicle technologies – Plug-in hybrids|publisher=Go Ultra Low|date=February 2015|access-date=2015-02-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416230722/https://www.goultralow.com/what-are-go-ultra-low-cars/types-of-vehicles/plug-in-hybrid/|archive-date=2015-04-16|url-status=dead}}</ref>

The original Greener Vehicle Discount was substituted by the Ultra Low Emission Discount (ULED) scheme that went into effect on 1 July 2013. The ULED introduced more stringent emission standards that limited the free access to the congestion charge zone to any car or van that emits 75g/km or less of CO<sub>2</sub> and meets the [[Euro 5]] emission standards for air quality. {{As of|2013|07}} there are no [[internal combustion]]-only vehicles that meet these criteria. The measure is designed to limit the growing number of diesel vehicles on London's roads. [[Mayor Boris Johnson]] approved the new scheme in April 2013, after taking into account a number of comments received during the 12-week public consultation that took place. About 20,000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three-year [[Sunset provision|sunset period]] (until 24 June 2016) before they have to pay the full congestion charge.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2013/04/uled-20130424.html |title=London to introduce new Ulta Low Emission Discount for Congestion Charge scheme; countering dieselization |publisher=Green Car Congress  |date=2013-04-24 |access-date=2013-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/apr/24/pollution|title=London tightens up congestion charge in attempt to drive out diesel |work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2013-04-24|access-date=2013-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreencarwebsite.co.uk/blog/index.php/2013/07/01/london-tightens-congestion-charge-exemptions/ |title=London tightens Congestion Charge exemptions |first=Faye |last=Sunderland |publisher=The Green Car Website |location=UK |date=2013-07-01 |access-date=2013-07-01 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216062939/http://www.thegreencarwebsite.co.uk/blog/index.php/2013/07/01/london-tightens-congestion-charge-exemptions/ |archive-date=2015-02-16 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-23125082|title=New green discount for the congestion charge comes in |work=[[BBC News]]|date=2013-07-01|access-date=2013-07-02}}</ref>

Effective from 8 April 2019, the ULED scheme will be replaced with the Cleaner Vehicle Discount. This means that from April 2019, only vehicles which are Euro 6, emit up to 75g/km of {{Co2}} and have a minimum 20 mile zero emission range, will qualify for the discount. A further phase from October 2021 will mean that only [[zero-emission vehicle]]s ([[battery electric vehicle|pure electric vehicles]] and [[fuel cell vehicle|hydrogen fuel cell vehicles]]) will qualify for the discount, which will be phased out completely from December 2025.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/decisions/md2397-amendments-congestion-charge-and-ultra-low-emission-zone|title=Mayoral Decision 2397: Amendments to the Congestion Charge and Low Emission Zone|date=17 December 2018|website=Greater London Authority (GLA)|access-date=2019-01-17}}</ref> Edit summary (Briefly describe your changes) By publishing changes, you agree to the Terms of Use , and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and the GFDL .
