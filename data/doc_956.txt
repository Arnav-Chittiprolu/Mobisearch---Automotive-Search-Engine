This category contains disambiguation pages :  non-article pages containing links to other Wikipedia articles and disambiguation pages. Disambiguation pages are added to Category:Disambiguation pages by placing the {{ Disambiguation }} template on the page itself. Other templates are available that place articles in more specific disambiguation subcategories. A page will also be auto- assessed on WikiProjects as "disambiguation-class" if a disambiguation template is found on it. This places the talk page in a subcategory of Category:Disambig-Class pages . Notes Do not include this category manually in articles; the {{ Disambiguation }} template automatically does this. Do not add articles to these sub-categories or create additional sub-categories until you read Manual of Style (disambiguation pages) —most of the sub-categories do not comply with the MOS and will be removed. Links to disambiguation pages other than from the top of articles are usually mistakes. Find and fix them at disambiguation pages with links . Wikimedia Commons has media related to Disambiguation . Lists of disambiguation pages: Links to disambiguating pages Links to (disambiguation) pages Multiple-place names Disambiguation pages can include links to Wiktionary , using {{ wiktionary }} .
