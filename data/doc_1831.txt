Any such material should be removed , and content with an unencyclopedic tone should be rewritten. ( October 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Market operators continue to operate in the NSE, albeit within a regulatory framework aimed at ensuring transparency and fairness. Market operators are individuals or entities that actively engage in buying and selling securities to influence their prices for profit. They operate through various strategies, such as arbitrage, short selling , high-frequency trading , front running , churning , scalping , wash trading , spoofing, and layering, often leveraging sophisticated technology and large capital. Regulatory bodies like the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) oversee market activities to curb malpractices such as insider trading , price rigging, and market manipulation . SEBI has implemented measures, including surveillance systems, to detect and penalize unethical practices. Despite these regulations, market operators exploit loopholes to gain an edge, necessitating continuous vigilance and regulatory updates. Market operators often use the pump and dump strategy, despite strict regulations against such practices. This scheme involves artificially inflating the price of a stock through false or misleading positive statements. Once the price has been significantly raised, the operators then sell off their holdings at the inflated prices, leading to a sharp price decline and substantial losses for other investors who bought in at the higher prices. Their activities have continued to impact market volatility, liquidity, and price discovery, playing a significant role in the dynamics of NSE.
