Bayern Munich won the next two Audi Cups, beating Manchester City 2–1 in the 2013 final and Real Madrid 1–0 in 2015. Atlético Madrid claimed the title in 2017 with a victory on penalties after a 1–1 draw with Liverpool , before Tottenham Hotspur also required penalties against Bayern Munich to win their first Audi Cup in 2019.
