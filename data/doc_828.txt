The Linguistic Society of Hong Kong Cantonese Romanization Scheme , [ a ] also known as Jyutping , is a romanisation system for Cantonese developed in 1993 by the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong (LSHK). The name Jyutping (itself the Jyutping romanisation of its Chinese name, 粵拼 ) is a contraction of the official name, and it consists of the first Chinese characters of the terms jyut6 jyu5 ( Chinese : 粵語 ; lit. ' Cantonese language ') and ping3 jam1 ( Chinese : 拼音 ; lit. 'phonetic alphabet'; pronounced pīnyīn in Mandarin ). Despite being intended as a system to indicate pronunciation, it has also been employed in writing Cantonese as an alphabetic language [ zh ] —in effect, elevating Jyutping from its assistive status to a written language.

[ 2 ] In 2018, it was updated to include the -a and -oet finals, to reflect syllables recognized as part of Cantonese phonology in 1997 by the Jyutping Work Group of the Linguistic Society of Hong Kong.

Tones [ edit ] Main article: Cantonese phonology § Tones There are nine tones in six distinct tone contours in Cantonese. However, as three of the nine are entering tones ( 入聲 ; jap6 sing1 ), which only appear in syllables ending with p , t , and k , they do not have separate tone numbers in Jyutping (though they do in the ILE romanization of Cantonese ; these are shown in parentheses in the table below). A mnemonic which some use to remember this is 風水到時我哋必發達 ; fung1 seoi2 dou3 si4 ngo5 dei6 bit1 faat3 daat6 or " Feng Shui [dictates that] we will be lucky."

The vowel : aa (except when used alone), a , e , i , o , u , yu . The nasal stop : m , ng . The coda : i , u , m , n , ng , p , t , k . But they differ in the following: The vowels eo and oe represent /ɵ/ and /œː/ respectively in Jyutping, whereas the eu represents both vowels in Yale. The initial j represents /j/ in Jyutping whereas y is used instead in Yale. The initial z represents /ts/ in Jyutping whereas j is used instead in Yale. The initial c represents /tsʰ/ in Jyutping whereas ch is used instead in Yale. In Jyutping, if no consonant precedes the vowel yu , then the initial j is appended before the vowel. In Yale, the corresponding initial y is never appended before yu under any circumstances. Jyutping defines five finals not in Yale: a /ɐ/ , eu /ɛːu/ , em /ɛːm/ , ep /ɛːp/ , oet /œːt/ .  These finals are used in colloquial Cantonese words, such as deu6 ( 掉 ), lem2 ( 舐 ), and gep6 ( 夾 ). To represent tones , only tone numbers are used in Jyutping whereas Yale traditionally uses tone marks together with the letter h (though tone numbers can be used in Yale as well). Comparison with ILE romanisation [ edit ] Jyutping and ILE romanisation represent Cantonese pronunciations with the same letters in: The initials : b , p , m , f , d , t , n , l , g , k , ng , h , s , gw , kw , j , w . The vowel : aa , a , e , i , o , u . The nasal stop : m , ng . The coda : i (except for its use in the coda /y/ in Jyutping; see below), u , m , n , ng , p , t , k . But they have some differences: The vowel oe represents both /ɵ/ and /œː/ in ILE whereas eo and oe represent /ɵ/ and /œː/ respectively in Jyutping. The vowel y represents /y/ in ILE whereas both yu (used in the nucleus ) and i (used in the coda of the final - eoi ) are used in Jyutping. The initial dz represents /ts/ in ILE whereas z is used instead in Jyutping. The initial ts represents /tsʰ/ in ILE whereas c is used instead in Jyutping. To represent tones , the numbers 1 to 9 are usually used in ILE, although the use of 1, 3, 6 to replace 7, 8, 9 for the checked tones is acceptable. However, only the numbers 1 to 6 are used in Jyutping.

Jyutping input method [ edit ] A Jyutping input methods allows a user to input Chinese characters by entering the Jyutping romanization of a Chinese character (with or without tone, depending on the system) and then presenting the user with a list of possible characters with that pronunciation. As of macOS Ventura and iOS 16 , Jyutping input in traditional Chinese characters is a built-in functionality on Mac under the name "Phonetic – Cantonese" and on iPhone and iPad under the name "Cantonese".
