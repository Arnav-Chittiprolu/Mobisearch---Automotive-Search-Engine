It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages , or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories (except for eponymous maintenance categories). This is a tracking category . It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme . This category is hidden on its member pages —unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. These categories can be used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse " (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list ( discriminated by classifications ). This category combines all articles with failed verification from February 2012 (2012-02) to enable us to work through the backlog more systematically. It is a member of Category:Articles with failed verification . To add an article to this category add {{ Failed verification |date=February 2012}} to the article. If you omit the date a bot will add it for you at some point. Pages in category "Articles with failed verification from February 2012" The following 19 pages are in this category, out of  19 total.
