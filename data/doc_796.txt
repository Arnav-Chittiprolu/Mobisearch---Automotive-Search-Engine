[ 1 ] The company plans an initial production run of 30 cars, with a starting price of $465,000. [ 2 ] Presentation [ edit ] The Laffite X-Road is the fruit of the partnership of several companies. [ 3 ] Laffite Supercars, founded by Bruno Laffite, the nephew of racing driver Jacques Laffite , is responsible for the creation of the vehicle. "G-TEC", [ 4 ] a company led by engineer Philippe Gautheron, created the entire chassis and running gear. Anthony Jannarelly, founder of Jannarelly Automotive and designer of Lykan HyperSport , took care of the exterior design. Team Virage Group tested and refined the settings of the concept. [ 5 ] The origin of the project dates back to 2015 with the presentation of the buggy Zarooq SandRacer 500GT , which was to be produced in 2017. [ 6 ] While that project was abandoned, Bruno Laffite, former director of operations for Zarooq Motors, relaunched the project with the help of Anthony Jannarelly, who designed the SandRacer 500GT. [ 7 ] Technical characteristics [ edit ] The luxury buggy rests on a tubular chassis in chromium-molybdenum steel and is 4.29 meters long and 2.14 meters wide for a mass of 1.3 tons. [ 8 ] The interior of the cabin is lined with leather and touches of carbon fiber and aluminum. The X-Road has 17 inch rims fitted with BF Goodrich tires, and its suspensions accept a 450 mm travel. [ 9 ] The X-Road will use a V8 LS3 engine from General Motors , which will deliver up to 720 hp (540 kW) with a compressor, with a displacement of 6,162 cm 3 (376.0 cu in). The engine is mated to a five-speed or six-speed sequential gearbox with paddles on the steering wheel, all distributing power to the rear wheels. [ 10 ] The X-Road offers the possibility of choosing a 460 hp (340 kW) electric motor powered by a 60 kWh lithium-ion battery, with a range of 322 km. The weight of the electric version is 1.63 tons. [ 11 ] This version will cost $545,000. [ 12 ] References [ edit ] ^ Gaël Angleviel (19 January 2020). "Laffite G-Tec X-Road, une supercar tout-terrain" . AAAfranceracing.frAAA .
