From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Bunsen's cell The Bunsen cell is a zinc-carbon primary cell (colloquially called a "battery") composed of a zinc anode in dilute sulfuric acid separated by a porous pot from a carbon cathode in nitric or chromic acid . Cell details [ edit ] The Bunsen cell generates about 1.9 volts which arises from the following reaction: [ 1 ] Zn + H 2 SO 4 + 2 HNO 3 ⇌ ZnSO 4 + 2 H 2 O + 2 NO 2 (g) According to the reaction above, when 1 mole (or part) each of zinc and sulfuric acid react with 2 moles (or parts) of nitric acid , the resultant products formed are, 1 mole (or part) of zinc sulfate and 2 moles (or parts) each of water and nitrogen dioxide ( gaseous , in the form of bubbles). [ citation needed ] The cell is named after its inventor, German chemist Robert Wilhelm Bunsen , who improved upon the Grove cell by replacing Grove 's expensive platinum cathode with carbon in the form of pulverized coal and coke . Like Grove's battery, Bunsen's emitted noxious fumes of nitrogen dioxide . [ citation needed ] Bunsen used this cell to extract metals. Henri Moissan used a stack of 90 cells for the electrolysis of hydrogen fluoride to obtain fluorine for the first time.
