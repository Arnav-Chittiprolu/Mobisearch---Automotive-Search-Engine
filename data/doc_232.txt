In general, keep it concise (under 2 lines), refrain from fancy formatting , and new entries should be placed at the top of their section. Before editing, make sure you are on Wikipedia:Community bulletin board , not Wikipedia:Community portal , where the board is transcluded. Events and projects : In this section, only organized events, projects, and/or competitions should be listed. These are organized by how often they occur: The Yearly section is for uncommon events, like events that only occur every year, once, or irregularly. The Monthly section is for events that occur each month, or are always ongoing. WikiProject notices : In this section, any announcement, request for help or other notice from a WikiProject should be listed here. Entries should be signed, and ordered from newest to oldest.

Troubleshooting Wikipedia's look and feel with skins Wikipedia should function and look right in any web browser . However, depending on the layout of an individual page and the Wikipedia skin set in your User preferences , a page layout might be broken in your browser. If the problem occurs on a single page, edit the page to fix it yourself. If you cannot fix it, put a message on the Talk page for the page (a screenshot always helps!).
