It remains part of IHI's business activities, although it has been diluted through several mergers with other Japanese shipbuilding companies. [ 14 ] In 1960, Ishikawajima Heavy Industries merged with Harima Shipbuilding & Engineering Company to establish the Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries (IHI). IHI built Mutsu , Japan's first nuclear powered ship with reactors from Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in 1969. [ 15 ] In 1995, Marine United was established jointly with Sumitomo Heavy Industries .  
In 2013, IHI Marine United was merged with Universal Shipbuilding Corporation owned by the steel company JFE Holdings in order to newly establish a larger firm, Japan Marine United Corporation (JMU), of which IHI remained a shareholder. In March 2020, Japan Marine United (with 49% of shares) agreed to merge with Imabari Shipbuilding (with 51% of shares) into a joint venture named Nihon Shipyard (NSY), covering all ship types except Liquefied natural gas (LNG) tankers. [ 16 ] This agreement became effective in January 2021.
In parallel with the creation of Nihon Shipyard, Imabari Shipbuilding bought 30% of JMU's shares, while IHI and JFE Holdings each kept 35% of JMU's capital. 
The merger between these two Japanese companies resulted in Nihon Shipyard becoming one of the largest marine-engineering and shipbuilding companies in the world, of which IHI remains a shareholder.
