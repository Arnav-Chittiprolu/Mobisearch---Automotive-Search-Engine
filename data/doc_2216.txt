[ 1 ] [ 2 ] The company was founded as Host Kilmer Service Centres , a joint venture between international hospitality company HMSHost (a subsidiary of Autogrill ) and Kilmer van Nostrand (an investment company owned by Canadian businessman Larry Tanenbaum ). [ 3 ] ONroute was acquired by Arjun Infrastructure Partners and Fengate Asset Management in May 2019. [ 4 ] [ 1 ] The "ONroute" brand name is a modified version of the French phrase "en route", using the province's postal abbreviation of "ON". History [ edit ] Construction of Ontario Highways 400 and 401 began in the early 1950s, with the last section of 401 completed in 1968. Both roads were intended as bypasses, going around populated areas instead of through them (the highways 11 / 27 and 2 which they replaced were Main Street in nearly every served community) and therefore initially had few services. A series of rest stops was constructed as part of the highway in the 1960s in rural areas to provide a full-service restaurant (later replaced with franchised fast food ) and a service station (eventually curtailed to fuel only, no repair services). All but a few of these dated from the same era with strong similarity in design. In line with the 400-series Highways being fully controlled-access, all of these service centres allow general access by freeway entry/exit only and do not connect to adjacent roads, even those located in cities. Some of these urban service centres may have restricted access to surface streets, during construction, and on an ongoing basis for staff, suppliers deliveries, and waste disposal. The only exception was the Cookstown service centre, which was directly connected to Highway 89 (a surface street) as well as the Highway 400 freeway since the centre was located at their interchange. The Cookstown service centre closed on February 1, 2013 in order to accommodate reconfiguration of the interchange ramps, being replaced by a new service centre (Innisfil ONRoute) on Highway 400 north of Fourth Line which opened in June 2015. [ 5 ] The rest areas on Highway 401 at Ingersoll and Newcastle (both serving only the westbound carriageway) and the Highway 400 rest area in Maple (Vaughan) (serving southbound traffic only) were rebuilt in the late 1990s, ahead of the other remaining rest areas being tendered to HKSC for redevelopment, and as their design is sufficiently modern they remain in operation. Unlike all other rest areas, Esso remains as the gasoline distributor at these locations, which also includes a convenience store by Circle K . All these locations have currently been replaced with Canadian Tire Gas+ as of 2025. The Highway 400 rest area in Maple (Vaughan) (serving southbound traffic only) has closed as of April 21, 2025 for reconstruction. [ 6 ] From the late 1980s to 2010, rest areas on the two highways were operated by Scott's Hospitality, a major publicly traded Canadian restaurant operator.  In 1999 Scott's was acquired by John Bitove 's Obelysk Inc and the highway centers were sold to HMS Host Marriott in 2005.  Shortly thereafter the government of Ontario tendered all 17 highway centres to rebuild and operate on a new long term contract.  In 2010 HKSC was selected as the new operator for all of its rest areas [ 3 ] Since 2010–11, HKSC has demolished the 1960s-era rest stops, leaving most rest stops out of operation for a year or more, and used the sites to construct new ONroute service stations. Most of the remaining redevelopment projects were completed in 2013. [ 3 ] Partners in the redevelopment projects included EllisDon Construction , Quadrangle , and Bruce Mau Design . [ 7 ] All of the redeveloped locations were designed to meet the LEED certification standards of the Canadian Green Building Council , as well as current standards of accessibility for travellers with disabilities. [ 7 ] On June 13, 2019, HMS Host announced the sale of all 23 ONroute centres to Arjun Infrastructure and Fengate Asset Management. [ 8 ] Arjun is a British company which is the minority shareholder in the similar Welcome Break chain of motorway service areas in the United Kingdom, while Fengate is a Canadian asset management firm. In 2020, seating areas were temporarily closed to prevent the spread of COVID-19 . [ 9 ] They were reopened during Stage 3 of the Ontario government's reopening plan. In December 2021, Caroline Mulroney and Todd Smith announced that 17 of the 23 stations would have charging stations for electric vehicles installed by mid 2022, and three more by the end of 2022. They will be installed by Ivy, a joint venture between Hydro One and Ontario Power Generation at a cost of $11.5 million. [ 10 ] Services [ edit ] Canadian Tire gas station at ONroute Cambridge South ONroute Cambridge North with limited seating and mandatory masks for patrons during the COVID-19 pandemic ONroute locations by HKSC feature a Canadian Tire or Petro-Canada gas station, a Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce ATM, and a 24-hour convenience store called ON Market. While each location offers a different selection of fast food providers, all locations feature a Tim Hortons together with some combination of A&W , Big Smoke Burger , Brioche Dorée , Burger King , Cinnabon , East Side Mario's Pronto , Extreme Pita , KFC , Taco Bell , Mr. Sub , New York Fries , Pizza Pizza , PurBlendz, Starbucks , Swiss Chalet , Wendy's or Yogen Früz outlets. [ 11 ] In some cases, selection at the food outlets is more limited or prices higher than in non-highway locations of the same-brand chains. Many of the smaller brands no longer operate on the ONroute network. As of August 2025, the brands that remain include: Tim Hortons A&W Burger King Booster Juice Gas+ Petro-Canada ON Market New York Fries Starbucks Subway Wendy's Popeyes All ONroute locations have free Wi-Fi . [ 12 ] In addition, the westernmost (Tilbury) and easternmost (Bainsville) locations along Highway 401 also feature Ontario Tourist Information Centres, as they serve as gateway locations for tourists entering the province from Michigan and Quebec respectively. [ 7 ] Locations [ edit ] Map of ONroute locations There are 19 ONroute locations sited along Highway 401 and currently three located on the southern section of Highway 400 between Toronto and Barrie (southbound at Innisfil , with a fourth – a second southbound location – under construction in Vaughan as of June 2025 to replace the non-ONRoute branded Maple service centre, and northbound at King City and Barrie).
