From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Battery that serves a structural function Structural batteries are multifunctional materials or structures , capable of acting as an electrochemical energy storage system (i.e. batteries ) while possessing mechanical integrity . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] They help save weight and are useful in transport applications [ 4 ] [ 5 ] such as electric vehicles and drones , [ 6 ] because of their potential to improve system efficiencies. Two main types of structural batteries can be distinguished: embedded batteries and laminated structural electrodes. [ 7 ] Embedded batteries [ edit ] Embedded batteries represent multifunctional structures where lithium-ion battery cells are efficiently embedded into a composite structure , and more often sandwich structures .  In a sandwich design, state-of-the-art lithium-ion batteries are embedded forming a core material and bonded in between two thin and strong face sheets (e.g. aluminium). In-plane and bending loads are carried by face sheets while the battery core takes up transverse shear and compression loads as well as storing the electrical energy . The multifunctional structure can then be used as a load-bearing as well as an energy storage material. [ 8 ] Laminated structural electrodes [ edit ] In laminated structural electrodes the electrode material possesses an intrinsic load-bearing and energy storage function. Such batteries are also called massless  batteries , since in theory vehicle body parts could also store energy thus not adding any additional weight to the vehicle as additional batteries would not be needed. [ 9 ] An example for such batteries are those based on a zinc anode , manganeseoxide cathode and a fiber/ polymer composite electrolyte . [ 10 ] The structural electrolyte enables stable charge and discharge performance. This assembly has been demonstrated in an unmanned aerial vehicle . A commonly proposed structural battery is based on a carbon fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP) concept. Here, carbon fibers serve simultaneously as electrodes and structural reinforcement. The lamina is composed of carbon fibers that are embedded in a matrix material (e.g. a polymer ). Multiple layers of carbon fibers are impregnated with a matrix that enables load transfer between the fibers but also lithium-ion transport, unlike commonly used vinylester or epoxy matrices. This type of energy storage system can be based on a nickel [ 11 ] or on lithium-ion chemistry. [ 12 ] The laminate is made of the combination of a negative electrode , a separator and a positive electrode , embedded in an ionically conductive and structural electrolyte . In the laminated structural electrodes concept, carbon fibers can be used to intercalate e.g. lithium-ions (structural anode ); similarly, to commercially available graphite anodes. The structural cathode consists of carbon fibers coated with electrochemically active species, e.g. lithium oxide particles. An example of a structural battery exploiting a carbon fiber negative electrode and lithium iron phosphate positive electrode was demonstrated to be capable of lighting an LED . [ 13 ] Some separator material is used in between the two structural electrodes to prevent short-circuits . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] However, the CFRC concept described above is still being researched.
