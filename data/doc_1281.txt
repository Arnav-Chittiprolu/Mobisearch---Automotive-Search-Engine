===Drivetrain===
====Quad-Motor====
The initial version of the R1T features four electric motors, one on each wheel, that combine to produce {{cvt|835|hp}} and deliver {{cvt|908|ftlb|Nm}} of torque.<ref name=ars20210928/><!-- combined torque & hp cannot just be added from addition of the axle torques & hps --> Each motor is an [[Alternating current|AC]] [[permanent magnet motor]]<ref name=insideevs20210928>{{cite news |last=Moloughney |first=Tom |title=2022 Rivian R1T First Drive Review: Electric Off-Road Dominance |work=InsideEVs |date=September 28, 2021 |url=https://insideevs.com/reviews/536129/2022-rivian-r1t-first-drive-review/ |access-date=October 5, 2021 |archive-date=October 5, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211005032745/https://insideevs.com/reviews/536129/2022-rivian-r1t-first-drive-review/ |url-status=live }}</ref> designed by [[Robert Bosch GmbH]] and produced by Rivian under license.<ref name=IEVs-20230224/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/rivian-will-speed-factory-flow-making-its-own-motors |title=Rivian shifts to in-house motors to boost production |author=Iliff, Laurence |date=April 14, 2023 |work=Automotive News |url-access=subscription |access-date=May 30, 2023}}</ref> The front two motors produce {{cvt|415|hp}} and {{cvt|413|ftlb|Nm}} of torque while the rear two motors produce {{cvt|420|hp}} and {{cvt|495|ftlb|Nm}} of torque.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Gold|first=Aaron|date=August 31, 2021|title=The 2022 Rivian R1T Is the Most Remarkable Pickup We've Ever Driven|url=https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2022-rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-truck-first-drive-review/|access-date=September 13, 2021|website=MotorTrend|language=en-US|archive-date=September 15, 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210915222549/https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2022-rivian-r1t-electric-pickup-truck-first-drive-review/|url-status=live}}</ref> The four motors are carried near the centerline of the chassis and use [[direct-drive]] [[transaxle]]s to each wheel;<ref name="mtrend20210913">{{cite news |date=September 13, 2021 |title=Exclusive: We Drive the Rivian R1T Off-Road Across America, Part 2 |url=https://www.motortrend.com/features/2022-rivian-r1t-exclusive-drive-review-trans-atlantic-trail-off-road-part-2/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210924004539/https://www.motortrend.com/features/2022-rivian-r1t-exclusive-drive-review-trans-atlantic-trail-off-road-part-2/ |archive-date=September 24, 2021 |access-date=October 11, 2021 |work=[[Motor Trend]]}}</ref> the quad-motor setup allows the use of a [[torque vectoring]] wheel control system, which senses slip on each wheel with millisecond granularity and responds by "distribut[ing] the proper amount of power to each wheel, precisely as needed."<ref name=insideevs20210928/>

====Dual-Motor====
In March 2022, Rivian announced it would develop and sell a dual-motor powertrain for the R1T, with one electric motor for each axle. The price of the dual-motor (DM) version would start around the same initial price at which the quad-motor (QM) version was offered, while the QM version would increase in price by almost 20%. The output of the DM version was expected to be more than {{cvt|600|hp}} and {{cvt|600|lbft}} of torque,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/rivian-dual-motor-r1s-r1t-launch-quad-motor-price-increase/ |title=Rivian Launches 600-HP Dual-Motor R1S and R1T, Raises Quad-Motor Pricing |author=Golson, Daniel |date=March 1, 2022 |work=Road/Show |publisher=CNet |access-date=May 26, 2023}}</ref> but was later published by Rivian at {{cvt|533|hp}} and {{cvt|610|lbft}} of torque.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://stories.rivian.com/difference-between-r1-drive-systems | title=Rivian Drive Systems, Decoded - Rivian Stories }}</ref> The largest ("Max") battery was removed as an option for the QM version in December, limiting availability to DM versions only.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://insideevs.com/news/627793/rivian-r1t-r1s-no-quad-motor-max-pack-2023/ |title=Rivian Removes Variant Of Its R1T For 2023, Provides Other Updates |author=Loveday, Steven |date=December 21, 2022 |work=Inside EVs |access-date=May 26, 2023}}</ref> The "Enduro" traction motors for the DM versions were developed by Rivian in-house and reduce the number of semiconductors used compared to the QM, alleviating a key component supply restraint;<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.carscoops.com/2023/04/rivian-is-making-its-own-new-motors-to-speed-up-production-and-reduce-delays/ |title=Rivian Is Making Its Own New Motors To Speed Up Production And Reduce Delays |author=Bell, Sebastien |date=April 14, 2023 |work=CarScoops |access-date=May 30, 2023}}</ref> production began in February 2023,<ref name=IEVs-20230224>{{cite news |url=https://insideevs.com/news/654215/rivian-starts-production-enduro-motors-for-dual-motor-awd-models/ |title=Rivian Starts Production Of Enduro Motors For Dual-Motor AWD Models |author=Mihalascu, Dan |date=February 24, 2023 |work=Inside EVs |access-date=May 26, 2023}}</ref> although most of the initial production were diverted to [[Rivian EDV]]s.

In April 2023, Rivian introduced a "Performance Dual-Motor" option (PDM), which uses software to unlock enhanced performance from the DM motors. With the PDM option, the R1T will produce approximately {{cvt|700|hp}} and {{cvt|700|lbft}} of torque.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/7/23673961/rivian-performance-dual-motor-availability-max-pack-battery |title=Rivian's new 'Performance' powertrain lets R1T reservation holders keep their big battery |author=Shakir, Umar |date=April 7, 2023 |work=The Verge |access-date=May 26, 2023}}</ref> As tested by ''Motor Trend'', each PDM [[traction motor]] has a maximum output of {{cvt|350|hp}} and {{cvt|428|lbft}}; combined output is slightly less than double, at {{cvt|665|hp}} and {{cvt|829|lbft}}. Externally, the PDM (silver accented badging, black brake calipers) can be distinguished from the QM (yellow accented badging and yellow brake calipers).<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.motortrend.com/reviews/2023-rivian-r1t-dual-motor-performance-first-test-review/ |title=2023 Rivian R1T Dual-Motor Performance First Test: It's the Same Picture |author=Evans, Scott |author2=Walker, William (photographer) |date=July 13, 2023 |work=Motor Trend |access-date=July 14, 2023}}</ref>

R1T has safety and driver assistance package called the Driver+.

=== Wiring ===
Second generation R1S/T vehicles adopted a zonal wiring architecture or the earlier ECU/device approach. The new approach reduces the total wiring length by 1.6 miles and weight by {{Convert|20|kg|abbr=on}}, reducing material costs by 20% and carbon footprint  by 15%.

The earlier R1s used a domain-based architecture, pairing each category of software with a piece of hardware. The result required 17 ECUs. The second generation provides four systems with separate ECUs: infotainment, autonomy, vehicle access, drive units, and battery management. The remaining functions require only three ECUs.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Shaw |first=Kristin |date=August 6, 2024 |title=How Rivian reduced electrical wiring by 1.6 miles and 44 pounds |url=https://www.popsci.com/technology/rivian-zonal-electrical-architecture/ |access-date=August 8, 2024 |website=Popular Science |language=en-US}}</ref>{{clarify|reason=4 systems with 5 ECUs - plus another 3 ECUs.
