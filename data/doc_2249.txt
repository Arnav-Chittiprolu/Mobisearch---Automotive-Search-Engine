[ 1 ] [ 2 ] Operating income and operating profit are sometimes used as a synonym for EBIT when a firm does not have non-operating income and non-operating expenses. [ 3 ] Formula [ edit ] EBIT = (net income) + interest + taxes = EBITDA – (depreciation and amortization expenses) operating income = ( gross income ) – OPEX = EBIT – (non-operating profit) + (non-operating expenses) [ 3 ] where EBITDA = earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization OPEX = operating expense Overview [ edit ] A professional investor contemplating a change to the capital structure of a firm (e.g., through a leveraged buyout ) first evaluates a firm's fundamental earnings potential (reflected by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ( EBITDA ) and EBIT), and then determines the optimal use of debt versus equity (equity value). To calculate EBIT, expenses (e.g. the cost of goods sold , selling and administrative expenses) are subtracted from revenues. [ 4 ] Net income is later obtained by subtracting interest and taxes from the result. Example statement of income (figures in thousands) [ 1 ] Revenue Sales revenue $20,438 Cost of goods sold $7,943 Gross profit $12,495 Operating expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses $8,172 Depreciation and amortization $960 Other expenses $138 Total operating expenses $9,270 Operating profit $3,225 Non-operating income $130 Earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) $3,355 Financial income $45 Income before interest expense (IBIE) $3,400 Financial expense $190 Earnings before income taxes (EBT) $3,210 Income taxes $1,027 Net income $2,183 Earnings before taxes [ edit ] Earnings before taxes ( EBT ) is the money retained by the firm before deducting the money to be paid for taxes . EBT excludes the money paid for interest . Thus, it can be calculated by subtracting the interest from EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes).
