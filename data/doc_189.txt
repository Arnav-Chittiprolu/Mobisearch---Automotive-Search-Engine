Help From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This is a maintenance category , used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project . It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages , or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories (except for eponymous maintenance categories). This is a hidden category . It is not shown on its member pages, unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. This category has a backlog that requires the attention of willing editors. This notice will hide itself when this category has fewer than 1000 items. ( recount ) Random page in this category This category keeps track of articles with the {{ dead link }} template that have the fix-attempted parameter set to "yes".  These are cases in which someone has tried to fix the dead link by replacing it with an archive link, but no archive could be found. In these cases, it may be best to remove or replace the link.  Please review WP:DEADLINK for current policy before editing the tagged dead links.
