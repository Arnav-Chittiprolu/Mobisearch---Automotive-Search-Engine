Body styles have included a three and five-door hatchback and four-door sedan , equipped with inline-four gasoline and diesel engines, and front-wheel drive . The Rio replaced the first generation Pride —a rebadged version of the Ford Festiva —and the Avella , a subcompact sold as a Ford in some markets. A second generation was introduced in 2005 in Europe and in 2006 in North America , sharing its platform with the Hyundai Accent , a subcompact manufactured by its sister Hyundai Motor Company in South Korea . In August 2023, the K3 was introduced as its successor in several markets such as Mexico and the GCC countries.

When released, it was the least-expensive mass-produced car to be sold in the United States. [ 4 ] While the Rio's styling and affordability were well-received, it was derided for its poor build quality and driving experience. [ 5 ] The station wagon was marketed as the "Rio Cinco" in the United States, "Rio RX- V " in Canada , and "Rio Look" in Chile . The sedan/saloon version was not sold in the United Kingdom , and the station wagon/hatchback was known as the "Rio" there. In Greece, both versions were sold as the "Rio". In South Korea, this was the only generation to use the "Rio" name, as the "Pride" name was used from the second generation onwards. The first generation Rio offered only one engine for each model year in the United States: a 96 hp (72 kW) 1.5-litre DOHC I4 gasoline engine from 2001 through 2002. Then a larger version appeared, a 1.6-litre DOHC four-cylinder rated at 104 hp (78 kW) used for model years 2003 through 2005. All years offered a choice of a five-speed manual transmission or a four-speed F4A-EL automatic . An alternative of a 1.3-litre (1,343 cc) SOHC four-cylinder/eight-valve petrol, producing 75 hp (56 kW) was offered in some other countries, including the United Kingdom and most of continental Europe. The USA-version five-door featured power steering and a tachometer , optional on the sedan. The European version was marketed under several trim levels; standard equipment for all trims included a driver airbag. Additional features were available for promotion in Greece, including leather seats and car alarm. In Europe, the various national markets received different selections of the three engines. The domestic Korean market versions did not include the 1.6-liter version, as the South Korean taxation system heavily penalizes cars of more than 1,500 cc. Claimed outputs for the domestic versions (JIS) were higher, at 84 PS (62 kW) for the little 1.3 and 108 PS (79 kW) for the DOHC 1.5. [ 6 ] For the SOHC 1.5 95 PS (70 kW) was claimed. The first generation hatchback was marketed as the Rio RX-V in South Korea. Safety features included seat belts and an airbag for the driver. ABS was available as an option for entry-line cars but fitted by default for top of the range models (i.e., Rio LX, in the UK, and Rio LS, in Greece). There was a version called the Sports-Pac, which featured a bonnet scoop, a rear wing, golden wheels, and blue paint, all inspired by the Subaru Impreza WRX STi. Mechanically the Sports-Pac was identical to regular models, with the exception of lowered suspension. [ 7 ] Facelift [ edit ] In 2002, the Rio received a mild redesign (for the 2003 model year in the US) including upgrades in engine, suspension, brakes, and new exterior and interior styling. After this 2002 facelift, the entire range received the "Rio SF" moniker in the domestic South Korean market, with "SF" standing for both "Science Fiction" and "Safety First". In Europe, the facelifted Rio received minor changes in external look and engine improvement of the 1.3 from 75 hp (56 kW) to 80 hp (60 kW) at 5,500 rpm, and 86 lb⋅ft (117 N⋅m) at 3,000 rpm. Iranian production of the facelifted Rio by SAIPA began in 2005. The cars were not equipped with ABS or airbags until 2012, powered by a version of the 1.5 litre engine which produces 96 hp (72 kW) at 5,500 rpm and 135 N⋅m (100 ft⋅lbf) torque at 4,500 rpm. In early 2012, the production ended.

The engine was upgraded to a 110 hp 1.6-litre DOHC four-cylinder "Alpha II" engine now also shared with the Hyundai Accent. Other changes include a new exterior design, an increase in exterior size and interior volume, increased safety features and fuel economy . The station wagon was dropped with this generation in favor of a new 5-door hatchback. Hatchback (pre-facelift) Sedan (pre-facelift) Sedan (China) Kia offered the 2006 sedan as the Rio and Rio LX, the LX trim included power steering, air conditioning, and CD player . The Rio5 (USA) is offered simply in SX trim level with leather-covered steering wheel . As in the first generation, only the five-door hatchback version was offered in some European markets (including the UK). Three engines are available; a 1.6-litre DOHC engine with 110 hp (82 kW), a lesser 1.4-litre version with 96 hp (72 kW) and a 1.5-litre turbo-diesel engine with 109 hp. However, in the US market only the 1.6-litre gasoline engine is offered, in two body styles: a four-door-sedan and a five-door hatch. The European version's common rail diesel engine produces 110 PS (81 kW). In 2007, an SX trim level was added to the Rio sedan with the same features supplied with the Rio5 SX. In 2007, the South Korean government began testing approximately 4,000 pre-production Rio hybrid-electric models, with parent company Hyundai Kia Automotive Group later announcing and subsequently withdrawing anticipated release dates for the hybrid model. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] For 2008, Kia offered the LX trim level for the Rio5 (similar to the Rio LX sedan) and a limited production of Rio5 SX Tuner models, featuring Falken FK452 tires, Tanabe strut tower brace and Eibach Federn lowering springs . [ 11 ] For the 2009 model year, all Rio and Rio5 trims received standard Sirius Satellite Radio (complimentary for three months) and radios with USB port & auxiliary jack , the auxiliary jack substituting for a Bluetooth mobile phone connection for devices with an earphone jack. The Kia Rio ranked 5th in the "20 least expensive 2009 vehicles to insure" list by Insure.com. According to research , the Rio is one of the least expensive vehicles to insure. [ 12 ] For the Malaysian market, the second generation Rio was launched on the 7 September 2005 available with only one trim level with only the hatchback body style and powered by a 1.4-litre 16 valve DOHC engine with a 4-speed automatic gearbox and was fully imported from South Korea. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Facelift [ edit ] Hatchback (2010 facelift) Sedan (2010 facelift) For the 2010 model year, the models received a facelift in late 2009, adopting Kia's new Tiger nose grille. In addition, the steering wheel receives the same design as the Kia Soul and Kia Forte , featuring optional Bluetooth hands-free phone operation, and the gauges cluster receives a new red backlit design. The headlights were modified slightly, with a darker appearance and parking lights and side-marker lights sharing the turn-signal housing. Side moldings on the car became narrower and body-colored. For the UK version, the Rio looks exactly the same as the US version, except that only the hatchback variant is sold there. It has Kia's new 'Tiger Nose' grille (for the 2010 model) and is powered by a 1.4-litre DOHC four-cylinder 16-valve petrol engine, or a 1.5-liter DOHC four-cylinder 16-valve diesel. They both have a five speed manual gearbox. This facelifted Kia Rio was never being sold in the markets of Central and Southeastern Europe, [ 16 ] [ 17 ] apparently due to dismal sales, as well as due to the insufficient production capacities.

It was designed at Kia's design studios in Irvine, California . The vehicle feature sloping shoulder lines and wedge-shaped exteriors, which is inline with other Kia models at the time such as the 2011 Optima and Sportage. The Rio also feature its own interpretation of Kia's signature grille known as the "Tiger Nose", which is slimmed down to connect to the headlamp design. The new design includes a larger air intake. Its extended wheelbase of 2,570 mm (101.2 in) improves passenger and cargo space. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] The Rio in Europe also receives a 3-door model. It is mechanically identical to the 5-door, though its longer doors give it a more sporting appearance that appeals to younger audiences. The 3-door is also noticeably cheaper than the 5-door. In November 2011, the third-generation Rio was awarded Semperit Irish Car of the Year and in December was awarded Australian CarsGuide 's 2011 Car of the Year award as well, triumphing over many other vehicles including the likes of the Range Rover Evoque and the recently facelifted Ford Territory . Rear view (3-door hatchback) Rear view (5-door hatchback) Sedan Rear view Interior Powertrain [ edit ] The UB Rio featured 1.4-litre or 1.6-litre Hyundai GDI Gamma engines . The European market also received the option of a 1.25-litre petrol engine, as well as a 1.4-litre or 1.1-litre CRDi turbo-diesel engine - the 1.1-litre engine having the lowest CO 2 emissions and highest MPG of any non-electric or hybrid car currently on sale at time of writing; up to 88 mpg on the EU combined cycle (73 mpg in US gallons) and emitting only 85 grams of CO 2 per kilometer. This market, however, lacked the 1.6-litre engine, with the 1.4-litre being the most powerful on offer. Transmission options included a 6-speed manual and 6-speed automatic for the American market, with the European market receiving a 5-speed manual for the 1.25-litre Petrol engine, a 6-speed manual for the 1.4-litre petrol, 1.1-litre and 1.4-litre diesels and a 4-speed automatic for the 1.4-litre petrol "2" spec model in 5-door configuration. Intelligent stop & go was an option on almost all available trim and engine levels.

In price order from lowest to highest, the Rio trim levels are: 1, 1 Air, VR7 / SR7, 2, 3, and 4. From launch in 2011, the trim levels available were 2 and 3, with the more basic 1, starting from £10,695, and 1 Air trims coming one year later in 2012 and the top spec Rio 4 being added to the line up in 2014. The base Rio 1 had the lack of features such as air-conditioning and alloy wheels but all Rio models were equipped with Bluetooth from factory. The Rio VR7 was a special edition model that entered the range in 2014 which was based on a 1 Air model but came with upgraded features such as 15" alloy wheels, rear parking sensors, and a leather steering wheel. This became the Rio SR7 after the facelift in 2015. The Rio 2 gained 16" alloy wheels, front fog lights, and heated power-folding door mirrors over the VR7 / SR7 but had a lack of parking sensors amongst the standard equipment. The Rio 3 and 4 were the higher trim levels within the range, with the Rio 3 receiving features such as 17" diamond-cut alloy wheels, heated front seats, LED daytime running lights & rear lights, automatic & cornering headlights, automatic climate control, and a 'Premium Supervision cluster', a larger information display within the driver gauges. Finally, the top spec Rio 4 gained features such as a sunroof, black leather upholstery, a heated steering wheel, and keyless entry & start over the 3 model. After the facelift in 2015, the Rio 3 and 4 gained a multi-function touchscreen with satellite navigation and a reversing camera, exclusive to these higher models. There were four engines available in the Rio. These are all from Kia's ECOdynamics engine range, consisting of a 1.2 litre and 1.4 litre four-cylinder petrol, a 1.1 litre three-cylinder diesel, and a 1.4 litre four-cylinder diesel. Rio 1, 1 Air and VR7/SR7 were only available with the 1.2 petrol and 1.1 diesel, and the Rio 2 was available with all four engine options. The 3 and 4 trim levels were only available with the 1.4 petrol and 1.4 diesel, both standard with a 6-speed manual, with an option of a 4-speed automatic on the 1.4 petrol, which was also available in the Rio 2. The colours available on the pre-facelift Rio are Clear White (standard colour), Bright Silver, Midnight Black, Blaze Red, Electric Blue (2, 3 & 4), and Graphite Metallic, the latter only being available on 3 and 4 models. The facelift brought two new colours to the Rio; Urban Blue, replacing Electric Blue and is only available on Rio 2 and 3, and Yellow Zest, a colour exclusive to the SR7 trim. Graphite Metallic still remains available on the facelift Rio but only on the Rio 4.

The new car was designed in Kia's California and Germany design centers and features longer front overhangs, larger hood and a more upright C-pillars for the hatchback model. [ 40 ] The hatchback model is 15 mm longer, 5 mm wider and 5 mm shorter in height than its predecessor. Unlike the previous generations, the fourth-generation Rio is an export-only model since it is not offered in the South Korean domestic market due to decreasing sales of its predecessor. [ 41 ] In the country, the Rio-based Stonic crossover was offered instead. In European markets, the car is only offered in a 5-door hatchback form, while the 3-door hatchback option was discontinued. [ 42 ] In other markets such as the Americas, both the 5-door hatchback and sedan body styles are offered. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] For the North American market, the Rio is manufactured alongside the Forte at the newly built Pesquería plant in Mexico. [ 37 ] For the North American market, the 1.6-liter Gamma GDi engine was replaced by the 1.6-litre Gamma II MPi starting from the 2020 model year. The EPA fuel economy rating was significantly improved as a result, while rated maximum horsepower reduced from 130 hp (132 PS; 97 kW) to a peak 120 hp (122 PS; 89 kW).
