British [[train operating company]] [[Virgin Trains West Coast]] claimed to have run the UK's first "biodiesel train", when a [[British Rail Class 220|Class 220]] was converted to run on 80% petrodiesel and 20% biodiesel.<ref>{{cite news|title=First UK biodiesel train launched|url=https://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6729115.stm|publisher=BBC|access-date=2007-11-17|date=2007-06-07|archive-date=2008-02-13|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213193255/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6729115.stm|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>Virgin launches trials with Britain's first biofuel train ''[[Rail (magazine)|Rail]]'' issue 568 20 June 2007 page 6</ref>

The [[British Royal Train]] on 15 September 2007 completed its first ever journey run on 100% biodiesel fuel supplied by Green Fuels Ltd. [[Prince Charles]] and Green Fuels managing director James Hygate were the first passengers on a train fueled entirely by biodiesel fuel. Since 2007, the Royal Train has operated successfully on B100 (100% biodiesel).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ews-railway.co.uk/cmsnews/news_article.asp?guid=%7BD3A02A0C-1B28-4E08-8548-B3863CFF286C%7D|title=EWS Railway – News Room|publisher=www.ews-railway.co.uk|access-date=2009-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200219100207/https://uk.dbcargo.com/rail-uk-en?guid=%7BD3A02A0C-1B28-4E08-8548-B3863CFF286C%7D|archive-date=2020-02-19|url-status=dead}}</ref> A government white paper also proposed converting large portions of the UK railways to biodiesel but the proposal was subsequently dropped in favour of further electrification.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Great Britain.

Similarly, a state-owned [[short-line railroad]] in [[Eastern Washington]] ran a test of a 25% biodiesel / 75% petrodiesel blend during the summer of 2008, purchasing fuel from a biodiesel producer sited along the railroad tracks.<ref>{{cite news|title=Biodiesel will drive Eastern Wa. train during summerlong test|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008011135_biodiesel22.html|newspaper=Seattle Times|access-date=2009-03-01|first=Shawn|last=Vestal|date=2008-06-22|archive-date=2009-02-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202184016/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008011135_biodiesel22.html|url-status=live}}</ref> The train will be powered by biodiesel made in part from [[canola]] grown in agricultural regions through which the short line runs.

Also in 2007, Disneyland began running the park trains on B98 (98% biodiesel). The program was discontinued in 2008 due to storage issues, but in January 2009, it was announced that the park would then be running all trains on biodiesel manufactured from its own used cooking oils. This is a change from running the trains on soy-based biodiesel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/01/29/Disneyland_trains_running_on_biodiesel/UPI-10151233252145/|title=Disneyland trains running on biodiesel - UPI.com|publisher=www.upi.com|access-date=2009-03-16|archive-date=2009-01-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130035705/http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/01/29/Disneyland_trains_running_on_biodiesel/UPI-10151233252145/|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2007, the historic [[Mount Washington Cog Railway|Mt. Washington Cog Railway]] added the first biodiesel locomotive to its all-steam locomotive fleet. The fleet has climbed up the western slopes of [[Mount Washington (New Hampshire)|Mount Washington]] in [[New Hampshire]] since 1868 with a peak vertical climb of 37.4 degrees.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kotrba|first=Ron|title='Name that Biodiesel Train' contest|url=http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/blog/article/2013/05/name-that-biodiesel-train-contest|access-date=8 May 2014|newspaper=Biodiesel Magazine|date=29 May 2013|archive-date=8 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508063652/http://www.biodieselmagazine.com/blog/article/2013/05/name-that-biodiesel-train-contest|url-status=live}}</ref>

In 2009, the [[Grand Canyon Railway]] started running engine [[Grand Canyon Railway 4960|4960]] on used cooking oil.
