=== Double Cardan Joint ===
[[Image:Double Cardan Joint (animated).gif|thumb|right|Double Cardan joint]]
Double Cardan Joints are similar to Hooke's use of two universal joints except that the length of the intermediate shaft is shortened leaving only the yokes; this effectively allows the two Hooke's joints to be mounted back to back. DCJs are typically used in steering columns, as they eliminate the need to correctly phase the universal joints at the ends of the intermediate shaft (IS), which eases packaging of the IS around the other components in the engine bay of the car. They are also used to replace Rzeppa style constant-velocity joints in applications where high articulation angles, or impulsive torque loads are common, such as the driveshafts and halfshafts of rugged four-wheel drive vehicles. 

To be truly constant-velocity, Double Cardan joints require a centering element that will maintain equal angles between the driven and driving shafts.<ref name="US patent 1979768">{{cite patent

In order to provide the constant velocity feature for the <nowiki>[</nowiki>double cardan<nowiki>]</nowiki> joint, it is essential that the centre of angulation of each spider and bearing assembly, and each yoke, be maintained about the same point during the life of the joint.</ref>

=== Tracta joints ===
[[File:Tracta_Constant_Velocity_Joint.jpg|thumb|right|Tracta Joint]]
The [[Tracta]] joint works on the principle of the double [[tongue and groove]] joint. It comprises only four individual parts: the two forks (a.k.a. yokes, one driving and one driven) and the two semi-spherical sliding pieces (one called male or spigot swivel and another called female or slotted swivel) which interlock in a floating (movable) connection. Each yoke jaw engages a circular groove formed on the intermediate members. Both intermediate members are coupled together in turn by a swivel tongue and grooved joint. When the input and output shafts are inclined at some working angle to each other, the driving intermediate member accelerates and decelerates during each revolution. Since the central tongue and groove joint are a quarter of a revolution out of phase with the yoke jaws, the corresponding speed fluctuation of the driven intermediate and output jaw members exactly counteracts and neutralizes the speed variation of the input half member. Thus the output speed change is identical to that of the input drive, providing constant velocity rotation.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GPdmft_cpKQC&dq=tracta+joint&pg=PA12 Universal joints and driveshafts: analysis, design, applications]</ref>

=== Rzeppa joints ===
[[File:Cv joint large.png|right|thumb|Rzeppa joint]]
[[File:Gelenk-welle.jpg|thumb|left|Rzeppa joint (compared to a [[1 euro coin]])]]

A Rzeppa joint (invented by [[Alfred H. Rzeppa]] in 1926) consists of a spherical inner shell with 6 grooves in it and a similar enveloping outer shell. Each groove guides one [[Ball bearing|ball]]. The input shaft fits in the centre of a large, steel, star-shaped "gear" that nests inside a circular cage. The cage is spherical but with ends open, and it typically has six openings around the perimeter. This cage and gear fit into a grooved cup that has a splined and threaded shaft attached to it. Six large steel balls sit inside the cup grooves and fit into the cage openings, nestled in the grooves of the star gear. The output shaft on the cup then runs through the wheel bearing and is secured by the axle nut.

This joint can accommodate the large changes of angle when the front wheels are turned by the steering system; typical Rzeppa joints allow 45°–48° of articulation, while some can give 54°.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hoshino |first1=Manabu |last2=Funahashi |first2=Masashi |title=NTN Technical Review No.75 (2007): Fixed Constant Velocity Joint with a Super High Operating Angle of 54 Degrees (TUJ) |url=http://www.ntn.co.jp/english/products/review/pdf/NTN_TR75_en_P016.pdf |website=www.ntnglobal.com |access-date=11 April 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190730143903/https://www.ntnglobal.com/en/products/review/pdf/NTN_TR75_en_P016.pdf |archive-date=2019-07-30}} (Also found in {{cite web |title=Automotive Environmental Technologies |url=https://www.ntnglobal.com/en/products/review/pdf/NTN_TR75_en.pdf |publisher=NTN |access-date=11 April 2021 |date=2007}})</ref> At the "outboard" end of the driveshaft a slightly different unit is used. The end of the driveshaft is [[Rotating spline|splined]] and fits into the outer "joint". It is typically held in place by a [[circlip]].

=== Birfield joints ===
The Birfield joint is a type of constant-velocity joint based on the Rzeppa joint but confined the travel of the six balls using elliptical tracks. They have improved efficiency and are widely used in modern cars for the outboard driveshaft joints.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.beyonddiscovery.org/vehicle-technology/625-birfield-joint-based-on-the-rzeppa-principle.html |title = 625 Birfield joint based on the Rzeppa Principle - Vehicle Technology}}</ref>  The Birfield joint was developed by [[Birfield Industries]] and came into widespread use with the development of front-wheel drive cars such as the [[Mini]].<ref name="Nunney2007">{{cite book|author=Malcolm James Nunney|title=Light and Heavy Vehicle Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xLxySLNAe3YC|year=2007|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7506-8037-0}}</ref>

=== Tripod joints ===
[[File:Tripod half axle.png|thumb|Tripod joint]]
Tripod joints are used at the inboard end of car driveshafts. The joints were developed by Michel Orain, of Glaenzer Spicer of [[Poissy]], [[France]]. This joint has a three-pointed yoke attached to the shaft, which has barrel-shaped roller bearings on the ends. These fit into a cup with three matching grooves, attached to the [[Differential (mechanics)|differential]]. Since there is only significant movement in one axis, this simple arrangement works well. These also allow an axial 'plunge' movement of the shaft, so that engine rocking and other effects do not preload the bearings. A typical Tripod joint has up to 50&nbsp;mm of plunge travel, and 26 degrees of angular articulation.<ref>[http://www.gkndriveline.com/drivelinecms/export/sites/driveline/downloads/brochures/driveshafts_english.pdf GKN Driveline Driveshafts] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723010219/http://www.gkndriveline.com/drivelinecms/export/sites/driveline/downloads/brochures/driveshafts_english.pdf |date=2012-07-23 }}, [http://www.gkndriveline.com gkndriveline.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190703124825/http://www.gkndriveline.com/ |date=2019-07-03 }}.</ref> The tripod joint does not have as much angular range as many of the other joint types, but tends to be lower in cost and more efficient. Due to this it is typically used in rear-wheel drive vehicle configurations or on the inboard side of front-wheel drive vehicles where the required range of motion is lower.

=== Weiss joints ===
The Weiss joint ({{US patent reference | number = 1677311 | y = 1927 | m =  | d =  | inventor = Carl W Weiss | title = Universal joint}}) consists of two identical ball yokes which are positively located (usually) by four balls. The two joints are centered by means of a ball with a hole in the middle. Two balls in circular tracks transmit the torque while the other two preload the joint and ensure there is no backlash when the direction of loading changes.

Its construction differs from that of the Rzeppa in that the balls are a tight fit between two halves of the coupling and that no cage is used. The center ball rotates on a pin inserted in the outer race and serves as a locking medium for the four other balls. When both shafts are in line, that is, at an angle of 180 degrees, the balls lie in a plane that is 90 degrees to the shafts. If the driving shaft remains in the original position, any movement of the driven shaft will cause the balls to move one half of the angular distance. For example, when the driven shaft moves through an angle of 20 degrees, the angle between the two shafts is reduced to 160 degrees. The balls will move 10 degrees in the same direction, and the angle between the driving shaft and the plane in which the balls lie will be reduced to 80 degrees. This action fulfills the requirement that the balls lie in the plane that bisects the angle of drive. This type of Weiss joint is known as the Bendix-Weiss joint.

The most advanced plunging joint which works on the Weiss principle is the six-ball star joint of Kurt Enke. This type uses only three balls to transmit the torque, while the remaining three center and hold it together. The balls are preloaded and the joint is completely encapsulated.<ref>[http://www.tpub.com/basae/119.htm Bendix-Weiss Constant Velocity (CV) Joint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323031934/http://www.tpub.com/basae/119.htm |date=2010-03-23 }}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=GPdmft_cpKQC&dq=weiss+joint&pg=PA19 Universal joints and driveshafts: analysis, design, applications]</ref>

=== Thompson joints ===
[[File:TCVJ.jpg|thumb|A diagram of a Thompson coupling]]
The Thompson joint (also known as a ''Thompson coupling'') assembles two cardan joints within each other to eliminate the intermediate shaft.<ref>{{cite patent |country=US |inventor=Glenn Thompson |title=CONSTANT VELOCITY COUPLING AND
CONTROL SYSTEM THEREFOR |number=US20040106458A1 |pridate=2001-03-26 |pubdate=2004-06-03 |gdate=2006-12-05 |status=patent}}</ref>  A control yoke is added to keep the input and output shafts aligned. The control yoke uses a spherical [[pantograph]] [[scissor mechanism]] to bisect the angle between the input and output shafts and to maintain the joints at a relative phase angle of zero. The alignment ensures constant angular velocity at all joint angles. Eliminating the intermediate shaft and keeping the input shafts aligned in the homokinetic plane greatly reduces the induced [[shear stress]]es and [[vibration]] inherent in [[Universal joint#Double Cardan shaft|double cardan shafts]].<ref name="Sopanen">{{cite web | url = http://www.ee.lut.fi/static/fi/lab/sahkokaytot/sameko/Cardan_Sameko.pdf | title = Studies on Torsion Vibration of a Double Cardan Joint Driveline | last = Sopanen | first = Jussi | year = 1996 | access-date = 2008-01-22 | url-status = dead | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090205135715/http://www.ee.lut.fi/static/fi/lab/sahkokaytot/sameko/Cardan_Sameko.pdf | archive-date = 2009-02-05 }}</ref><ref name = "Sheu">{{cite web | url = http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&cpsidt=3004428| title = Modelling and analysis of the Intermediate Shaft Between Two Universal Joints| last = Sheu| first = P| date = 2003-02-01| access-date = 2008-01-22 }}</ref><ref name="tcvj in action video">{{cite web|title=The Thompson Coupling Joint mechanism in action|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tmvBwVPcSs|publisher=Thompson Couplings|access-date=24 September 2011}}</ref> While the geometric configuration does not maintain constant velocity for the control yoke that aligns the cardan joints, the control yoke has minimal inertia and generates little vibration.

The novel feature of the coupling is the method for geometrically constraining the pair of cardan joints within the assembly by using, for example, a spherical four bar scissors linkage (spherical pantograph) and it is the first coupling to have this combination of properties.<ref name = "Bowman">{{cite web | url = http://www.centralwesterndaily.com.au/news/local/news/general/an-invention-to-drive-fuel-costs-down/191341.aspx | title = An invention to drive fuel costs down| publisher = yourguide.com.au | last = Bowman | first = Rebecca| date = 2006-08-03 | access-date = 2007-02-13 }}</ref> Edit summary (Briefly describe your changes) By publishing changes, you agree to the Terms of Use , and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and the GFDL .
