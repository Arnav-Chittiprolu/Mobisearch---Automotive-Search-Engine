The North American version had a Suzuki-designed 2.5- or 2.7-liter V6 engine , on a rear-wheel drive -based platform with optional four-wheel drive . Beginning in 2003, European versions were also available with a 2.0-liter Peugeot turbodiesel engine producing 109 PS (80 kW). [ 1 ] A unique trait in the US market in this segment was that the XL-7 was available with a five-speed manual transmission, in both five- and seven-seat variants. When introduced, the XL-7 was the least expensive SUV available with three-row seating in North America. It was awarded the Consumers Digest "Best Buy" award. However, sales slowed as the vehicle aged relative to the competition. In Thailand, the Grand Vitara XL-7 was Imported by Siam International Corporation Co. Ltd. on 2002. In Indonesia, the Grand Escudo XL-7 was launched on July 19, 2003, at the 12th Gaikindo Auto Expo . 1999–2000 Suzuki Grand Vitara XL-7 (JA; pre-facelift, Australia) 2004 Suzuki Grand Vitara XL-7 (facelift, UK) Suzuki Grand Escudo L-Edition (facelift, Japan) Second generation (XL7; 2006) [ edit ] Motor vehicle Second generation (Suzuki XL7) Overview Production 2006–2009 Model years 2007–2009 Assembly Canada: Ingersoll, Ontario ( CAMI ) Body and chassis Class Mid-size crossover SUV Layout Front-engine, front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive Platform GM Theta platform/GMT193 Related Chevrolet Equinox Pontiac Torrent Saturn Vue Powertrain Engine 3.6 L N36A V6 Transmission 5-speed manual 5-speed automatic (2007-08) 6-speed automatic (2009) Dimensions Wheelbase 112.4 in (2,855 mm) Length 197.2 in (5,009 mm) Width 72.2 in (1,834 mm) Height 68.9 in (1,750 mm) Rear view Suzuki XL7 of Nobuhiro Tajima at the 2007 Pikes Peak International Hill Climb during the record breaking run Introduced on November 22, 2006, Suzuki partnered with General Motors to build the 2007 model year version, now called XL7 (without the hyphen). It used the same unibody platform and many of the same components as the Chevrolet Equinox , Pontiac Torrent , Saturn Vue and Opel Antara but incorporated third-row seating exclusive to the Suzuki. The second generation model used a version of the GM High Feature engine – designated N36A by Suzuki – built in Japan and shipped to CAMI Automotive in Ingersoll, Ontario , Canada, where the XL7 was assembled alongside the Equinox and Torrent. Styling cues on the 2007 model include a chrome slotted grille and trapezoidal headlights. It no longer has the spare tire mounted on the rear door. From its introduction in 2007 until its discontinuation in 2009, the second-generation Suzuki XL7 was available in five trim levels: Base (2007-08 only), Special (2007 only), Premium (2008-2009 only), Luxury (2007-2009), and Limited (2007-2009). Depending upon the trim level selected, both two-row, five-passenger seating and XL7 specific three-row, seven-passenger seating were available (the related Chevrolet Equinox and Pontiac Torrent did not offer third-row seating as an option). All XL7s came decently equipped, and depending upon the trim level selected, could be equipped with options such as a premium audio system with a subwoofer and an amplifier, faux wood interior trim, luxury leather-trimmed seating surfaces with power-adjustable and heated dual front bucket seats, remote start, a security system, chrome-clad aluminum-alloy wheels, a power sunroof, a Bluetooth hands-free phone system (2009 models only), a single-disc, CD/MP3 player audio system, a six-disc, in-dash CD/MP3 changer audio system, a touchscreen GPS navigation system with SiriusXM Nav Traffic, SiriusXM Satellite Radio , and a rear backup camera system, among other options. Unlike the related Chevrolet Equinox and Pontiac Torrent , the General Motors (GM) OnStar in-vehicle telematics system was not available on the XL7. All second-generation XL7s were powered by the General Motors (GM) High-Feature V6 producing 252 hp (188 kW) and 243 lb⋅ft (329 N⋅m) of torque. This was coded N36A by Suzuki. While 2007 and 2008 models used a five-speed automatic transmission , 2009 models received a new six-speed automatic transmission. Both Front Wheel Drive (FWD) and All Wheel Drive (AWD) models of the XL7 were available. In May 2009, Suzuki halted production of the XL7 indefinitely due to low demand. [ 2 ] Through May 10, 2009, CAMI Automotive had only produced four XL7s for Suzuki after producing more than 12,000 units the previous year. While no direct replacement to the three-row XL7 was available ( General Motors offered the larger Buick Enclave , Chevrolet Traverse , and GMC Acadia midsize three-row crossover SUV's), the Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain were considered the successors to the two-row XL7. The 2009 XL7 would be the final vehicle built by General Motors (GM) in partnership with Suzuki Motors .
