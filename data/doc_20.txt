Ford For more than 40 years now, Car and Driver has been gathering up all the new and substantially updated vehicles of the year for our annual 10Best list. Invitations are also sent to the winners from the previous year (if they're still on sale), so they can defend their titles. While this year's competition started with over 100 entrants, we whittled the field down to our 10 favorite cars and our 10 favorite trucks and SUVs. For kicks, we decided to use those 20 vehicles as the basis for a "How We'd Spec It: 10Best Edition." You can read the full 10Best feature here , but in the meantime, here's how we'd spec some of this year's winners. Caleb Miller's $127,035 Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing Cadillac Cadillac The 10Best list is full of great cars, but there's one that captured my heart  years ago when I drove one for the first time—and that car has held onto it ever since. The Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing is a glorious combination of a 668-hp supercharged V-8 and a six-speed manual. Sure, you can swap the DIY gearbox out for a 10-speed automatic, but here at C/D , we're all about saving the manuals. I painted my stick-shift Blackwing in Typhoon Metallic ($625), pairing the lush hue with the flashy bronze wheels ($1500) and bronze brake calipers ($595).

Since I splurged on that, and since I probably wouldn't take this sports sedan on track that often, I decided to skip the new Precision package's revised suspension and carbon-ceramic brakes, saving $18K. Inside, I opted for the natural tan and black leather look. It's a pricey $8090 choice, but the all-black upholstery is too drab, and I've seen how quickly the  Sky Cool Gray seats invite stains. A microsuede-wrapped steering wheel and shift knob added $300, while floor mats and a cargo mat added an extra $350. All told, my CT5-V Blackwing came out to $127,035. That's a lot of coin, but the beastly powertrain and addictive gearbox are worth it. – Caleb Miller Read the Story Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing: Car and Driver 2026 10Best Carter Fry's $123,250 Lucid Gravity Grand Touring Lucid Lucid After getting a chance to cruise around town in a Lucid Gravity not long ago, I believe it is the best family SUV on the market today. If money isn't an object, of course. If you have a family and you’re in the financial position to afford a Gravity, I don’t think it’s a reach to assume you have a house too. Garage or not, that should mean it's easy to charge this EV overnight, greatly reducing the pain of owning an EV. If that's true, you've got yourself a vehicle with gorgeous styling, great practicality, and more standard torque than a Corvette Z06. I had to give this sleek SUV the all-black exterior treatment; good thing Abyss Black is the standard color. All black everything means I’m going with the Stealth Appearance package as well, which is also standard. Although, for my personal taste, it is not nearly dark enough. For wheels, I’m balling out for the largest-diameter Aether Stealths wrapped in Pirellis ($3500). The sidewall is shorter than the standard wheel setup, which ruins the ride a bit, but I'm going for style points here. I chose the Tahoe leather interior ($4200) to warm up the cabin a little bit. An all-black interior would be great, but a little bit of peanut butter never hurt anybody. Well, except me. I’m allergic. The seven-passenger seating option seemed a little steep at $2900. Plus, I’d much rather have the extra cargo capacity, including the cavernous space in the floor where the third row would be stored, so I opted for the two-row version. Instead, I funneled that $2900 towards the upgraded sound system. Speaking of options, I just checked every single one because it’s all great: DreamDrive 2 Pro ($6750), Dynamic Handling package ($2900), Technology package ($3200), Comfort and Convenience package ($2500), and Towing package ($750). The biggest standout on that list is the Handling package, which enables the Gravity to sit as high as nine inches off the ground or as low as five inches via the air suspension. I think the Gravity looks damn good when it sits that low, and the total price comes to $123,250. – Carter Fry Read the Story Lucid Gravity: Car and Driver 2026 10Best Trucks and SUVs Eric Stafford's $61,455 Ford Ranger Raptor Ford Ford Ford's Ranger Raptor low-key might be the best bang-for-your-buck pickup truck on the market. Sure, the 2025 model starts at $57,965, but nowadays that's not a lot more than the average price of a new car —and how many of those can you launch off a sand dune? Exactly. The widebody Ranger also shares a powertrain with the Bronco Raptor , albeit at a roughly $24K discount. And if you have $850 burning a hole in your wallet, you can increase the twin-turbo 3.0-liter V-6's output from 405 to 455 horses with an engine calibration tool from Ford Performance . For those reasons, the Ranger Raptor is the 10Best winner I'd most likely buy. My ideal spec would wear the $395 Velocity Blue paint, because it's the only available color that will stand out when covered in dust and mud. I'd also spend an extra $1495 for the 17-inch beadlock-capable wheels because I'd rather not worry about the 33-inch BFGoodrich KO3 all-terrain tires separating from a rim right while I'm crawling over a bunch of rocks. Along with the keycode pad ($225) for the driver's door and the spray-in bedliner ($495), I'd choose the $750 graphics for the hood, bedsides, and tailgate. The new checkered motif isn't as cool as the tattered look of the older F-150 Raptors, but that's just, like, my opinion, man. Finally, the $130 mud flaps will hopefully help extend the life of my $61,455 truck's pretty paint. – Eric Stafford Read the Story Ford Ranger Raptor: Car and Driver 2026 10Best Trucks and SUVs Jack Fitzgerald's $92,845 Mercedes-Benz E450 Wagon Mercedes-Benz Mercedes-Benz Most days of the week, I'd pick the Cadillac CT5-V Blackwing over nearly any other car on sale. I'm also young enough and dumb enough to think that daily driving sports cars such as the BMW M2 and Chevy Corvette is a good idea. But I'm also pampered enough to be allowed to spend time in the occasional luxury vehicle, and believe me when I tell you that the new Mercedes-Benz E450 is a true showstopper. The all-terrain Merc might not have the same performance chops as some of the other 10Best winners, but it'll hustle you to 60 mph in a brisk 4.4 seconds with more comfort than the rest. Since Mercedes doesn't offer the E450 in a dark green, I opted for the no-cost Nautical Blue metallic paint. I would've preferred to stick with the 19-inch wheels for comfort, but the $850 20-inch AMG cross-spoke setup looks the best, so that's what my wagon would wear. Things got a bit more expensive once I moved to the interior section of the configurator. There went $2990 for the Tonka Brown Nappa and Black leather upholstery, $1515 for the Natural Grain Brown Maple trim on the dash, and another $200 to make the wood extend to the center console. Another $800 for the MB-Tex upper dash trim and ventilated front seats, and $2950 for the massaging seat package. I live in Michigan, so $450 for a heated steering wheel is a no-brainer. Lastly, $2550 went to the head-up display package and $990 toward the digital LED headlights, because if I'm spending this much on a luxo-barge, it may as well come loaded to the gills. All told, my Merc wagon came out to $92,845. – Jack Fitzgerald Read the Story Mercedes-Benz E450: Car and Driver 2026 10Best Cars ➡️ Skip the lot. Let Car and Driver help you find your next car.
