In 1995 Rochester became part of Delphi , which in turn became a separate company four years later, [ 1 ] and continues to manufacture fuel injection systems in Rochester, now part of General Motors Automotive Components Holdings- Rochester Operations. History [ edit ] The company began as the Rochester Coil Company founded by Edward A. Halbleib in 1908, [ 2 ] becoming the North East Electric Company the following year. In 1916 the company was located at 348 Whitney Street, Rochester. [ 3 ] In 1929 Alfred P. Sloan announced the acquisition of the company on behalf of General Motors. [ 4 ] "For some years this Company has been an outstanding manufacturer of starters, ignition systems and other electrical equipment." [ 5 ] "It was consolidated with GM's former Delco-Light Company in 1930 and later renamed Delco Appliance Division." In 1937 Rochester Products was founded, planned as a second plant for Delco Appliance, but achieving Division status by 1939. [ 6 ] In 1953 an advertisement in Life stated: "Rochester builds original equipment carburetors for Chevrolet starting with 1950, Oldsmobile from 1949 and Cadillac from 1951. Also, Rochester supplies replacement carburetors for Chevrolets from 1932." [ 7 ] Rochester also supplied Pontiac, while using the Power Jet name in the replacement market. [ 8 ] In 1952 the Oregonian reported: "Automobile cigarette lighters produced by the Rochester Automotive products division of General Motors are tested to reach a temperature of 1400 degrees in no less than 10 and no more than 12 seconds." [ 9 ] The 2G (later 2GC and 2GV) carburetor, commonly called the 2 Jet, was introduced in 1955, and continued to be used on GM V8s until at least 1969. [ 10 ] In all, it was used in at least 125 applications, including the Brockway 's inline six . [ 11 ] In 1957 Chevrolet introduced their first fuel-injected engine, [ 12 ] the Rochester Ramjet high-performance option on Corvette and passenger cars at $484. [ 13 ] In 1956 Oldsmobile were also experimenting with Rochester fuel injection, at the GM desert proving grounds near Phoenix, but offered the Rochester triple-carburetor J2 option for 1957. [ 14 ] The company is best known [ according to whom? ] for the Quadrajet carburetor, which was originally designed in the 1960s and remained in production, with modifications to meet progressively tightening exhaust emission limits , into the 1980s. The Quadrajet became computer controlled in 1980 in California and in 1981 in the rest of the states; its last application was on the 1990 Cadillac Brougham and 1990 full size GM station wagons with the Olds 307 engine. [ citation needed ] RPD was a pioneer in fuel injection systems in road cars in the 1980s. [ citation needed ] In addition to carburetors, Rochester also made various emissions control equipment such as charcoal canisters and EGR valves , [ 15 ] which found use in GM vehicles as well as those from other makes. [ citation needed ] Other products made at this plant were locks and keys [ citation needed ] as well as steel tubing for both vehicular and non-vehicular applications. [ citation needed ] The last major carburetor design by Rochester was the Varajet II, [ citation needed ] essentially a Quadrajet halved lengthwise, [ citation needed ] and was one of the few successful progressive 2-barrel carburetors. [ according to whom? ] It was installed on 4- and 6-cylinder engines from 1979 to 1986. [ citation needed ] In 1981, Rochester Products and Diesel Equipment Division merged in what was publicly described as a cost-cutting move.  At this time RPD had about 7,000 employees, and DED had about 3,300 employees. [ 16 ] DED had plants in Grand Rapids, Michigan. [ 17 ] The headquarters remained in Rochester. In 1988, the diesel fuel injection business was sold to Penske Transportation, [ 18 ] and Rochester Products and AC Spark Plug merged. [ 19 ] Between the end of 1991 and the beginning of 1992, Rochester Products, at the request of General Motors do Brasil , launched on the Brazilian market the first electronic fuel injection in the world programmed and developed for ethanol in the Chevrolet Monza , Chevrolet Kadett and Chevrolet Ipanema , known in Europe such as Opel Ascona , Opel Kadett and Opel Kadett Caravan respectively.  The system model was the Rochester Multec-700 with a single fuel injector (singlepoint). [ citation needed ] In 1994, the Grand Rapids operations of AC Rochester were spun off.
