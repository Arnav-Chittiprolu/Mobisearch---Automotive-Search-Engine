The first-generation Mobilio that was produced from 2001 to 2008 and sold exclusively in Japan. It was the second model in Honda's "Small Max" series and also took Honda's Global Small Platform and their i-DSI engine. In May 2008, the Freed was introduced, replacing the first-generation model. The second-generation Mobilio, which is based on the Brio , was introduced in September 2013 and went on sale in January 2014 for several emerging markets . First generation (GB1/2; 2001) [ edit ] Motor vehicle First generation 2001–2004 Mobilio (pre-facelift, Japan) Overview Model code GB1/2 Production December 2001 – May 2008 Assembly Japan: Suzuka, Mie Body and chassis Body style 5-door minivan Layout Front-engine, front-wheel-drive Front-engine, four-wheel-drive Platform Honda Global Small Platform Related Honda Fit (first generation) Powertrain Engine Petrol : 1.5 L L15A2 i-DSI I4 1.5 L L15A1 VTEC I4 Power output 66 kW (89 hp; 90 PS) ( L15A2 i-DSI) 81 kW (109 hp; 110 PS) ( L15A1 VTEC) Transmission CVT Dimensions Wheelbase 2,740 mm (107.9 in) Length 4,055–4,070 mm (159.6–160.2 in) Width 1,685–1,690 mm (66.3–66.5 in) Height 1,705 mm (67.1 in) (FWD) 1,725 mm (67.9 in) (4WD) 1,730 mm (68.1 in) (Mobilio Spike) Curb weight 1,270 kg (2,800 lb) Chronology Predecessor Honda Capa (for Mobilio) Honda S-MX (for Mobilio Spike) Successor Honda Freed The first-generation Mobilio was released on 21 December 2001. [ 2 ] It is a 1.5-litre compact MPV that was designed with recreational activities in mind. The Mobilio, according to Honda, attained the highest fuel rating in the 7-passenger vehicle class, at 17.2 km/L (49 mpg ‑imp ; 40 mpg ‑US ). It was discontinued in May 2008 following the release of the Freed. The Mobilio featured a spacious cargo area that was 1.86 m (6.09 ft) deep and 1.10 m (3.6 ft) tall and could be configured in 5 modes; utility mode, long mode, twin mode, refresh mode and adjustment mode. Along with the flexible cargo configurations, there are two sliding doors, one on each side. Interior tailgate storage hooks can hold about 5.0 kg (11 lb). The Mobilio incorporates Honda's G-CON (G-force Control) technology, for enhanced crash safety. The vehicle body is designed to offer protection to occupants in a 55 km/h full-frontal collision, a 64 km/h front offset collision, 55 km/h side collision and a 50 km/h rear collision. Honda has implemented its own vehicle-to-vehicle collision testing program: 50% frontal offset collision with a 2-ton class vehicle while both vehicles traveling at 50 km/h, to help improve safety in real-world collisions. In order to enhance recyclability, almost all interior injection-molded parts are made of olefin resin. Together with other measures, it results in an overall vehicle recyclability of over 90%. [ 3 ] The 1.5 L VTEC engine is designed for both power and fuel economy. The Japanese Ministry of Transport recognized the Mobilio as an "excellent low emissions" vehicle. Also featured in the Mobilio is the Honda Multimatic S ( CVT ). It is Honda's new generation of CVT with 7-speed mode that offers three driving modes: CVT, 7-speed automatic shift mode and 7-speed manual shift mode. Four-wheel drive is also available. 2001–2004 Mobilio (pre-facelift, Japan) 2004–2008 Mobilio (facelift, Japan) 2004–2008 Mobilio (facelift, Japan) Mobilio Spike [ edit ] The Mobilio Spike was released in Japan on 19 September 2002.

[ 21 ] After the facelift, the Mobilio S received some additional equipment such as the double blower air conditioning system as well as alloy wheels. [ 22 ] The mid-range E trim of the Mobilio has 15-inch (380 mm) alloy wheels, security system, body colour painted door handles and side mirrors that comes with indicators, and double-blower air conditioning.

The Prestige has chrome decorations on its fog light borders, side mouldings, license plate holder, and muffler tip. The alloy wheel design was unique to the model.

Facelift [ edit ] On 12 January 2017, the Mobilio received a facelift, featuring redesigned front fascia and an addition of thin chrome bars on the trunk. ABS and EBD became standard on all trims.

The RS trim receives the same 15-inch (380 mm), two-tone alloy wheels that are optional on the N-Box Custom kei car , [ 28 ] [ 22 ] while the E trim received the wheels previously used on the facelifted RS trim. The S trim received the same front grille and wheels as the Mobilio E Special Edition. The 6.2-inch (160 mm) resistive touchscreen display head unit is now standard in both S and E trims. The RS trim received a shark fin antenna, smoked tail lamps, orange accent trims on the dashboard, red stitching on the seats, redesigned meter cluster with RS logo, and an 8-inch (200 mm) capacitive touchscreen display head unit.

[ 29 ] The trim's front grille and wheels were reverted to the previous design from the 2017 facelift model. The second-generation Mobilio stopped production in Indonesia in June 2024 due to shifting demands to vehicles with higher ground clearance, such as the BR-V.
