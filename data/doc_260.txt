{{Main|Battery recycling}}

The recycling of lithium-ion batteries is a growing but underdeveloped industry. Despite their value, global recycling rates remain low; the International Energy Agency estimated in 2024 that only 5% of used electric vehicle batteries were recycled worldwide.<ref>{{Cite web|title=What is the state of battery recycling? – Analysis - IEA|url=https://www.iea.org/en/analysis/what-is-the-state-of-battery-recycling|website=IEA|access-date=September 19, 2025}}</ref> Li-ion battery elements including iron, copper, nickel, and cobalt can be recycled, but mining new materials often remains cheaper and easier than collecting, transporting, and processing spent batteries.<ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Katwala|first=Amit|title=The spiralling environmental cost of our lithium battery addiction|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/lithium-batteries-environment-impact|magazine=Wired UK|access-date=September 19, 2025}}</ref> However, since 2018, recycling processes have improved significantly, and recovering lithium, manganese, aluminum, and graphite is now possible at industrial scales.<ref name="ATZ_WORLDWIDE">{{Cite web|title=ATZ WORLDWIDE|url=https://www.uacj-automobile.com/en/technical-information/201906_03.html|access-date=14 June 2019|website=uacj-automobile.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190711155940/https://www.uacj-automobile.com/en/technical-information/201906_03.html|archive-date=11 July 2019}}</ref>

Re-use of the battery is preferred over complete recycling as there is less [[embodied energy]] in the process. As these batteries are a lot more reactive than classical vehicle waste like tire rubber, there are significant risks to stockpiling used batteries.<ref>{{Cite journal |date=2012 |title=A General Discussion of Li Ion Battery Safety |journal=Electrochemical Society Interface |doi=10.1149/2.f03122if |bibcode=2012ECSIn..21b..37D |issn=1944-8783 |last1=Doughty|first1=Daniel H.|last2=Roth|first2=E. Peter|volume=21|issue=2|page=37}}</ref>

==== Pyrometallurgical recovery ====

The [[pyrometallurgy|pyrometallurgical]] method uses a high-temperature furnace to reduce the components of the metal oxides in the battery to an alloy of Co, Cu, Fe, and Ni. This is the most common and commercially established method of recycling and can be combined with other similar batteries to increase smelting efficiency and improve [[thermodynamics]]. The metal [[current collector]]s aid the smelting process, allowing whole cells or modules to be melted at once.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Georgi-Maschler|first1=T.|last2=Friedrich|first2=B.|last3=Weyhe|first3=R.|last4=Heegn|first4=H.|last5=Rutz|first5=M. |date=2012-06-01 |title=Development of a recycling process for Li-ion batteries |journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=207|pages=173–182 |doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2012.01.152|issn=0378-7753}}</ref> The product of this method is a collection of metallic alloy, [[slag]], and gas. At high temperatures, the polymers used to hold the battery cells together burn off and the metal alloy can be separated through a hydrometallurgical process into its separate components. The slag can be further refined or used in the [[cement]] industry. The process is relatively risk-free and the [[Exothermic process|exothermic]] reaction from polymer combustion reduces the required input energy. However, in the process, the plastics, [[electrolyte]]s, and lithium salts will be lost.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Lv|first1=Weiguang|last2=Wang|first2=Zhonghang|last3=Cao|first3=Hongbin|last4=Sun|first4=Yong|last5=Zhang|first5=Yi|last6=Sun|first6=Zhi | date = 2018-01-11 | title = A Critical Review and Analysis on the Recycling of Spent Lithium-Ion Batteries |journal=ACS Sustainable Chemistry & Engineering|volume=6|issue=2|pages=1504–1521 |doi=10.1021/acssuschemeng.7b03811 |bibcode=2018ASCE....6.1504L |issn=2168-0485 }}</ref>

==== Hydrometallurgical metals reclamation ====

This method involves the use of [[aqueous solution]]s to remove the desired metals from the cathode. The most common reagent is [[sulfuric acid]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Ferreira|first1=Daniel Alvarenga |last2=Prados |first2=Luisa Martins Zimmer |last3=Majuste|first3=Daniel |last4=Mansur|first4=Marcelo Borges  | date = 2009-02-01 | title = Hydrometallurgical separation of aluminium, cobalt, copper and lithium from spent Li-ion batteries |journal=Journal of Power Sources|volume=187|issue=1|pages=238–246  | doi = 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2008.10.077|bibcode=2009JPS...187..238F |issn=0378-7753}}</ref> Factors that affect the leaching rate include the concentration of the acid, time, temperature, solid-to-liquid-ratio, and [[reducing agent]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=He|first1=Li-Po |last2=Sun|first2=Shu-Ying |last3=Song|first3=Xing-Fu |last4=Yu|first4=Jian-Guo |date=June 2017 |title=Leaching process for recovering valuable metals from the LiNi 1/3 Co 1/3 Mn 1/3 O 2 cathode of lithium-ion batteries |journal=Waste Management|volume=64|pages=171–181 |doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2017.02.011|pmid=28325707 |bibcode=2017WaMan..64..171H |issn=0956-053X}}</ref> It is experimentally proven that H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> acts as a reducing agent to speed up the rate of [[Leaching (metallurgy)|leaching]] through the reaction:<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Li |first=Liang |date=2010-03-15 |title=Recovery of cobalt and lithium from spent lithium ion batteries using organic citric acid as leachant |journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials |volume=176 |issue=1–3 |pages=288–293 |doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.11.026 |pmid=19954882 |bibcode=2010JHzM..176..288L |quote=H₂O₂ was used as a reducing agent to enhance the leaching efficiency of cobalt and lithium.}}</ref>

Once leached, the metals can be extracted through [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitation]] reactions controlled by changing the pH level of the solution. Cobalt, the most expensive metal, can then be recovered in the form of sulfate, oxalate, hydroxide, or carbonate. More recently,{{When|date=April 2025}} recycling methods experiment with the direct reproduction of the cathode from the leached metals. In these procedures, concentrations of the various leached metals are premeasured to match the target cathode and then the cathodes are directly synthesized.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Sa|first1=Qina |last2=Gratz|first2=Eric |last3=Heelan|first3=Joseph A. |last4=Ma|first4=Sijia |last5=Apelian|first5=Diran |last6=Wang|first6=Yan  | date = 2016-04-04 | title = Synthesis of Diverse LiNixMnyCozO2 Cathode Materials from Lithium Ion Battery Recovery Stream|journal=Journal of Sustainable Metallurgy|volume=2|issue=3|pages=248–256  | doi = 10.1007/s40831-016-0052-x|bibcode=2016JSusM...2..248S |s2cid=99466764 |issn=2199-3823|doi-access=free}}</ref>

The main issues with this method, however, are the large volume of [[solvent]] required and the high cost of neutralization. Although it is easy to shred up the battery, mixing the cathode and anode at the beginning complicates the process, so they will also need to be separated. Unfortunately, the current design of batteries makes the process extremely complex and it is difficult to separate the metals in a closed-loop battery system. Shredding and dissolving may occur at different locations.<ref>{{cite web |title=Li-ion battery recycling company Li-Cycle closes Series C round |url=https://www.greencarcongress.com/2020/11/20201119-licycle.html |website=Green Car Congress |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201129011325/https://www.greencarcongress.com/2020/11/20201119-licycle.html |archive-date=29 November 2020 |date=29 November 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>

==== Direct recycling ====

Direct recycling is the removal of the cathode or anode from the electrode, reconditioned, and then reused in a new battery. Mixed metal-oxides can be added to the new electrode with very little change to the crystal morphology. The process generally involves the addition of new lithium to replenish the loss of lithium in the cathode due to degradation from cycling. Cathode strips are obtained from the dismantled batteries, then soaked in [[N-Methyl-2-pyrrolidone|NMP]], and undergo sonication to remove excess deposits. It is treated hydrothermally with a solution containing LiOH/Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> before annealing.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Shi |first1=Yang|last2=Chen |first2=Gen|last3=Liu|first3=Fang|last4=Yue|first4=Xiujun|last5=Chen|first5=Zheng |date=2018-06-26 |title=Resolving the Compositional and Structural Defects of Degraded LiNixCoyMnzO2 Particles to Directly Regenerate High-Performance Lithium-Ion Battery Cathodes |journal=ACS Energy Letters|volume=3 |issue=7|pages=1683–1692|doi=10.1021/acsenergylett.8b00833 |bibcode=2018ACSEL...3.1683S |s2cid=139435709|issn=2380-8195}}</ref>

This method is extremely cost-effective for noncobalt-based batteries as the raw materials do not make up the bulk of the cost. Direct recycling avoids the time-consuming and expensive purification steps, which is great for low-cost cathodes such as LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> and LiFePO<sub>4</sub>. For these cheaper cathodes, most of the cost, embedded energy, and [[carbon footprint]] is associated with the manufacturing rather than the raw material.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Dunn|first1=Jennifer B.|last2=Gaines|first2=Linda|last3=Sullivan|first3=John|last4=Wang|first4=Michael Q. |date=2012-10-30 |title=Impact of Recycling on Cradle-to-Gate Energy Consumption and Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Automotive Lithium-Ion Batteries |journal=Environmental Science & Technology|volume=46|issue=22|pages=12704–12710 |doi=10.1021/es302420z|pmid=23075406|bibcode=2012EnST...4612704D|issn=0013-936X}}</ref> It is experimentally shown that direct recycling can reproduce similar properties to pristine graphite.

The drawback of the method lies in the condition of the retired battery. In the case where the battery is relatively healthy, direct recycling can cheaply restore its properties. However, for batteries where the state of charge is low, direct recycling may not be worth the investment. The process must also be tailored to the specific cathode composition, and therefore the process must be configured to one type of battery at a time.<ref>{{Cite journal | date = April 2019 | title = Recycle spent batteries|journal=Nature Energy|volume=4|issue=4|page=253 | doi = 10.1038/s41560-019-0376-4|bibcode=2019NatEn...4..253.|s2cid=189929222|issn=2058-7546|doi-access=free}}</ref> Lastly, in a time with rapidly developing battery technology, the design of a battery today may no longer be desirable a decade from now, rendering direct recycling ineffective.

==== Physical materials separation ====
Physical materials separation recovered materials by mechanical crushing and exploiting physical properties of different components such as particle size, density, ferromagnetism and hydrophobicity. Copper, aluminum and steel casing can be recovered by sorting. The remaining materials, called "black mass", which is composed of nickel, cobalt, lithium and manganese, need a secondary treatment to recover.<ref name="Ciez-2019">{{cite journal |last1=Ciez |first1=Rebecca E. |last2=Whitacre |first2=J. F. |date=February 2019 |title=Examining different recycling processes for lithium-ion batteries |journal=Nature Sustainability |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=148–156 |doi=10.1038/s41893-019-0222-5 |bibcode=2019NatSu...2..148C |issn=2398-9629 |s2cid=188116440}}</ref>

==== Biological metals reclamation ====
For the biological metals reclamation or bio-leaching, the process uses microorganisms to digest metal oxides selectively. Then, recyclers can reduce these oxides to produce metal nanoparticles. Although bio-leaching has been used successfully in the mining industry, this process is still nascent to the recycling industry and plenty of opportunities exists for further investigation.<ref name="Ciez-2019"/>

==== Electrolyte recycling ====
Electrolyte recycling consists of two phases. The collection phase extracts the electrolyte from the spent Li-ion battery. This can be achieved through mechanical processes, [[distillation]], freezing, [[Liquid–liquid extraction|solvent extraction]], and [[supercritical fluid extraction]]. Due to the volatility, flammability, and sensitivity of the electrolyte, the collection process poses a greater difficulty than the collection process for other components of a Li-ion battery. The next phase consists of separation/electrolyte regeneration. Separation consists of isolating the individual components of the electrolyte. This approach is often used for the direct recovery of the Li salts from the organic solvents. In contrast, regeneration of the electrolyte aims to preserve the electrolyte composition by removing impurities which can be achieved through filtration methods.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Niu |first1=Bo |last2=Xu |first2=Zhenming |last3=Xiao |first3=Jiefeng |last4=Qin |first4=Yufei |date=2023-07-12 |title=Recycling Hazardous and Valuable Electrolyte in Spent Lithium-Ion Batteries: Urgency, Progress, Challenge, and Viable Approach |url=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.chemrev.3c00174 |journal=Chemical Reviews |language=en |volume=123 |issue=13 |pages=8718–8735 |doi=10.1021/acs.chemrev.3c00174 |pmid=37339582 |issn=0009-2665}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Ruihan |last2=Shi |first2=Xingyi |last3=Esan |first3=Oladapo Christopher |last4=An |first4=Liang |date=2022-06-11 |title=Organic Electrolytes Recycling From Spent Lithium-Ion Batteries |journal=Global Challenges |language=en |volume=6 |issue=12 |article-number=2200050 |doi=10.1002/gch2.202200050 |issn=2056-6646 |pmc=9749074 |pmid=36532239|bibcode=2022GloCh...600050Z }}</ref>

The recycling of the electrolytes, which consists 10–15 wt.% of the Li-ion battery, provides both an economic and environmental benefits. These benefits include the recovery of the valuable Li-based salts and the prevention of hazardous compounds, such as volatile organic compounds ([[Volatile organic compound|VOCs]]) and carcinogens, being released into the environment.

Compared to electrode recycling, less focus is placed on recycling the electrolyte of Li-ion batteries which can be attributed to lower economic benefits and greater process challenges. Such challenges can include the difficulty associated with recycling different electrolyte compositions,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Wang |first1=Qingsong |last2=Jiang |first2=Lihua |last3=Yu |first3=Yan |last4=Sun |first4=Jinhua |date=2019-01-01 |title=Progress of enhancing the safety of lithium ion battery from the electrolyte aspect |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2211285518307614 |journal=Nano Energy |volume=55 |pages=93–114 |doi=10.1016/j.nanoen.2018.10.035 |bibcode=2019NEne...55...93W |issn=2211-2855}}</ref> removing side products accumulated from electrolyte decomposition during its runtime,<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Mönnighoff |first1=Xaver |last2=Friesen |first2=Alex |last3=Konersmann |first3=Benedikt |last4=Horsthemke |first4=Fabian |last5=Grützke |first5=Martin |last6=Winter |first6=Martin |last7=Nowak |first7=Sascha |date=2017-06-01 |title=Supercritical carbon dioxide extraction of electrolyte from spent lithium ion batteries and its characterization by gas chromatography with chemical ionization |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0378775317304202 |journal=Journal of Power Sources |volume=352 |pages=56–63 |doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.03.114 |bibcode=2017JPS...352...56M |issn=0378-7753}}</ref> and removal of electrolyte adsorbed onto the electrodes.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Zhang |first1=Xiaoxiao |last2=Li |first2=Li |last3=Fan |first3=Ersha |last4=Xue |first4=Qing |last5=Bian |first5=Yifan |last6=Wu |first6=Feng |last7=Chen |first7=Renjie |date=2018 |title=Toward sustainable and systematic recycling of spent rechargeable batteries |url=https://xlink.rsc.org/?DOI=C8CS00297E |journal=Chemical Society Reviews |language=en |volume=47 |issue=19 |pages=7239–7302 |doi=10.1039/C8CS00297E |pmid=30124695 |issn=0306-0012}}</ref> Due to these challenges, current pyrometallurgical methods of Li-ion battery recycling forgo electrolyte recovery, releasing hazardous gases upon heating.
