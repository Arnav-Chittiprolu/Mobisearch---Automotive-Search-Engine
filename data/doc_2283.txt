Do not fill this in! ===Switzerland===
Switzerland has a car import tax which is 4% of the purchase price (before adding the VAT) which is waived for electric cars.<ref name=ezv>{{cite web|url=http://www.ezv.admin.ch/zollinfo_privat/04392/04393/04394/index.html?lang=de|title=Eidgenössische Zollverwaltung|date=2013-05-21|access-date=2014-03-08|archive-date=2014-03-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140308090139/http://www.ezv.admin.ch/zollinfo_privat/04392/04393/04394/index.html?lang=de|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=xtares>{{Cite web|url=http://xtares.admin.ch|title=swiss customs database}}</ref> Since [[Switzerland]] consists of [[cantons of Switzerland|26&nbsp;cantons]] which have their own legislature, additional incentives for plug-in electric vehicles differ between the respective regions. The current list can be downloaded from the website of the Swiss Department of Energy.<ref name=bfe>{{cite web|url=http://www.bfe.admin.ch/energieetikette/00886/02038/index.html?lang=de&dossier_id=02083|title=Bundesamt für Energie|date=2014-02-04}}</ref>

There are no additional incentives on the actual purchase price, but some cantons offer road tax cuts. The Swiss road tax is a yearly recurring fixed amount calculated based on the specifications of the tax payers car. Currently, only the cantons [[Canton of Glarus|Glarus]] (GL), [[Canton of Solothurn|Solothurn]] (SO), [[Ticino]] (TI) and [[Canton of Zurich|Zurich]] (ZH) are completely waiving the tax for plug-in electric vehicles.

;Calculation example for [[Canton of Zurich|Zurich]]

Based on a usual car with the following specification:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stva.zh.ch/internet/sicherheitsdirektion/stva/de/StVAgeb/GEBva14/VArechner.html|title=Verkehrsabgabenrechner|work=zh.ch|date=21 March 2025 }}</ref>
* Engine: 2 L
* Total weight: 1800&nbsp;kg
* Energy efficiency: C
* Year: 2013

The resulting tax to be paid per year will be {{CHF|278}}. Hence when calculating with a life expectancy of 10 years, the car owner in this example might save around {{CHF|2,780}} when buying a plug-in electric car.

However, since the [[Fuel tax|tax on fossil fuels]] are relatively high in all European countries, including Switzerland, there is still an indirect, but quite strong incentive for car buyers to decide for energy efficient vehicles.

Based on the following examples:
* Fuel economy: {{Convert|7.8|L/100km|mpgUS|abbr=on}} unleaded
* Driving habits: {{Convert|15000|km|abbr=on}} per year
* Fuel tax: {{CHF| 0.7312}} per liter ({{CHF|2.7679}} per gallon)
* Carbon tax (since January 1, 2014): {{CHF|0.1414}} per liter ({{CHF|0.5353}} per gallon)

The resulting taxes on the burned fuels will be around {{CHF|1,021}} per year, which results in {{CHF|10,210}} over the car's 10-year lifetime.
