Help From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This category has a backlog that requires the attention of willing editors. This notice will hide itself when this category has fewer than 50 items. ( recount ) This is a tracking category . It is used to build and maintain a list or lists of pages—primarily for the sake of the lists themselves and their use in article and category maintenance. It is not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme . More information: This category is hidden on its member pages —unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. These categories are used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse " (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or subcategories into a larger, more efficient list ( discriminated by classifications ). Typically, tracking categories are automatically populated by templates invoked in pages or by the MediaWiki software (see Special:TrackingCategories for an overview of the latter). Administrators: Please do not delete this category as empty! This category may be empty occasionally or even most of the time. This category allows for tracking all stub articles .
