https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccharification

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Chemical change wherein a sugar splits off a simple sugar Saccharification is a term in biochemistry for denoting any chemical change wherein a monosaccharide molecule remains intact after becoming unbound from another saccharide. [ 1 ] For example, when a carbohydrate is broken into its component sugar molecules by hydrolysis (e.g., sucrose being broken down into glucose and fructose ). [ 2 ] Enzymes such as amylases (e.g. in saliva ) and glycoside hydrolase (e.g. within the brush border of the small intestine ) are able to perform exact saccharification through enzymatic hydrolysis . [ 3 ] Through thermolysis , saccharification can also occur as a transient result, among many other possible effects, during caramelization .
