It was produced over two generations in a four-door, five passenger configuration. The nameplate derives from the Latin equus , meaning "horse." A second generation was released in 2009. [ 5 ] As of August 2014, it was sold in South Korea, Russia, China, United States, Canada, Central America, and South America — as well as in the Middle East under the Hyundai Centennial (현대 센테니얼) nameplate. On November 4, 2015, Hyundai officially announced it would move the Genesis model to Hyundai's new luxury vehicle division, Genesis Motor . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The 2016 successor to the Hyundai Equus was rebranded as Genesis G90 [ 8 ] (EQ900 in Korea until 2018).

Hyundai said that it was making a full-size sedan to compete with Mercedes-Benz S-Class and BMW 7 Series in the Korean market. In reality, it was competing against its domestic rival, the SsangYong Chairman . Hyundai had great success with the Equus in Korea, but very few were exported to other countries. One was exported for the 2001 New York International Auto Show to gauge the reaction of U.S. consumers. Hyundai identified the car to the U.S. consumers as the Hyundai LZ450 luxury sedan but it was not sold in the United States. The first generation was designed by Mitsubishi Motors, who had their own version called the Proudia . It was jointly manufactured by both companies. [ 9 ] The first-generation model was introduced in 1999 as a front-wheel-drive car measuring 5.1 metres (200.8 in) long and 1.9 metres (74.8 in) wide. A long-wheelbase limousine model was available exclusively for the Korean domestic market, and at ₩92,510,000 South Korean won for the 2008 model with a V8 and no options, was the most expensive model in the company's lineup. The first-generation Equus extended-length limousine was also mechanically related to the Mitsubishi Dignity limousine for the Japanese market. The first-generation Equus were sold in South Korea , China , and the Middle East .  A very limited number, badged as the Centennial, were made available for some western European markets in the early and mid-2000s. At first, there were two engine types: a 3.5 Sigma V6 and 4.5 8A80 (Omega) V8 engine . After a few months, the 3.0 Sigma V6 engine type was added. Two versions were available: a sedan (3.0, 3.5 and 4.5) and a limousine (3.5 and 4.5). In Japan, under the name of Mitsubishi Dignity (limousine version) and Mitsubishi Proudia (sedan version), about 2,000 units were sold. Specifically, the 4.5 8A80 (Omega) V8 engine was a GDI (Gasoline Direct Injection) type engine, which was designed and developed by Mitsubishi Motors. This engine was optimized for premium unleaded gasoline fuel, but there was little opportunity to get this type of fuel in Korea at that time. So, most of these engines used normal unleaded gasoline fuel and then had significant performance issues, resulting in complaints from drivers. Finally, Hyundai Motors modified this engine from a GDI Type to a MPI (Multi Point Injection) type to solve the issue. It added curtain airbags in 2001 and active head restraints in 2002. New Equus [ edit ] In 2003, Hyundai presented their 'New Equus', changing the hood design and some of interior. A 7-inch screen for the rear seat, Xenon headlamps, front parking sensors, etc. were newly offered. It introduced seat ventilation cooling and heating, climate control with air purifier (2003), Alcantara leather seats (2007). From 2005, 3.0 and 3.5 Sigma V6 engine types were changed to 3.3 and 3.8 Lambda V6 engine types which were designed and developed by Hyundai Motors. But the automatic transmission was not changed. Hyundai officially ceased the production of 1st generation Equus in November 2009. A new bigger, rear-wheel drive Equus was launched in March 2009. [ 10 ] Instead of continuing production like Hyundai, Mitsubishi Motors ended the production of the Proudia and the Dignity around the time of the introduction of this model. Limousine model [ edit ] 1st gen limousine model A limousine model was made for the Korean market. Equus Limousines have been used by famous company owners in Korea as well as foreign VIPs. Second generation (VI; 2009) [ edit ] Motor vehicle Second generation Overview Model code VI Also called Hyundai Centennial Production 2009–2015 Model years 2010–2016 Assembly South Korea: Ulsan Russia: Kaliningrad [ 11 ] Body and chassis Layout Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive Platform Hyundai M1 Related Hyundai Genesis Kia Quoris/K900/K9 Powertrain Engine Petrol : 3.8 L Lambda II MPi V6 3.8 L Lambda II GDi V6 4.6 L Tau MPi V8 5.0 L Tau MPi V8 5.0 L Tau GDi V8 Transmission 6-speed automatic 8-speed automatic Dimensions Wheelbase 3,045 mm (119.9 in) (Sedan) 3,345 mm (131.7 in) (Limousine) Length 5,160 mm (203.1 in) (Sedan) 5,460 mm (215.0 in) (Limousine) Width 1,900 mm (74.8 in) Height 1,490–1,495 mm (58.7–58.9 in) Curb weight 1,875–2,040 kg (4,134–4,497 lb) (Sedan) 2,040–2,150 kg (4,497–4,740 lb) (Limousine) Initial version [ edit ] Hyundai Equus VS460 GLS (Chile) The second generation Equus, codename "VI", was unveiled at  the Grand Hyatt Seoul . [ 12 ] Unlike the old Equus, the VI has a rear-wheel drive architecture, a longer wheelbase, and a different engine. [ 10 ] The VI is based on an all-new platform, developed in-house by the Hyundai Motor Corporation. The South Korean domestic market Equus was available as a 3.8L "Prime" and a 4.6L "Prestige." It is the most expensive model in the company's lineup. It launched in the People's Republic of China in August 2009. The Hyundai Equus was listed in the '10 exciting cars for 2010' from Forbes . [ 13 ] The US model was announced in 2009 Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance, [ 14 ] and was unveiled in 2010 New York Auto Show. [ 15 ] Early US model includes the same 4.6L V8 engine as the Genesis except with 10 hp (7 kW) more than the current version. This puts the total engine output at 385 hp (287 kW) with 333 lb⋅ft (451 N⋅m). [ 16 ] The North American Equus features a badge attached on the hood as opposed to the hood ornament, the grille features a horizontal grid pattern like its Genesis sibling as opposed to the vertical one on international models, and an included iPad device with an Equus user's guide application pre-installed as opposed to a traditional owner's manual. [ 17 ] It was the first Hyundai with an Electronically controlled Air Suspension (EAS) and Continuous Damping Control (CDC). It was also the first Hyundai with Vehicle Stability Management (VSM) collision avoidance system that manages electronic stability control , the electronic parking brake , radar smart cruise control and the seatbelt tensioning system for optimal safety. Equus Limousine [ edit ] 2010 Hyundai Equus Limousine The long-wheelbase version Equus was unveiled in September 2009. It is 300 mm (11.8 in) longer than the sedan version. Engine choices include Lambda 3.8L and Tau 5.0L engines. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] The limousine model has an exclusive horizontal cross-bar radiator grille, as well as features such as a power-driven footrest, rear-seat leg support and a massage system. [ 20 ] Hyundai also developed an armoured vehicle based on the limousine, with an enlarged 5.5L version of the V8 engine. [ 21 ] In September 2009, Hyundai delivered three bulletproof limousine versions of the luxury sedan Equus to the South Korea Presidential Security Service to be used as the official state car . Hyundai designed this vehicle with a special alloy, with an automatic cooling system in case of fire as well as bulletproof windows. [ 22 ] The first-built armoured limousine was donated to Blue House . [ 23 ] A modified Hyundai Equus was donated to Costa Rica and is currently used as the presidential car. The limousine was available only in South Korea and Russia. The Russian version had the same price tag as the South Korean version. Powertrain update (2011) [ edit ] Hyundai introduced 3.8 L and 5.0 L GDi engines to replace the existing 3.8 L, 4.6 L and 5.0L MPi engines with a new 8-speed automatic transmission replacing the older 6-speed transmission on all applications. [ 24 ] For North America, the updated Equus will debut as a 2012 model year with the 5.0L V8 engine rated 429 hp (320 kW) and 376 lb⋅ft (510 N⋅m). [ 25 ] The engine updates carried over to the facelifted Hyundai Genesis as well. [ 25 ] Facelift (2013) [ edit ] Updates included new 19-inch alloy wheels, front fascia and grille design, side mirrors, tail lamp graphics, standard LED fog lamps, instrumental panel and center stack, center console and shift lever design, steering wheel control layout with vehicle settings, genuine wood trim selections, rear seat center console controls, ride tuning, sport mode, front suspension bushings, standard Assurance Connected Care & Blue Link, 7-inch TFT LCD cluster display (Signature), 12.3-inch fully digital TFT LCD cluster display (Ultimate), larger 9.2-inch upper center stack LCD display, climate control system offers three distinct cabin temperature zones, standard smart cruise control with stop/start (from 0 mph), proximity smart key with both key fob and card-key types, dual 9.2-inch rear seat entertainment monitors, power door closure, power lumbar for rear outboard seats, standard Assurance Connected Care (3-year complimentary services), standard Rear Cross-traffic Alert, standard Blind Spot Detection (BSD), heads-up display, vehicle multi-view camera system. This Equus was unveiled at the 2013 New York Auto Show. [ 26 ] US models went on sale in 2013 as 2014 model year vehicles. The Tau 5.0 GDi engine is the only engine offered in the US. [ 27 ] In 2013, a shipment of 61 2014 Hyundai Equus sedans carried by South Korean freighter Morning Spruce destined for the United States was adrift for days after the ship had lost engine power in Pacific Ocean. [ 28 ] On 11 March 2014, an Equus sedan was used in the Chilean inauguration ceremony.
