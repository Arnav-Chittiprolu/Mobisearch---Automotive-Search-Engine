An '''automobile repair shop''' (also known regionally as a '''garage''' or a '''workshop''') is an establishment where [[automobile]]s are repaired by [[auto mechanic]]s and [[technician]]s. The customer  interface is typically a [[Customer service representative|service advisor]], traditionally called a service writer.

Automotive garages and repair shops can be divided into following categories:<ref name=":0">{{Cite book |last=Gilles |first=Tim |title=Automotive Service: Inspection, Maintenance, Repair |publisher=Delmar Learning |year=2004 |isbn=1-40181-234-1 |edition=Custom |location=United States of America |pages=16–23 |language=en}}</ref>

=== Service station ===
First appearing in the early 1900s,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Eschner |first=Kat |date=December 1, 2017 |title=A Short Picture History of Gas Stations |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/short-picture-history-gas-stations-180967337/ |website=Smithsonian Magazine}}</ref> many [[Filling station|filling stations]] offered vehicle repair services as part of their [[Filling station attendant|full service]] operation. This once popular trend has declined significantly over the years as many locations found it more profitable to exchange vehicle service bays for grocery isles, which ultimately led to the emergence of the quick oil change industry.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Ames |first=Joe |year=1989 |title=Quick Lube History: 1989 - Quick Oil Change Industry Draws a Crowd |url=https://costaoils.com/quick-lube-history-1989-quick-oil-change-industry-draws-a-crowd/ |website=Costa Oil}}</ref>

=== Lubrication/safety shop ===
Commonly referred to as a quick lube or express service shop, this type of facility specializes in [[Preventive Maintenance|preventive maintenance]] and safety [[Inspection|inspections]] rather than repairs. Product sales are typically limited to automotive fluids, belts and hoses.<ref name=":0" /> With a focus on basic procedures, labor is often performed by [[Entry-level job|entry-level]] technicians which simplifies the business overhead resulting in a less expensive service as compared to a traditional automotive workshop.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Witt |first=Pharaba |title=Cheapest Places to Get Oil Changes |url=https://itstillruns.com/cheapest-places-oil-changes-7487290.html |website=It Still Runs}}</ref> 

=== New car dealership ===
In the United States, new [[car dealership]]s have service departments that are certified by their respective OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) to perform warranty and recall repairs. Customer-pay repairs can also be completed, however most service departments tend to only work on the vehicle [[brand]] of which they are a dealer. Dealership technicians must complete additional training provided by the OEM, and in doing so become specialized and certified for that particular vehicle make.<ref name=":0" />

=== Independent auto repair shop ===
Independent auto repair shops are businesses that are independently owned and operated. In states regulating a smog or emission test, often, independent auto repair shops offer these tests as well. These may also include regional or national chains and franchises. It is rather common for a dealership technician to start this type of competing business after leaving the employment of a new car dealership.<ref name=":0" /> Independent automobile repair shops in the US may also achieve OEM certification through manufacturer sponsored programs.<ref>{{cite web |title=ProFirst Certification |url=http://collision.honda.com/profirst#.U5s9Z41dX7A |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140427083544/http://collision.honda.com/profirst |archive-date=2014-04-27}}</ref> [[European Union]] law (The EC Block Exemption Regulation 1400/2002 (October 2003<ref>{{cite web |title=Independent garages and the Motor Vehicle Block Exemption |url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN05060.pdf |access-date=24 October 2012 |publisher=UK Government}}</ref>)) permits motorists more flexibility in selecting where their car is serviced. Maintenance and service work does not have to be done by the dealership providing that the independent garage uses Original Equipment 'Matching Quality' parts and follows the manufacturer's service schedules. The Block Exemption Regulation (BER) covers service and maintenance during the warranty period and prohibits vehicle manufacturers' warranties from including restrictive conditions.

=== Fleet shop ===
A shop that is dedicated to repairing and maintaining a particular group of vehicles is called a [[Fleet vehicle|fleet]] shop. Common examples of a fleet include [[Taxi|taxi cabs]], [[Police car|police cars]], [[Mail truck|mail trucks]] and [[Vehicle for hire|rental vehicles]]. Similar to a lubrication/safety shop, a fleet shop focuses primarily on preventative maintenance and safety inspections, and will often [[Outsourcing|outsource]] larger or more complex repairs to another repair facility.<ref name=":0" />

=== Engine machine shop ===
Shops that specialize in [[cylinder head]] and [[Engine block|cylinder block]] machining are called engine [[Machine shop|machine shops]]. These facilities utilize large electromechanical machines that are not found in the average automotive repair shop. In the US, engine machining is typically performed by an [[Automotive Service Excellence|ASE certified]] machinist in order to correct worn or damaged engine components as an alternative to component replacement.<ref name=":0" /> Performance engine building is another popular service frequently offered by this type of workshop.{{cn|date=August 2024}}

=== Tire and wheel shop ===
[[File:Senegaltireshop.jpg|thumb|A tire repair shop in Senegal]]
Some repair shops specialize in tires and wheels. These businesses usually have a large inventory of tires and [[Automotive aftermarket|aftermarket]] wheels, some of which may be on display while others require special ordering. In addition to parts, common labor services include tire rotation, balancing and repair as well as wheel alignment which can prevent premature tire wear.<ref name=":0" />

In the [[Philippines]], roadside tire repair shops are called '''vulcanizing shops''' in [[Philippine English]]. They specialize in quickly and cheaply repairing [[flat tire]]s by patching punctures with a rubber compound patch.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Panganiban |first1=Noriel |title="Business as Usual" as the Filipinos Define It (Vulcanizing Shop, Sari-Sari Store, Bakery) – Part 1 |url=http://www.projectpilipinas.com/2017/09/business-as-usual-as-filipinos-define.html |website=Project Pilipinas |date=21 September 2017 |access-date=16 April 2023}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=How to Communicate Better With The Locals |url=https://www.philippinestravelpackage.com/blog/communicate-better-with-locals/ |publisher=PhilippinesTravelPackage.com |access-date=16 April 2023}}</ref>

=== Muffler shop ===
A [[muffler]] shop, also called an [[Exhaust gas|exhaust]] shop, is a business model that concentrates solely on the engine [[exhaust system]]. These facilities utilize large tubing benders which allow a technician to [[Metal fabrication|fabricate]] a new exhaust system out of otherwise straight lengths of pipe.<ref name=":0" /> [[Welding]] is often necessary in this line of work.

=== Auto body ===

Automotive repair shops that specialize in bodywork repair are known as body shops. [[Auto body technician|Auto body technicians]] can perform paintwork repairs to scratches, scuffs and dents, as well as repairs to the bodies of vehicles damaged by [[Traffic collision|collisions]]. Many body shops now offer [[paintless dent repair]] and auto glass replacement. Automotive repair shops that specialize in auto glass repair are known as auto glass repair shops. They offer auto glass repairs to chips, cracks and shattered glass. The types of glass they repair include [[Windshield|windshields]], car windows, [[quarter glass]] and rear windows. This type of damage is often caused by [[hail]], stones, wild animals, fallen trees, [[Motor vehicle theft|automobile theft]] and [[vandalism]].

=== Mobile mechanics ===
Mobile mechanics provide doorstep repair services and home delivery of new and used auto parts of different late model and classic cars whose parts are not widely available in the market.

In countries such as the UK, the mobile car body repair sectors has experienced high growth by way of mobile SMART Repair companies providing mobile car body repair services, such as Bumper Repairs, auto body repair, [[paintless dent repair]] and paintwork defect repairs to private and commercial consumers, typically within the industry framework of refinishing vehicle damage on a localised basis, where the area of damage being repaired is not in excess of an A4 sheet of paper.
