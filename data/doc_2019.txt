A five-door executive car with a hatchback , [ 1 ] the I-Pace was announced in March 2018, with European deliveries beginning in June 2018 and North American deliveries starting in October 2018. The I-Pace was discontinued in 2024 due to slowing sales [ 3 ] and a change in corporate vision. [ 4 ] Development [ edit ] Concept car The Jaguar I-Pace was designed by Ian Callum . [ 5 ] The concept version of the car, described as a five-seater sports car, was unveiled by JLR at the 2016 Los Angeles Motor Show and shown on-road in London in March 2017. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The I-Pace is built by contract manufacturer Magna Steyr in Graz , Austria, [ 8 ] and the production version of the I-Pace was revealed in Graz on 1 March 2018. [ 9 ] It was subsequently showcased for its first public appearance in its production version at the 2018 Geneva International Motor Show. [ 10 ] Some of the electric drive technology [ which? ] has come out of the Jaguar I-Type electric Formula E racing car programme. [ 11 ] Overview [ edit ] 2018MY side 2018MY rear Interior 2023 Facelift Rear view The car has a five-door hatchback body, [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and is classified as an executive car by Euro NCAP and as a medium SUV by the Australasian New Car Assessment Programme . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The Jaguar I-Pace launched with a WLTP -rated range of 292 miles (470 km) [ 12 ] and an EPA -rated range of 234 miles (377 km). In December 2019, software enhancements were released to increase range to an EPA -rated range of 246 miles (396 km). [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The car can ford water up to 500 mm (20 in) deep. [ 15 ] The rear boot holds 656 litres (23 cu ft), [ 16 ] along with 28 litres (1 cu ft) of front boot space. The drag coefficient is 0.29. [ 5 ] The car has all-wheel drive via two motors powered by a 90 kWh LG Chem liquid cooled lithium-ion battery. [ 5 ] Each motor delivers 197 hp (147 kW) and 258 lb⋅ft (350 N⋅m) of torque, for a total power of 395 hp (295 kW) and total torque of 516 lb⋅ft (700 N⋅m). [ 5 ] The 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) time is 4.8 seconds, [ 12 ] and the top speed is electronically limited to 124 mph (200 km/h). [ 17 ] The battery contains 432 pouch cells. [ 18 ] It can charge from 0 to 80 per cent in 85 minutes using 50 kW DC charging, or 45 minutes using a 100 kW charger. Home charging with an AC wall box (7 kW) achieves the same state of charge in 10 hours. [ 17 ] As the I-Pace was initially released with a single-phase 7 kW AC charger, a one-hour charge, would add around 30 km (19 miles) of range. [ 19 ] [ better source needed ] Later 2021 models had 11 kW AC charging, at single-phase or three-phase, depending on market. The car comes with a smartphone app called Jaguar Remote , which can locate the car, report on its locking, alarming and charging status, and start its battery preconditioning or cabin heating/cooling. [ 20 ] Awards [ edit ] Jaguar Chief of Design Ian Callum holds 2019 European Car of the Year trophy for the Jaguar I-Pace The I-Pace has won 62 [ 21 ] international awards.

[ 41 ] In May 2025 Waymo announced it had 1,500 autonomous vehicles (primarily the I-PACE) in operation in four American cities, and would equip "over 2,000" more I-PACEs with its Waymo Driver hardware. [ 42 ] Wireless charging project [ edit ] In June 2020, Jaguar announced its support for a wirelessly charged taxi project in Oslo , Norway . Jaguar gave 25 I-Pace vehicles to taxi company Cabonline, which will use the vehicles to test the charging infrastructure on taxis in the Norwegian capital. Ralf Speth , JLR's then chief executive, said, "The taxi industry is the ideal test bed for wireless charging, and indeed for high-mileage electric mobility across the board." [ dubious – discuss ] .
