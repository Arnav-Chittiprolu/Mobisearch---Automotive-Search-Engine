[[Transportation safety in the United States]] is monitored by various agencies.

Research on the trends in use of heavy vehicles indicate that a significant difference between the US and other countries is the relatively high prevalence of [[pickup truck]]s and [[sport utility vehicle|SUV]]s in the US. A 2003 study by the US [[Transportation Research Board]] found that SUVs and pickup trucks are significantly less safe than passenger cars, that non-US branded vehicles tend to be safer than US branded vehicles, and that the size and weight of a vehicle has a significantly smaller effect on safety than the quality of the vehicle's engineering.<ref>{{Cite web

The US NHTSA has issued relatively few regulations since the mid-1980s; most of the vehicle-based reduction in vehicle fatality rates in the US during the last third of the 20th Century were gained by the initial NHTSA safety standards issued from 1968 to 1984 and subsequent voluntary changes in vehicle design and construction by vehicle manufacturers.<ref>{{Cite book
