It was first unveiled as a prototype in November 2019, featuring a distinctive angular design composed of flat, unpainted stainless steel body panels, drawing comparisons to low-polygon computer models . Originally scheduled for production in late 2021, the vehicle faced multiple delays before entering limited production at Gigafactory Texas in November 2023, with initial customer deliveries occurring later that month. As of 2025 [update] , three variants are available: a tri-motor all-wheel drive (AWD) model marketed as the "Cyberbeast", a dual-motor AWD model, and a single-motor rear-wheel drive (RWD) "Long Range" model. EPA range estimates vary by configuration, from 320 to 350 miles (515 to 565 km). As of 2025 [update] , the Cybertruck is sold in the United States , Mexico , Canada and South Korea . The Cybertruck has been criticized for its production quality and safety concerns while its sales have been described as disappointing. History Background Tesla CEO Elon Musk 's ideas for a pickup truck were first stated publicly in 2012 and 2013, envisioning to build a "Tesla supertruck with crazy torque, dynamic air suspension, and corners like it's on rails". [ 6 ] In early 2014 Musk predicted 4–5 years before work could start on the product, then in a 2015 interview with CNN , Musk stated that the Tesla pickup would be the equivalent of a Ford F-150 . [ 6 ] In mid-2016, the outline for a consumer pickup truck was included in part 2 of the Tesla Master Plan. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Musk suggested that the same chassis could be used for a van and a pickup truck. [ 10 ] In 2017, Musk teased the picture of a "pickup truck that can carry a pickup truck" was displayed at the official reveal for the Tesla Semi and Roadster. [ 6 ] In March 2019, following the Tesla Model Y launch, Musk distributed a teaser image of a vehicle described as having a cyberpunk or Blade Runner style, with the form resembling a futuristic armored personnel carrier . It was rumored to be named the Model B . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] On November 6, 2019, Tesla filed for a trademark on "Cybrtrk", which was granted by the United States Patent and Trademark Office but was later abandoned on August 10, 2020. [ 14 ] 2019 concept Window damage caused by the steel ball impacting during the unveiling event A concept Cybertruck was unveiled in Los Angeles, California , on November 21, 2019 [ 15 ] —the same month, year, and location in which the movie Blade Runner was set. The Cybertruck was launched under a graffiti-themed "Cybertruck" logo. [ 16 ] During the unveiling, Tesla claimed that the Cybertruck's "Armor Glass" windows were virtually unbreakable, but two windows shattered when Franz von Holzhausen threw a metal ball at each of them. [ 17 ] Musk later claimed that the windows were damaged because, in an earlier demonstration, the door had been hit by a sledgehammer that cracked the base of the glass. [ 18 ] Tesla released a video of Cybertruck pulling a rear-wheel-drive Ford F-150 uphill in a tug of war. [ 19 ] News outlets pointed out this was due to the Cybertruck's heavier weight. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Tesla's stated goal was to provide a sustainable energy substitute for the roughly 6,500 fossil-fuel-powered pickup-trucks sold per day in the United States. [ 22 ] At the end of the presentation, a concept Tesla Cyberquad all-terrain vehicle (ATV) was driven onto the bed of the Cybertruck using a built-in ramp in the tailgate. The Cyberquad was plugged into the Cybertruck's onboard power outlet to charge its batteries. The ATV was anticipated for future sale as a Cybertruck option. [ 23 ] Cybertruck prototype on display at the Petersen Automotive Museum In 2019, many social media commentators criticized the sharp contours and unusual exterior shown in the concept vehicle. [ 24 ] The prototype was exhibited at the Petersen Automotive Museum in June 2020 [ 25 ] and returned in November 2022. [ 26 ] Reservations Beginning in November 2019, Tesla accepted Cybertruck reservations with a refundable US$100 deposit. [ 27 ] On November 23, 2019, Musk tweeted that Tesla had received 146,000 reservations in the first 1.5 days after the unveiling. [ 28 ] Musk updated the number of preorders to 250,000 on November 26. [ 29 ] In October 2021, Tesla removed the Cybertruck's pricing and specifications from its website without explanation while still accepting deposits. [ 30 ] At the 2022 annual shareholders meeting, in response to a question, Elon Musk stated that final specifications and pricing would be different from those unveiled on the concept vehicle in 2019. [ 31 ] Preorders were temporarily shut down prior to the delivery event on November 30, 2023. [ 32 ] Since the delivery event, the price for a deposit was increased to $250. [ 33 ] In August 2024, the Cybertruck was readily available for delivery in the U.S. and Tesla shut down the reservation process. [ 34 ] Release Candidate testing in San Mateo, California , during October 2023 Production and offerings In 2019, Elon Musk announced that the Cybertruck would launch in late 2021 with a starting price of US$39,900. The release date was later delayed to 2022, and subsequently to late 2023, with an updated base price of US$60,990. [ 35 ] In May 2022, Tesla stopped taking orders from customers outside North America, and in December 2023, it confirmed that the Cybertruck would be available exclusively in that region. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] While individual imports into the European Union and United Kingdom are possible, type approval restrictions prevent registration for public road use in many countries. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] In June 2023, chief designer Franz von Holzhausen drove an early build Cybertruck to an event at the Petersen Automotive Museum. [ 41 ] The first unit was assembled at Gigafactory Texas in July 2023, [ 42 ] though Tesla later clarified that this was part of pilot production . [ 42 ] Serial production began by November 2023, with production-specification units appearing in Tesla showrooms later that month. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] On November 30, 2023, Tesla hosted a delivery event at Gigafactory Texas, during which it handed over the first trucks to a small selection of customers. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] The event featured a demonstration of the vehicle's armored glass withstanding a baseball thrown by von Holzhausen, [ 47 ] and a promotional video showing the Cybertruck winning a drag race against a Porsche 911 while towing another 911. [ 48 ] Although Musk claimed the race occurred over a 1 ⁄ 4 mile (0.4 km) distance, analysis of the footage suggested it was likely 1 ⁄ 8 mile (0.2 km). [ 49 ] At the same event, Tesla announced pricing and specifications for three variants: a single-motor rear-wheel drive (RWD), a dual-motor all-wheel drive (AWD), and a tri-motor AWD model branded as the "Cyberbeast". The RWD variant, priced at US$60,990, was scheduled for release in 2025 with an estimated range of 250 miles (400 km) and a top speed of 112 mph (180 km/h). The dual-motor AWD model was planned for 2024 at US$79,990, with a range of 340 miles (550 km) and a top speed of 130 mph (210 km/h). The tri-motor Cyberbeast, also scheduled for 2024, was priced at US$99,990. [ 32 ] Compared to initial projections in 2019, base prices had increased by US$21,000–39,000, representing a 53–64% price hike. [ 50 ] In August 2024, Tesla discontinued reservations for the base RWD model. [ 51 ] Until October 2024, only the limited Foundation Series was sold, priced at a US$20,000 premium. This edition, capped at 25,000 units, included early delivery, unique badging, nearly all available accessories, and bundled features such as Full Self-Driving and Powershare capabilities. [ 52 ] Sales of the Foundation Series ended in January 2025, with the company reportedly struggling to sell out all of the vehicles. [ 53 ] Sales of the RWD model, now rebranded as the "Long Range" Cybertruck, resumed in April 2025. Now equipped with a battery that delivered a range of up to 350 miles (560 km), it was priced at US$69,990, a US$9,000 increase from its original listing. Despite offering the longest battery range of any configuration, the Long Range trim omitted several features: it lacked ventilated seats, a rear-seat display, motorized tonneau cover, power outlets, and adaptive air suspension. MotorTrend noted that given the number of omitted features, further price reductions appeared unlikely, casting doubt on Tesla's ability to meet its original US$39,900 price target. [ 54 ] Design Inspiration and styling A lineup of preproduction Tesla vehicles, including the 2019 Cybertruck prototype, the Cyberquad , the second generation Roadster , and the Tesla Semi on display in September 2020 According to Musk, the design of the Cybertruck was inspired by Blade Runner and " Wet Nellie ", the Lotus Esprit driven by James Bond in The Spy Who Loved Me , which doubled as a submarine. [ 55 ] In a Musk biography by Walter Isaacson , Musk's son Saxon was quoted as asking, "Why doesn't the future look like the future?", which Musk used as an inspiration for the design [ 56 ] and repeated during the delivery event. [ 46 ] [ 57 ] Lars Moravy confirmed Musk's involvement: "Elon threw in that it had to drive like a sports car but have all the utility of a pick-up truck... basically, we were sweating bullets". Franz von Holzhausen stated the design process "started [by] unpacking existing pick-up trucks and realis[ing] that the market hasn't changed at all. [...] Like Gandini , we wanted to do something dramatic that changed everything. I had this simple idea right in the beginning: this exoskeleton idea, a low-resolution-looking type of truck. And out of that side project, we made a full-size clay model to show Elon. And he's like, 'that's what we're doing. ' " [ 2 ] Automotive designer Frank Stephenson was critical of the Cybertruck, calling it "almost repulsive" but tempered his criticism by noting it "has the potential to be extremely beautiful" by softening the hard lines. [ 58 ] Fellow designer Adrian Clarke was more unsparing: "The Cybertruck is a low polygon joke that only exists in the fever dreams of Tesla fans that stands high on the smell of Elon Musk's flatulences ." [ 59 ] Giorgetto Giugiaro , credited with originating the "origami" car design trend with the Lotus Esprit , BMW M1 , and DeLorean , stated in 2023 that "when you step outside the norms, it's almost always seen as a provocation [...] the Cybertruck will surely be successful [...] I'm convinced it will find its admirers". [ 60 ] Exterior Production-spec Cybertruck and Cyberquad in a Tesla showroom (November 2023) Tesla Cybertruck in Tokyo , Japan (2024) The 300-series stainless-steel panels have a thickness of 0.071 and 0.055 in (1.8 and 1.4 mm) for the doors and body, respectively, according to a factory tour video. [ 61 ] These panels cannot be stamped like conventional automobile parts, but instead are laser-cut and then bent along straight lines. [ 62 ] [ verification needed ] According to Tesla's VP of Vehicle Engineering Lars Moravy, Tesla had to invent a manufacturing process called "air bending" which shapes the steel with high air pressure without actually touching the surface. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] The Cybertruck's stainless steel finish is prone to rust spots and requires special care such as avoiding washing the vehicle in direct sunlight. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] In 2019, it was reportedly going to use a stainless-steel alloy developed by Tesla [ 67 ] in partnership with Aperam . [ 62 ] Powertrain Tesla has stated that it employs a platform-based approach to the Cybertruck’s powertrain architecture, using a standardized set of components across all drivetrain variants. These include a single design each for the permanent magnet motor, induction motor, motor inverter, and the 15:1 reduction gear set. This approach is used across the tri-motor all-wheel drive (AWD), dual-motor AWD, and single-motor rear-wheel drive (RWD) configurations, with total power outputs ranging from 845 hp (630 kW) in the tri-motor variant to 315 hp (235 kW) in the single-motor version. All powertrain components are integrated into a liquid-cooled subassembly that houses the motor, inverter, and gear set. [ 68 ] The single-motor RWD variant uses a permanent magnet motor mounted on the rear axle, producing up to 315 hp (235 kW). [ 68 ] In the dual-motor AWD configuration, the same permanent magnet motor is used on the rear axle but is downrated to 297 hp (221 kW), paired with a front induction motor producing 303 hp (226 kW), resulting in a combined output of 600 hp (450 kW). [ 69 ] The tri-motor AWD model, marketed as the "Cyberbeast", reconfigures the layout by placing the permanent magnet motor on the front axle and incorporating two induction motors on the rear axle. This setup delivers a peak combined output of 845 hp (630 kW) with 276 hp (206 kW) from the front motor and 284 hp (212 kW) from each rear motor. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Tesla had considered introducing a quad-motor version in late 2021; however, this configuration was not included in the production models released in late 2023.

The AWD & Cyberbeast trims have self-leveling suspension that can compensate for variable load weights, and provide up to 12 inches (30 cm) of suspension travel and 17.4 inches (44 cm) of ground clearance, [ 2 ] with a 35 degree approach angle , and 28 degree departure angle . [ 74 ] Interior view, 2019 prototype The Cybertruck uses steer-by-wire , [ 75 ] allowing all turns to be completed with less than a full rotation of the steering wheel, 340° lock-to-lock , 170° in each direction. [ 76 ] Four-wheel steering , with the rear wheels able to move up to 10°, reduces the turning circle . [ 46 ] [ 77 ] Steering is speed sensitive and damped to mitigate whipping violently in rough terrain. The front motor, when equipped, can deliver all of its torque to one wheel using a locking differential. The handling balance can be adjusted to allow drifting. [ 78 ] Range, battery, and charging The RWD "Long Range" configuration is specified with an estimated range of 350 miles (560 km), [ 54 ] the AWD configuration a range of 325 miles (523 km) and the "Cyberbeast" a range of 300 miles (480 km). [ 76 ] The Cybertruck has an 816 V nominal, 150 Ah [ 69 ] [ 79 ] structural battery pack with a maximum capacity of 123 kWh. [ 2 ] The pack serves as a structural member and is composed of 4680 lithium-ion battery cells ; with a stated energy density of 170 Wh/kg for the entire pack, the overall battery pack weight is approximately 1,590 lb (720 kg). [ 69 ] A 'wade' mode allows the vehicle to cross water up to 2.5 feet (0.76 m) deep. It uses scuba pack to create positive pressure inside the battery to keep water from entering. [ 78 ] A Cybertruck supercharging at a V3 Supercharger The battery is claimed to charge at a maximum rate of 350 kW at charging stations capable of supplying 800 V DC power. [ 2 ] Tesla claims that up to 128 or 136 miles (206 or 219 km) (tri-motor or dual-motor versions, respectively) of range can be added in 15 minutes of charging at 400 V DC. [ 80 ] The onboard charger can accept AC power at a maximum rate of 11.5 kW at 240 V, 48 A. [ 1 ] The 800 V split-pack battery is composed of two 400 V batteries; contactors connect them in parallel for compatibility with widespread 400 V DC charging infrastructure. [ 81 ] [ 82 ] The service menu shows the current state of "Series" or "Parallel" (High Voltage/Charging). [ 83 ] Cancelled range extender When the Cybertruck was unveiled in 2019, Tesla projected versions would be offered with up to 500 miles (800 km) of range. However, the production model released in late 2023 fell far short, offering a maximum of 340 miles (550 km). To bridge the gap between concept and actual range, Tesla announced an optional "range extender" to be offered in the future: a 50 kWh battery pack that would be  installed in the truck bed. Occupying about one-third of the cargo area, the module was expected to add 120 to 130 miles (190 to 210 km) of range. [ 76 ] [ 84 ] At the launch of sales in 2023, Tesla began accepting a US$2,000 deposit from customers interested in the extender. However, by April 2025, the option was removed from Tesla’s website, [ 85 ] and in May, customers were notified by email that Tesla no longer planned to offer the range extender and that deposits would be refunded. [ 86 ] Vehicle-provided power Main article: Tesla Powershare The dual-motor and tri-motor Cybertruck configurations provide up to 9.6 kW of continuous vehicle-to-load (V2L) AC power through five integrated outlets: [ 87 ] Four 120 V, 20 A outlets ( NEMA 5-20 ): two located in the cabin and two in the bed One 240 V, 40 A outlet ( NEMA 14-50 ): located in the bed The RWD configuration offers up to 2.4 kW of continuous V2L power using a mobile charger with an outlet adapter, an optional accessory that connects to the vehicle's charge port and provides 120 V, 20 A AC outlets. The dual-motor and tri-motor variants can also use this accessory, expanding the total number of available outlets to seven. Both the AWD and Cyberbeast Cybertruck variants support up to 11.5 kW of vehicle-to-home (V2H) AC output. [ 88 ] [ 89 ] Enabling bidirectional energy transfer to a home requires a Tesla Wall Connector and either a Tesla Gateway or Powerwall system. [ 90 ] As of 2025 [update] , Powershare does not support vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operation, due to regulatory limitations on exporting power back to the electrical grid. [ 91 ] : 42:42 Mid-voltage electrical system The Cybertruck uses a 48-volt electrical system ; this 48 V DC is fed to electric-powered components including steering actuators, oil pumps at the drive units, window regulator motors, wiper motor, [ 91 ] : 18:02 accessory power feed to the frunk (400 W) [ 92 ] and to the roof (400 W), [ 92 ] three domain controller ECUs , the touchscreen [ 93 ] [ non-primary source needed ] and a 48-volt lithium-ion battery. [ 94 ] [ non-primary source needed ] Interior Interior The Cybertruck has five seats, [ 95 ] two in the front and a three-seat bench in the back row. [ 2 ] The vehicle has an 18.5 in (47 cm) touch-screen display in the front for most of the climate, media, and vehicle controls. [ 95 ] [ 2 ] AWD and Cyberbeast configurations vehicle also have a 9.4 in (24 cm) touch-screen for the rear seat passengers. [ 95 ] [ 2 ] The steering wheel is in the shape of a " squircle ," with a flat top and bottom, and round sides. [ 70 ] Cargo bed Rear view, 2019 prototype Open rear view, Foundation Series The Cybertruck features a cargo bed measuring 6 feet (1.8 m) in length, 4 feet (1.2 m) in width and 67 ft 3 (1.9 m 3 ) in volume. The dual-motor and tri-motor configurations include a motorized roller shutter -style hard tonneau cover. The RWD configuration does not include a tonneau cover as standard, although a soft cover is available as an optional accessory. [ citation needed ] When the tonneau cover is closed, the rear window is blocked. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] To aid visibility when reversing and towing, the feed from rear-facing cameras is displayed on the main touchscreen. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 95 ] In the dual-motor and tri-motor configurations, the bed area includes additional features such as LED light strips along the side walls, a secondary storage compartment located below the main bed floor behind the rear wheels, and integrated 120 V and 240 V AC outlets. [ 98 ] Network The Cybertruck uses a central, bi-directional gigabit Etherloop network with CAN bus satellite networks to operate vehicle systems. The result is that data travels over the same network, as opposed to traditional CAN bus systems which require individual connections, reducing the amount of wiring in the vehicle. Audio travels over the same network. For comparison, while the number of endpoints increased 50% over the Model 3, the amount of cross-vehicle wiring was reduced by two-thirds. [ 68 ] Reception The Cybertruck has been criticized for its poor build quality, malfunctions, and price hikes following reservations. [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ] Conversely, in 2024, Car and Driver magazine gave the Cybertruck a score of 8.5 out of 10, saying that "The buzz-worthy Cybertruck leads with show-pony party tricks and high-tech features, but it's also a capable workhorse with a practical side." [ 102 ] CleanTechnica also gave Cybertruck a positive review, calling it "an engineering and technical marvel, a joy to drive". [ 103 ] Motor Trend has shortlisted it for the magazine's 2025 Truck of the Year, praising its steer-by-wire system and other tech, but criticizing "the design's many compromises". [ 104 ] The Cybertruck's design has been described as "post-apocalyptic" and "dystopian", and its marketing as a reflection of perceived societal decay within America. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] The vehicle has many detractors , who have criticized it for its build quality and safety problems, [ 107 ] [ 108 ] as well as associating it with the politics of Elon Musk , [ 109 ] with detractors giving it derogatory names. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] [ 112 ] The Cybertruck's stainless steel finish was found to be prone to surface contamination that looks like rust, [ 113 ] and requiring special care, such as avoiding washing the vehicle in direct sunlight and drying after rain. [ 65 ] [ 66 ] [ 114 ] [ 115 ] Sales As of June 2024 [update] , a total of 11,688 Tesla Cybertrucks had been sold, [ 116 ] making it the top-selling electric pickup truck in the United States during the first half of the year. [ 117 ] By October 2024, industry estimates placed cumulative sales at approximately 27,185. [ 118 ] However, by November 2024, sales numbers were reported to be lower than initially anticipated, prompting a price reduction. [ 119 ] According to Kelley Blue Book , total sales for 2024 were estimated at 38,965, making it the best-selling electric pickup truck in the United States. [ 120 ] In March 2025, Tesla issued a recall affecting all Cybertrucks produced until 27 February 2025, amounting to 46,096 vehicles. [ 121 ] It was reported that in Q1 2025, sales of the Cybertruck fell significantly compared to the two previous quarters, and it lost the title of the best-selling electric pickup truck in the United States to the Ford F-150 Lightning. [ 122 ] Just over 16,000 vehicles were sold in the first three quarters of 2025. [ 123 ] Initially seen as a market success, the Cybertruck generated significant hype, but this enthusiasm quickly faded, [ 120 ] leading some industry commentators to describe its commercial performance as disappointing and certain analysts labeling it an "undisputable commercial failure". [ 124 ] [ 125 ] In April 2025, Forbes labeled the Cybertruck as the worst automobile industry "flop" in decades, [ 126 ] selling at only 10% of production capacity. [ 127 ] In August 2025, Tesla started selling the Cybertruck in South Korea . [ 128 ] Insurance rates As of August 2025 [update] , insurance policies for Cybertrucks in North America cost their owners approximately US$1,000 more per year than average rates. Multiple insurance providers have terminated existing policies on Cybertrucks en masse , with one company citing "low production volume" and "high repair costs". [ 129 ] Safety concerns In the first year after its release, the Cybertruck had 26 complaints, two investigations, and seven separate recalls, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA): [ 130 ] [ 131 ] As of 2025 [update] , the Cybertruck is not allowed on roads in the United Kingdom due to safety concerns, [ 39 ] and does not meet European Union pedestrian safety standards as a type, although registrations may be individually accepted. [ 40 ] Cybertruck doors are electrically operated so in case of accident or malfunction it may lock occupants inside, preventing saving the occupants. This is made worse because the windows are intentionally designed to be shatter proof and smash resistant. [ 132 ] [ 133 ] [ 134 ] In 2025, the Cybertruck (for builds after April 2025) was crash-tested by the US Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), and received a "good" rating crashworthiness, indicating that the car provides "excellent protection for the driver and solid protection for rear passengers" but a range of acceptable, marginal and poor ratings for other aspects. [ 135 ] [ 136 ] Recalls As of October 2025 [update] , the Cybertruck has been subject to ten recalls. Some have been resolved with software updates which are pushed to the vehicle and installed by customers, but the remaining have required owners to arrange for a repair of their vehicle. [ 121 ] [ 137 ] Recall date Category Issue [ 138 ] Solution January 29, 2024 Electrical Warning lights with a small font size can make critical safety information on the instrument panel hard to read, increasing the risk of a crash software update April 16, 2024 Speed control Accelerator pedal can dislodge and get trapped, causing unwanted acceleration pedal assembly replacement June 18, 2024 Structure Trunk bed trim sail can come loose, creating a road hazard tape or adhesion replacement June 18, 2024 Visibility Windshield wiper can fail, reducing visibility and increasing the risk of a crash wiper motor replacement September 25, 2024 Back-over prevention Delayed rearview image can increase the risk of a crash while backing up software update November 24, 2024 Electrical Inverter fault may cause loss of drive power increasing the risk of a crash drive inverter replacement December 17, 2024 Tires Tire pressure warning-light issue software update March 20, 2025 Structure Stainless steel exterior trim panel could come unglued and detach while driving, creating a road hazard [ 121 ] [ 139 ] trim panel replacement October 23, 2025 Software A software issue caused lights to be too bright, causing visual impairment to the oncoming vehicles. [ 140 ] [ 141 ] Software patch [ 140 ] October 30, 2025 Structure According to an NHTSA announcement, a light bar could get detached and fall into the road, causing a hazard to other vehicles on it [ 142 ] Light bar replacement or additional attachments [ 142 ] Other concerns As of December 2024 [update] , the vehicle had not been crash tested by the NHTSA or by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). [ 143 ] [ 144 ] The Cybertruck's angular design and stiff stainless-steel exterior raised concerns among safety experts that it could hurt pedestrians and cyclists and damage other vehicles on roads. [ 145 ] [ 146 ] Particular concerns were raised about the high stiffness of the "exoskeleton" exterior, potentially reducing crumple zones . The tall, flat front of the truck may increase the severity of injuries to the legs of pedestrians struck. [ 145 ] [ 147 ] Vehicle design experts speculated that it would fail to pass safety testing in various countries, including Australia, due to the risk it poses to both occupants and people outside of the vehicle, especially pedestrians. [ 148 ] [ 149 ] Tesla defended the design, saying that the structures of the Cybertruck would absorb an impact during a crash, [ 145 ] and pointing out that it passed a U.S. regulatory review, although they also admitted that it would be very hard to meet EU pedestrian safety laws. [ 145 ] Elon Musk claimed in 2022 that the Cybertruck could serve as a boat and "cross rivers, lakes and even seas that aren't too choppy." [ 150 ] Like most vehicles, the Cybertruck can float for short periods of time, [ 151 ] but multiple incidents have been reported of Cybertrucks stranded and submerged in water. [ 152 ] [ 153 ] [ 154 ] [ 155 ] Incidents Footage of an IED exploding in a Cybertruck This section is an excerpt from 2025 Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion . [ edit ] On January 1, 2025, at approximately 8:39 a.m. ( PST ), an improvised explosive device exploded in a Tesla Cybertruck parked outside the main entrance of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas in Paradise, Nevada , United States. The vehicle's sole occupant died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound to the head immediately prior to the explosion and seven bystanders were injured by the blast. Authorities found that the vehicle contained firework mortars and gas canisters , which had fueled the explosion and fire.
