To change this template's initial visibility, the |state= parameter may be used: {{ Steam engine configurations | state = collapsed }} will show the template collapsed, i.e. hidden apart from its title bar. {{ Steam engine configurations | state = expanded }} will show the template expanded, i.e. fully visible. Editors can experiment in this template's sandbox ( create | mirror ) and testcases ( create ) pages. Subpages of this template .
