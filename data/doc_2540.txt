Launched on 28 February 2022, the scheme covers nine streets in the city centre of Oxford . All non- electric vehicles (including hybrids ) driving on these roads between 7 am to 7 pm are subject to a fee between £2 and £10, which is expected to double in 2025. History [ edit ] In 2017, a £30,000 joint study was launched by Oxfordshire County Council and Oxford City Council to determine whether a zero emission zone would be a useful way to reduce air pollution in the city centre and along the main transport routes. [ 1 ] The city had already been a low-emission zone since 2014, which applied to buses, [ 1 ] since buses accounted for up to 80% of the pollution in the city centre. [ 2 ] At the time of the original study, Oxford was slated to become the UK's second city LEZ after London introduced one in 2008 . [ 2 ] Subsequently, managed clean air zones have been introduced in several other cities, including Bath, Bristol [ 3 ] and Tyneside. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Implementation [ edit ] A consultation was put in place in 2020, with the hope of launching the ZEZ in December. [ 6 ] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic , this was delayed. [ 7 ] The scheme was approved by both councils in March 2021, [ 8 ] and was launched for nine streets on 28 February 2022 as a pilot program. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Oxford's ZEZ was the first of its kind in the UK. [ 11 ] Operation [ edit ] Unlike other low emission schemes in the United Kingdom, which operate 24/7, the Oxford ZEZ is in operation from 7 am to 7 pm daily, and applies to all non-electric vehicles, including hybrids. The charges for petrol, diesel and hybrid vehicles range from £2 to £10, with the most polluting vehicles charged more. However, as of 2024 [update] , these fees remain lower than London's £12.50 Ultra Low Emissions charge. [ 12 ] The initial proposals could more accurately be described as a "congestion charge", as any vehicle can enter on payment of a charge but this will change in the future. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The ambition for the scheme is that it will gradually expand to cover most of Oxford by 2035. This plan means that Oxford could become the world's first transport-carbon emission-free city. [ 15 ] The fees are expected to double in August 2025.
