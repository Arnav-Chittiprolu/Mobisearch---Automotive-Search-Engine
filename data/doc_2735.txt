Light-duty tires for passenger vehicles carry loads in the range of {{Convert|250|to|500|kg|lb}} on the drive wheel. Light-to-medium duty trucks and vans carry loads in the range of {{convert|500|to|1500|kg|lb}} on the drive wheel.<ref name="Duffy-2015">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-iVACgAAQBAJ&q=%22truck+tire%22+%22heavy+duty%22&pg=PA663 |title=Fundamentals of Medium/Heavy Duty Commercial Vehicle Systems |last1=Duffy |first1=Owen C. |last2=Wright |first2=Gus |date=2015-07-20 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Publishers |isbn=9781284041170 |pages=663–672|language=en}}</ref> They are differentiated by [[Tire code|speed rating]] for different vehicles, including (starting from the lowest speed to the highest): winter tires, light truck tires, entry-level car tires, sedans and vans, sport sedans, and high-performance cars.<ref name=":0A" /> Apart from road tires, there are special categories:

* [[Snow tire]]s are designed for use on [[snow]] and [[ice]]. They have a [[tire tread|tread]] design with larger gaps than those on summer tires, increasing [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] on snow and ice. Such tires that have passed a specific winter traction performance test are entitled to display a "Three-Peak Mountain Snow Flake" symbol on their sidewalls. Tires designed for winter conditions are optimized to drive at temperatures below {{convert|7|°C}}. Some snow tires have metal or ceramic studs that protrude from the tire to increase traction on hard-packed snow or ice. Studs abrade dry pavement, causing dust and creating wear in the wheel path.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://cooper.co.uk/shop/asphalt-testing/prall-tester/|title=Prall Tester - Studded Tyre Wear Test |website=cooper.co.uk |publisher=Cooper Research Technology |access-date=1 September 2014}}</ref> Regulations that require the use of snow tires or permit the use of studs vary by country in Asia and Europe, and by state or province in North America.
* All-season tires are typically rated for mud and snow (M+S). These tires have tread gaps that are smaller than snow tires and larger than conventional tires. They are quieter than snow tires on clear roads, but less capable on snow or ice.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9EV9-xiiJzcC&q=m%2Bs+tire+rating&pg=PA35 |title=Wheel and Tire Performance Handbook |last=Newton |first=Richard |date=2007 |publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn=9781610592512 |location=St. Paul |page=35}}</ref>
* All-terrain tires are designed to have adequate traction off-road, yet have benign handling and noise characteristics for highway driving.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=X95PU39mzSMC&q=%22all-terrain+tire%22&pg=PA17 |title=Jeep 4X4 Performance Handbook |last=Allen |first=Jim |publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=9781616730536|language=en}}</ref> Such tires are rated better on snow and rain than street tires and "good" on ice, rock, and sand.<ref name="Hanseen-2018">{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tLJwDwAAQBAJ&q=%22mud+tire%22&pg=PA99 |title=Jeep TJ 1997-2006: How to Build & Modify |last=Hanseen|first=Michael|date=2018-08-15|publisher=CarTech |isbn=9781613254288 |language=en}}</ref>
* Mud-terrain tires have a deeper, more open tread for good grip in mud, than all-terrain tires, but perform less well on pavement.<ref name=":0B" />
* High-performance tires are rated for speeds up to {{Convert|168|mph|km/h|order=flip}} and ultra-high-performance tires are rated for speeds up to {{Convert|186|mph|km/h|order=flip}}, but have harsher ride characteristics and durability.<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=i2ZmgxbTS3AC&q=%22high-performance+tire%22&pg=PA47 |title=High-Performance Handling for Street or Track |last=Alexander |first=Don |date=2013-02-15|publisher=Motorbooks|isbn=9780760339947|language=en}}</ref>
* Electric vehicles have unique demands on tires due to the combination of weight (resulting in new load index), higher torque, and requirements for lower rolling resistance.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gitlin |first1=Jonathan M. |title=Electric vehicles ask a lot of their tires—here's why |url= https://arstechnica.com/cars/2021/12/why-electric-vehicle-tires-are-challenging-to-make/ |access-date=22 December 2021 |work=Ars Technica |date=16 December 2021}}</ref>

Other types of light-duty automotive tires include run-flat tires and race car tires:

* [[Run-flat tire]]s eliminates the need for a spare tire because they can be traveled on at a reduced speed in the event of a puncture, using a stiff sidewall to prevent damage to the tire rim.<ref name="Erjavec-2005">{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U4TBoJB2zgsC&q=%22run-flat+tire%22&pg=RA8-PP26 |title=Automotive Technology: A Systems Approach|last=Erjavec|first=Jack|date=2005|publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=9781401848316 |pages=1100 |language=en}}</ref> Vehicles without run-flat tires rely on a spare tire, which may be a compact tire, to replace a damaged tire.<ref name="Erjavec-2005" />
* Race car tires come in three main categories, ''DOT'' (street-legal), ''slick'', and ''rain''. Race car tires are designed to maximize cornering and acceleration friction at the expense of longevity. Racing slicks have no tread to maximize contact with the pavement and rain tires have channels to eject water to avoid [[Aquaplaning|hydroplaning]].<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=9EV9-xiiJzcC&q=%22Wheel+and+Tire+Performance+Handbook%22 |title=Wheel and Tire Performance Handbook |last=Newton |first=Richard |publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=9781610592512|pages=52|language=en}}</ref>

==== Heavy duty ====
[[File:Gianttires ontruck.jpg|thumb|Off-road tires under transport]]

Heavy-duty tires for large trucks and buses come in a variety of profiles and carry loads in the range of {{Convert|1800|to|2500|kg|lb}} on the drive wheel.<ref name="Duffy-2015" /> These are typically mounted in tandem on the drive axle.<ref name="Erjavec-2005" />

* Truck tires come in a variety of profiles that include "low profile" with a section height that is 70 to 45% of the tread width, "wide-base" for heavy vehicles, and a "super-single" tire that has the same total contact pressure as a dual-mounted tire combination.<ref name="Erjavec-2005" />
* Off-road tires are used on construction vehicles, agricultural and forestry equipment, and other applications that take place on soft terrain. The category also includes machinery that travels over hardened surfaces at industrial sites, ports, and airports.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XXYYI-vFyrwC&q=%22Off-the-Road%22+tires|title=Certain Off-the-Road Tires from China|last=Haines|first=Elizabeth|publisher=U.S. International Trade Commission|isbn=9781457817304|edition=701-TA-448 and 731-TA-1117|pages=4|language=en}}</ref> Tires designed for soft terrain have a deep, wide tread to provide traction in loose dirt, mud, sand, or gravel.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://industrialjournalism.com/2019/05/08/global-off-the-road-tire-market-development-history-current-analysis-and-estimated-forecast-to-2025/ |title=Global Off The Road Tire Market: Development History, Current Analysis and Estimated Forecast to 2025 |date=May 8, 2019 |work=Industrial Journalism |access-date=2019-05-09 |archive-date=22 August 2025 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20250822022025/https://industrialjournalism.com/2019/05/08/global-off-the-road-tire-market-development-history-current-analysis-and-estimated-forecast-to-2025/ |url-status=dead }}</ref> Edit summary (Briefly describe your changes) By publishing changes, you agree to the Terms of Use , and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and the GFDL .
