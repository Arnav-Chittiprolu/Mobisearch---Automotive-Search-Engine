From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Type of keyed door lock This article needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( November 2023 ) A night latch (or night-latch or nightlatch ) is a lock that is fitted on the surface of a door; it is operated from the exterior side of the door by a key and from the interior (i.e. "secure") side of the door by a knob. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Overview [ edit ] Night latches are usually rim locks [ 4 ] and are available as deadlocking (automatically locks once shut) and non-deadlocking versions. Historically, such locks were intended for use at night-time, hence the name. [ 5 ] The keyless egress that they offer is a valuable fire safety measure, but may be a security risk if breaking a glass panel (usually in the door) or a nearby small window allows an intruder to reach the knob inside and open the door from the outside.
