The F48 X1 was unveiled at the September 2015 Frankfurt Motor Show , [ 6 ] and later at the 2015 Tokyo Motor Show . [ 7 ] Contrary to the previous generation which uses rear-wheel drive as standard, all models are now front-wheel drive based (marketed as sDrive ) while also available with an optional all-wheel drive ( xDrive ). [ 8 ] Development and launch [ edit ] The F48 X1 is based on the modular front-wheel-drive-based UKL2 platform that is shared between BMW and MINI models, [ 9 ] instead of being based on the rear-wheel drive 3 Series Touring platform as with the previous generation X1 . [ 10 ] In comparison, the F48 X1 has a 90 mm (3.5 in) shorter wheelbase, and is 23 mm (0.9 in) wider, and 67 mm (2.6 in) taller compared to its predecessor. However, the new platform has allowed for increased interior legroom, headroom, and shoulder room. [ 11 ] A long-wheelbase model for the Chinese market (F49 model code) was unveiled at the 2016 Beijing Auto Show , and features a 110 mm (4.3 in) longer wheelbase. [ 12 ] Long-wheelbase models share the same engines and also introduced a new all-wheel drive hybrid model called the xDrive25Le. [ 13 ] These models went on sale in May 2016. [ 14 ] The xDrive25i is marketed as the xDrive28i in North American markets. [ 15 ] 2018 BMW X1 sDrive18i xLine 2016 BMW X1 xDrive25i M Sport 2016 BMW X1 xDrive25i M Sport Interior LCI [ edit ] In May 2019, the facelifted LCI model was revealed on the official BMW website. Changes include new available LED headlights, bumpers (with LED taillights), new wheels, and a larger kidney grille reminiscent to other contemporary BMW models such as the F40 1 Series . [ 16 ] The BMW X1 xDrive25e plug-in hybrid version was revealed in September 2019. [ 17 ] 2020 BMW X1 sDrive18i 2020 BMW X1 sDrive18i 2020 BMW X1 xDrive25e M Sport 2020 BMW X1 xDrive25e M Sport Equipment [ edit ] All models get 17-inch alloy wheels, a roof rack, an electrically operated tailgate, a 6.5-inch iDrive system , cloth seats, and 40:20:40 split-folding rear seats. [ 18 ] The X1 is also offered in a Sport trim which adds sports seats, and in xLine and M Sport trim which adds heated leather seats. [ 19 ] Available options include a panoramic sunroof, an upgraded iDrive Navigation Plus system with an 8.8-inch touch display, and a head-up display . [ 20 ] sDrive16d and 18i models are available with a 6-speed manual transmission and sDrive18i models can be upgraded to a 6-speed Automatic Transmission for 2016 to 2017 and a 7-speed Steptronic dual clutch transmission (DCT) from 2018 onwards. The rest of the model range receives the 8-speed Steptronic automatic manufactured by Aisin ( AWF8F35 ) as standard from 2016 to 2017, and sDrive20i models receive a Steptronic 7-speed DCT (similar to the 2018-up sDrive18i) from 2018 onwards, while the rest of the range still gets the same 8-speed Steptronic automatic. From 2018 onwards, all F48 X1s are equipped with the newer iDrive 6 infotainment operating system, replacing the iDrive 4 system found in the earlier cars. This also introduced a touchscreen display for cars equipped with navigation (for both 6UN Navigation Business 6.5” and 6UP Navigation Plus 8.8”), and those without navigation continued to be fitted with the older non-touchscreen 6.5” display found in the 2016-2017 X1s with either no navigation or 6UN Navigation Business. Visually the 6.5” displays can be identified with the screen bezels, a matte grey bezel that is raised around the screen indicates it is a non-touchscreen display, while the touchscreen displays have a smooth glossy black glass panel that is continuous with the screen. 8.8” displays are identically visually, however all iDrive 4 equipped cars with an 8.8” display have the non-touchscreen variant and all iDrive 6 equipped cars with an 8.8” display have the touchscreen variant. In September 2019, BMW revealed the X1 xDrive25e plug-in hybrid model, which combines a 1.5-litre 3-cylinder petrol engine with a 9.7 kWh lithium-ion battery pack and a 94 hp (70 kW; 95 PS) electric motor. [ 21 ] The system output is 220 hp (164 kW; 223 PS) and 385 N⋅m (284 lb⋅ft) of torque. The petrol engine is paired with a 6-speed Steptronic automatic transmission. The pure electric range as per NEDC is 57 kilometres (35 mi).
