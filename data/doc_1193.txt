The plant is built in a 77.6 ha (192 acres) land in Cikarang and has been operated since the second half of 2021 with the annual capacity of 150,000.

It is also characterized by the application of various eco-friendly methods. Some of the plant's electricity is produced with solar power generation facilities, and volatile organic compounds were minimized by the water-soluble painting method. Furthermore, air pollution reduction facilities were used to reduce air pollution and heat loss was minimized by applying far-infrared ovens to the painting process.
