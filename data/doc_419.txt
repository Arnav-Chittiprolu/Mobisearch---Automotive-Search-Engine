[ 9 ] It has a five-door liftback design and is marketed in the E-segment . [ 3 ] An estate model marketed as the Tourer or Shooting Brake was officially unveiled on 20 February 2024. [ 10 ] Concept cars [ edit ] Volkswagen ID. Space Vizzion [ edit ] A wagon variant is in development, as confirmed by pre-production prototypes , [ 11 ] serving as the production version of the ID. Space Vizzion concept. [ 12 ] Volkswagen ID. Aero [ edit ] The model was first previewed by the Volkswagen ID. Aero concept car in June 2022. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Volkswagen ID.Next [ edit ] Unveiled in April 2023, the Volkswagen ID.Next previews the ID.7's sister model for the Chinese market, which will be manufactured by SAIC-Volkswagen , while the ID.7 Vizzion will be produced by FAW-Volkswagen . [ 15 ] Volkswagen ID.Next Rear view Overview [ edit ] A camouflaged near-production version was previewed on 4 January 2023, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] The world premiere of the ID.7 took place on 17 April 2023, simultaneously in Berlin and at the Shanghai Auto Show . [ 18 ] The vehicle replaces both the Passat and the Arteon mid-size sedans as the flagship vehicle for the brand. The ID.7 rides on the newly established MEB , where it is based on other battery electric vehicles such as the Volkswagen ID.4 and the Audi Q4 e-tron . It is compared to D-segment vehicles such as the BMW i4 and the Tesla Model S . [ 19 ] VW calls it its most aerodynamic ID series model so far with a C d A=0.23*2.46 m 2 ≈0.57 m 2 . The ID.7 is produced in Emden , Germany for Europe, whereas it is built in Foshan and Anting for China. [ 20 ] Primarily because the ID.7 is larger and uses a standard rear-wheel drive layout, unlike the previous Arteon and Passat which both had a standard front-wheel drive layout, the ID.7 is positioned upmarket and competes with similar vehicles. [ 21 ] On 19 February 2024, Volkswagen introduced the ID.7 Tourer, an estate version of the ID.7 which measures the same in length compared to the liftback ID.7. [ 22 ] After previously having been confirmed for the North American market, its launch in the United States was delayed and later canceled. [ 23 ] Rear view Volkswagen ID.7 GTX Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer Rear view Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer GTX Rear view Interior Features [ edit ] The dashboard features a compact digital instrument display as well as a head-up display with augmented reality functions for satellite navigation and a 380 mm (15 in) infotainment touchscreen in the centre. [ 24 ] It is equipped with better software and improved touch controls after Volkswagen received complaints about the system used in its other models. [ 25 ] Volkswagen's voice control system has been significantly improved, allowing users to perform complex tasks such as searching for high-speed charging stations using voice commands. [ 26 ] Exterior features include an optional panoramic sunroof with smart electric-chroming to dim, and it can be switched from transparent to opaque that can be operated by Volkswagen's voice commands. A 700-watt Harman Kardon audio system with 14 speakers is optional. Automatic parking is standard, which allows the vehicle to park autonomously from more than 16 m (54 ft). Travel Assist is to come on European models, but it is unknown for the US. [ 27 ] The front seats feature a brand new design and offer an optional Climatronic massage and temperature and moisture sensors, which automatically adjust to suit the driver and passenger's needs. The climate control system features active air vent control with smart air vents which ventilate through dynamic movement without blowing air directly into the passenger's face.
