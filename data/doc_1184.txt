[ 1 ] The first-generation Kona debuted in June 2017 and the production version was revealed later that year. It is positioned between the Venue or Bayon and the Tucson in Hyundai crossover SUV line-up. The battery electric version called the Kona Electric (or Kona EV) was first launched in South Korea during the first half of 2018 and rolled out gradually worldwide afterwards. [ 2 ] Naming [ edit ] The Kona is named after the western district of the island of Hawaiʻi . [ 3 ] The company stated the name "reflects the lifestyle of modern customers", in line with its "progressive design" that it adopts. [ 4 ] The Kona naming also continues Hyundai's tradition of naming crossover SUV models after famous travel destinations, including the Creta, Santa Fe, Tucson and Veracruz. [ 5 ] The vehicle is marketed in Portugal as the Hyundai Kauai , as Kona is too similar to cona , a slang word for the female genitalia in European Portuguese . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Like Kona, Kauai is a place in Hawaii . In China , the vehicle was sold as the Hyundai Encino . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The car is sold both in Iceland and Norway under its original name. In Icelandic the word kona means woman, while in Norwegian kona is the singular definite form of kone , meaning wife .

[ 20 ] Positioned below the Tucson , it was the smallest crossover SUV in the Hyundai global line-up until that position was taken by the Venue in 2019. [ 21 ] The first-generation Kona was built on a newly developed B-segment SUV platform derived from the Hyundai i30 platform [ 19 ] which was designed to accommodate a range of powertrains, including fuel cell and electric variants. [ 22 ] While it was developed as an urban-oriented crossover SUV, the first-generation Kona was available in front-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive variants; the rear suspension is a torsion beam for the former and a dual-arm multi-link configuration for the latter. [ 22 ] For the North American market, the Kona was launched at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November 2017 and was available at Hyundai dealers in the first quarter of 2018 for the 2018 model year. [ 23 ] Engine options offered are 2.0-litre 4-cylinder Atkinson cycle engine capable of 147 hp (149 PS; 110 kW) and 132 lb⋅ft (179 N⋅m; 18.2 kg⋅m), paired with a 6-speed automatic transmission. Higher trims are powered with a 1.6-litre Gamma turbo engine paired with a 7-speed dual-clutch transmission producing 175 hp (177 PS; 130 kW) and 195 lb⋅ft (264 N⋅m; 27.0 kg⋅m). [ 24 ] The Kona is either not sold or only sold in low volumes in markets where the simpler Creta is offered, such as Latin America, India, and Russia. Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam are the few countries that briefly sold the petrol-powered Kona before it was indirectly replaced by the Indonesian-built Creta in 2022. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] The Chinese market had both the Kona and Creta, named there the Encino and ix25 respectively. Rear (pre-facelift) Interior Kona Electric [ edit ] The Kona Electric is a battery electric version of the Kona. It is the second electric car from Hyundai after the Ioniq . Sales started in Korea and Europe in 2018, with a market debut in the United States in 2019. [ 27 ] [ 28 ] [ 2 ] Kona Electric was available in two battery capacities: 39.2 kWh and 64 kWh. [ 29 ] The 'ultimate' trim features adaptive cruise control and along with lane centering [ 30 ] [ 31 ] means the vehicle meets the SAE standard for Level 2 driverless . [ 32 ] The Kona EV has a range of 415 km (258 mi) with the 64 kWh battery. [ 33 ] [ 34 ] Real-world range tests conducted by What Car in early 2019 found that the Kona EV had the highest real-world range among electric cars for sale in the United Kingdom. [ 35 ] In 2020 Hyundai Europe conducted a three day test at Lausitzring track in Germany and achieved ranges of up to 1026km with the 64 kWh model, an efficiency of 100 Wh/mile (6.23Kwh/100Km) at an average speed of 30km/h (19mph) [ 36 ] In March 2019, Hyundai launched the Kona Electric in Thailand. In July 2019, Hyundai launched an Electric Lite version as Kona Electric in India. In 2020, Hyundai started producing the Kona Electric in its European factory in the Czech Republic, where there are plans for an annual production of 30,000 vehicles. [ 13 ] Kona Electric reached 100,000 global sales in June 2020. [ 37 ] Hyundai Encino EV was launched on the Chinese car market in November 2019. The electric motor of the Encino EV has an output of 150 kW; 204 PS (201 hp) and 310 N⋅m (31.6 kg⋅m; 229 lb⋅ft). The motor is powered by a 64.2 kWh battery with an NEDC range of 500 km (310 mi). [ 38 ] In November 2021, the facelifted Hyundai Kona Electric was launched in Malaysia. [ 39 ] With three variants, two battery packs are on offer - 39.2 kWh and 64 kWh - with battery ranges going from 303 km in the smaller pack and going up to 484 km in the larger pack. In 2021, the Hyundai Kona Electric was the sixth best-selling electric vehicle in the UK having achieved a total of 7,199 registrations throughout the year. [ 40 ] In June 2024, the Hyundai Kona Electric was discontinued in India, and it is replaced by the Creta Electric . [ 41 ] 2019 Hyundai Kona Electric 2019 Hyundai Kona Electric Powertrain Facelift [ edit ] In September 2020, Hyundai unveiled a facelift version of the Kona, for the original SUV as well as the Kona Electric and N Line models. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] The facelift primarily had exterior aesthetic changes, alongside extra cargo capacity and rear seat legroom. Also a 48 volt mild hybrid system was added to the 1.0L three cylinder [ 44 ] 2021 Kona (facelift) 2021 Kona Hybrid (facelift) 2021 Kona Electric (facelift) 2021 Kona Electric (facelift) 2021 Kona N Line (facelift) 2021 Kona N Line (facelift) Kona N [ edit ] Released at Hyundai N Day on 27 April 2021, the Kona N is Hyundai's first high-performance SUV under the Hyundai N division.

It is available with petrol, mild hybrid, hybrid and battery electric models, while diesel engine options are no longer offered. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] According to Hyundai, the second-generation Kona was first designed as a battery electric vehicle before being adapted for other variants. Compared to the previous generation, the vehicle has a significantly larger footprint with around 150 mm (5.9 in) additional length (depending on the variant) and a 60 mm (2.4 in) longer wheelbase. [ 64 ] As the result, the rear legroom is 31 mm (1.2 in) larger at 925 mm (36.4 in). With the second-row seat folded, the vehicle has 466 litres (16.5 cu ft) of boot space ( VDA standard) or 723 litres (25.5 cu ft) (SAE standard). The drag coefficient is rated 0.27.

The variant is distinguished with pixelated front and rear thin light bars and blocked front grille, while a Parametric Pixel design feature has been applied to the front and bottom of the rear bumper. [ 65 ] The Kona Electric is built with a 400 V electrical architecture, which impairs its DC fast charging times comparing to other Hyundai EVs built on the more recent 800 V architecture. Hyundai claims a 10-80% state of charge can be accomplished in 41 minutes, against the 18 minutes it claims for some of their 800V models. [ 66 ] It also includes vehicle-to-load (V2L) support, with different maximum outputs depending on the market. Two battery capacities are offered, which are 48.4 kWh (Standard Range) and 65.4 kWh (Long Range) powering a front-mounted electric motor.

The issue relates to a manufacturing defect, the bracket that retains the Engine Control Unit (ECU) could interfere with the vehicle wiring in the event of a collision, causing a short circuit results in a vehicle fire. Kona models that were built from the 2023 model year were affected by the recall. [ 108 ] Awards [ edit ] At the 2019 North American International Auto Show in Detroit , both the electric and non-electric versions were announced as the winners of the 2019 North American Utility Vehicle of the Year , the first for a subcompact crossover SUV in its award history. [ 109 ] U.S. News & World Report ranked the Hyundai Kona at No. 1 (tied with the Kia Soul and Mazda CX-30 ) on its list of Best Subcompact SUVs for 2022, giving it a score of 8.4 out of 10. [ 110 ] In 2023, Hyundai Kona won the 'Car of the Year' prize at the Auto Express New Car Awards.
