Based on the MEB platform , the ID.4 is the second model of the Volkswagen ID. series . The production version of the ID.4 debuted in September 2020 as the first fully-electric crossover SUV under the Volkswagen brand, [ 9 ] while the coupe-shaped variant of the ID.4 (akin to the Audi Q8 Sportback e-tron ) is marketed as the Volkswagen ID.5 and was presented in November 2021. [ 10 ] The ID.4 is positioned by Volkswagen as a high-volume, mass-market electric vehicle — a car for "the millions, not the millionaires," as the company claimed in its advertising. [ 11 ] It was delivered to European customers from late 2020, and the first quarter of 2021 for the North American market. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The ID.4 was elected World Car of the Year 2021 over runner-ups Honda e and Toyota Yaris . [ 14 ] The vehicle was updated for model year 2024 to include a more powerful and efficient APP 550 electric motor with increased range, as well as heavily revised software and infotainment hardware. [ 15 ] Overview [ edit ] The ID.4 was previewed by the I.D. Crozz and I.D. Crozz II concept cars, which debuted in 2017 at the Shanghai and Frankfurt Auto Show , respectively. [ 16 ] A prototype version of the ID.4 appeared in camouflage at the 2019 Frankfurt Motor Show discreetly so as not to steal the show from the first electric mass-market vehicle of the German brand, the ID.3 . [ 17 ] The production version was presented globally on 23 September 2020. Unlike the ID.3 which is oriented mainly for the European market, the ID.4 also targeted the North American region as one of its core markets. Volkswagen Group of America CEO Scott Keogh went as far as saying the ID.4 "drives like a GTI , it has the packaging of a Tiguan and the purpose of the Beetle ," to emphasize its driving dynamics, design, and technology. [ 18 ] At launch, the electric SUV was solely offered with rear-wheel-drive and an electric motor located at the rear axle, with the dual motor all-wheel-drive version to follow later. First sales were for the ID.4 "1st edition", which differs in some interior and exterior features from the series production models. [ 19 ] Headlights and taillights are mostly LED lamps on the ID.4, with Matrix LED lights being an optional feature in some regions. The front features a low-positioned air inlet behind which the radiator and parts of the air conditioning system are located. Short overhangs and a wheelbase of 2,766 mm (108.9 in) add up to a length of 4,584 mm (180.5 in). Wheels are offered in 18–21 inch sizes. RWD models can tow a maximum of 1,000 kg (2,200 lb) on a braked trailer with an optional tow bar and feature roof rails as standard. [ 20 ] With a 5.3 inch driver display and a 10-inch infotainment screen as well as Apple Carplay and Android Auto as standard equipment equipment, the ID.4 features an optional augmented reality head-up display (HUD) as well as an optional 12" infotainment screen. The design includes a light strip below the windscreen providing visual cues related to certain functions such as the state of charge (SOC) when charging or brake alerts, which VW calls "ID. Light".  Safety features include VW's Car2X communication system. An optional heat pump extending range under low temperature conditions is offered or fitted as standard equipment in certain markets such as Canada [ 21 ] and uses a R744 (CO 2 ) refrigerant. [ 22 ] VW claims the heat pump can warm the cabin 2-3 times more efficiently than a resistance heater . The boot offers 543 L of volume and 1,575 L when the rear seats are folded. The vehicle does not offer a storage compartment at the front end ("frunk"). The ID. 4 were to be launched in Australasia along with the ID.3 , ID.5 and ID. Buzz in Mid-2024. [ 23 ] The launches of the ID.4 and ID.5 in Australia were delayed past the original date. [ 24 ] For the 2024 model year, the ID.4/5 receives an update including a larger 12.9 inch infotainment display with new software, 82 kWh models also get an upgraded APP 550 motor, providing improved power and efficiency at the same time. [ 25 ] Rear view Interior Volkswagen ID.5 [ edit ] The Volkswagen ID.5 was previewed in August 2021, revealed in November 2021, and produced since January 2022. [ 10 ] [ 26 ] It features a lower 0.26 drag coefficient, which is 0.02 lower than the ID.4. The model is available in three variants, which are Pro, Pro Performance and GTX, with the latter using a dual motor all-wheel-drive layout. Three powertrain options are available, although unlike the ID.4, the ID.5 comes with just one battery capacity, which is 77 kWh. The ID.5's sloping roofline decreases the cargo space, which offers 549 L with the rear seats up and 1,561 L with the seats folded. [ 27 ] Volkswagen ID.5 Rear view Volkswagen ID.5 GTX Rear view Volkswagen ID.5 Prototype Rear view Specifications [ edit ] This section needs to be updated . The reason given is: Specs table still needs to be updated: a new column should be added for the European ID.4 Pro 4MOTION, which is AWD like the GTX, but has different power output than the GTX.. Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information. ( March 2024 ) Powertrain [ edit ] Since model year 2024, the ID.4 is fitted with the APP 550 electric drive, which is an oil-cooled brushless permanently excited synchronous machine positioned at the rear axle. The motor produces up to 210 kW (286 PS; 282 hp) of power and up to 550 N⋅m (410 lb⋅ft) of torque, [ 28 ] revolving at speeds of up to 16,000 rpm . [ 20 ] All-wheel drive variants have an additional motor on the front axle. The ID.4 recuperates energy when braking using the service brake pedal, with a deceleration of up to 0.25 g . When driving with the gear selector set to “D” mode, if the driver lifts their foot off the accelerator pedal , the vehicle is set to coast along in order to preserve energy, with the motor freely rotating. However the vehicle can also be set to “B” mode where it will recuperate instead, again with forces of up to 0.25 g. When stronger deceleration is required, the vehicle uses electrically boosted conventional hydraulic brakes via disc brakes at the front and sealed drum brakes at the rear. Battery [ edit ] The battery consists of a lithium-Ion battery pack which houses 9 battery modules in 10 compartments (Pure models) or 12 modules (Pro models) with each module containing the individual battery cells (24 per module) in a rectangular aluminium casing which sits in the vehicle's underbody. While the smaller battery holds an energy content of 55 kWh, of which 52 kWh are made available to the user, the larger pack comes in at 82/77 kWh. A model with a 62 kWh gross, 58 kWh net battery pack was released for the North American market in 2022. 82 kWh batteries supplied by LG Energy Solution originally had a peak DC fast charging rate of 125 kW, but was increased to 135 kW in an over-the-air update . The battery's thermal management system is designed to maintain the battery's temperature around the ideal range of 25 °C (77 °F) and utilises liquid cooling.

The versions with 146 hp (148 PS; 109 kW) or 168 hp (170 PS; 125 kW) are powered by a 52 kWh (usable) 55 kWh (gross) battery pack, while the larger 77 kWh (usable) 82 kWh (gross) battery can be paired with either a 172 hp (174 PS; 128 kW) or a 201 hp (204 PS; 150 kW) motor in early years, while in later years an improved motor with 286 hp (290 PS; 213 kW) replaced the latter. The 77 kWh model has an WLTP range of "up to" 351 mi (565 km) on a single charge. An AWD variant of the ID.4, marketed as the ID.4 GTX in Europe, [ 31 ] accelerates 0–96 km/h (0–60 mph) in 4.9 seconds and 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 5.4 seconds. Later models of the GTX have a 79 kWh (usable), 85 kWh (gross) battery pack exclusive to the GTX model. The ID.4 is produced at the Volkswagen Zwickau-Mosel Plant in Germany since start of production and is also built at the company's Emden plant since May 2022. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Volkswagen ID.4 GTX Volkswagen ID.4 GTX Interior North America [ edit ] For the North American market, the available battery packs are either 62 kWh or 82 kWh (gross capacity) that are positioned in the underbody. The 82 kWh battery pack offers a range of 245–291 mi (394–468 km) on a full charge on the EPA cycle, depending on version. [ 36 ] The 62 kWh battery pack is rated at 209 miles (336 km) by the EPA. [ 37 ] There have been two primary motors offered in the North American market. 82 kWh models made from 2021-2023 have the APP 310 offering 201 horsepower (150 kW) or 295 horsepower (220 kW) with a front auxiliary motor equipped in AWD models, while 82kWh models made from 2024 onwards use VW's new APP 550 motor, offering improved efficiency while simultaneously offering more power, at 282 horsepower (210 kW) or 335 horsepower (250 kW). 62kWh models all use a rear mounted APP 310 and does not offer AWD. 2021-2022 models were imported to North America and built in the Volkswagen Zwickau-Mosel Plant or Emden plant since model year 2022. [ 35 ] In August 2022, Volkswagen announced production location changes and added features for 2023 model year ID.4s: as of the 2023 model, Volkswagen ID.4 units sold in North America would be made in Volkswagen's Chattanooga Tennessee Assembly Plant .
Chattanooga began producing the ID.4 on July 26, 2022. [ 38 ] The North American ID.4 got a moderate refresh for model year 2023. It introduced a new 62 kWh battery pack that is now on the new Standard and S trim levels. The 62 kWh (gross) battery pack is provided exclusively by SK On and has a peak charging rate of 140 kW. The larger 82 kWh (gross) battery pack got updated. For exclusively the 2023 model year, batteries are split between two suppliers to increase production output: SK On and LG Energy Solution. On 82 kWh RWD models, some vehicles get the SK On battery pack providing a 170 kW peak charging speed, while other vehicles get the LG Energy Solutions battery pack with a 135 kW peak charging speed as used in most pre-2023 model year vehicles. All 82 kWh AWD models get the SK On battery. Volkswagen quotes a 10-80% DC fast charging time of 30 minutes for the SK On battery pack and 36 minutes for the LG battery pack. The battery capacity and EPA rated range are identical between the two battery packs. [ 39 ] After the 2023 model year, all batteries are supplied by SK On. 2024 and above 82 kWh models have improved the charging peak up to 175 kW and the 10-80% charging speed down from 30 minutes to 28 minutes. The 2023 refresh also includes specific changes to North American models, such as a redesigned center console, a larger 12-inch Discover Pro Max infotainment system, Park Assist Plus (autonomous parking system), assisted lane changing to the semi-autonomous highway assist system branded Volkswagen Travel Assist and 45-watt USB-C fast device charging standard across all trims. As well as new options like Area View (surround view camera system) , three-zone automatic climate control, heated rear seats, and new paint colors. [ 40 ] For the 2025 model year, the 62 kWh model was renamed from ID.4 Standard to ID.4 Limited, it was pulled off Volkswagen configuration websites and was sent to dealers as an off-menu option, for the 2026 model year, it appears the 62 kWh model has been quietly discontinued entirely, although there hasn't been a specific announcement from Volkswagen. China [ edit ] The Volkswagen ID.4 is available as two variants in China called the ID.4 X and the ID.4 Crozz. The two variants feature slightly different styling and are produced by SAIC-Volkswagen and FAW-Volkswagen respectively. [ 41 ] The ID.4 Crozz is similar to the European ID.4 and is offered with a smaller battery and a range of 400 km (249 mi) and 125 kW (168 hp; 170 PS) of power as well as a longer-ranged version offering 550 km (342 mi) of range according to the NEDC test and 150 kW (201 hp; 204 PS) of power. A high performance version with dual motor all-wheel drive and 225 kW (302 hp; 306 PS) as well as 520 km (323 mi) of range is to be released as well. [ 42 ] For the SAIC-Volkswagen ID.4 X, the car gains 20 mm (0.8 in) in length, mainly through the addition of a different bumper.

[ 44 ] In the Australian market, the ID.4 competes with the facelifted Tesla Model Y [ 45 ] and with the BYD Sealion 7 . Only the larger, 82-kWh battery is offered in Australia. Both rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive variants are available. The ID.5 coupe SUV was also launched in Australia alongside the ID.4.
