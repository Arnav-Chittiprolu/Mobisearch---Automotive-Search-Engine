[ 2 ] A person dealing in trade of bunker (fuel) is called a bunker trader. The term bunkering originated in the days of steamships , when coal was stored in bunkers. [ 1 ] Nowadays, the term bunker is generally applied to the petroleum products stored in tanks , and bunkering to the practice and business of refueling ships. Bunkering operations take place at seaports and include the storage and provision of the bunker (ship fuels) to vessels. [ 3 ] The Port of Singapore is currently the largest bunkering port in the world. [ 4 ] In 2023, Singapore recorded bunker fuel [ 5 ] sales volume totaling 51,824,000 tonnes, setting a new industry standard. The Island of Malta is known to host bunkering, in six locations including Hurd's bank . In 2015 the Malta-Sicily Channel was noted as "one of the most important oil transit routes in the world," and in 2011, around eight vessels per day bunkered in Maltese waters. [ 6 ] Two types of bunkering [ edit ] The two most common types of bunkering procedure at sea are "ship to ship bunkering" (STSB), in which one ship acts as a terminal, while the other moors. The second type is "stern line bunkering" (SLB), which is the easiest method of transferring oil but can be risky during bad weather. [ 7 ] Bunkering in maritime law [ edit ] Main article: Admiralty law In many maritime contracts, such as charter parties , contracts for carriage of goods by sea , [ 8 ] and marine insurance policies , [ 9 ] the ship-owner or ship operator is required to ensure that the ship is seaworthy . Seaworthiness requires not only that the ship be sound and properly crewed, but also that it be fully fuelled (or "bunkered") at the start of the voyage. [ 10 ] If the ship operator wishes to bunker en route, this must be provided for in a written agreement, or the interruption of the voyage may be deemed to be deviation (a serious breach of contract ). If the vessel runs out of fuel in mid-ocean, this also constitutes serious breach, allowing the insurer to cancel a policy [ 11 ] [ 12 ] and allowing a consignee to make a cargo claim. It may also lead to a salvage operation. The International Maritime Organisation is an agency of the United Nations responsible for the prevention of marine pollution by ships. On 1 January 2020, the agency began enforcing the IMO 2020 regulation of MARPOL Annex VI to minimise bunkering's environmental impact.
