It is the flagship model of the Genesis lineup. A four-door sedan , the G90 is the successor of the Hyundai Equus and was known as the Genesis EQ900 in South Korea from 2015 to 2019. The G90 is the first flagship sedan introduced by the Genesis brand. The first generation was released in December 2015, and it went on sale in North America, Russia, and the Middle East in the second half of 2016. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] It began development in 2012, and was developed over a period of four years, with approximately 1,200 dedicated researchers working on the design and mass production stages. In November 2018, the facelifted EQ900 went on sale in the Korean market, and from this model onwards, it was also sold in Korea under the name G90. The current model is the second generation released in 2021. [ 3 ] In order to reduce the thickness of the headlamps and the size of the low beam lamps, the micro lens array (MLA) technology was introduced to cross-arrange the low beams, daytime running lights, turn signals, and high beams. [ 4 ] The second generation is divided into a regular model and a Long Wheelbase (LWB) model, and the G90L has not currently been released.

[ 18 ] The rear combination lamp has a design that spans the entire rear, and the rear emblem has been replaced with an English letter "GENESIS" emblem. It is the first Genesis vehicle to be equipped with automatic wireless navigation updates and intelligent vehicle management services, which automatically connect the vehicle to the server and update only the necessary information. [ 19 ] Quietness has been improved through Active Noise Control that actively removes noise, and fuel efficiency has been improved by 2-3 % with a control device that automatically neutralizes the transmission when coasting without pressing the accelerator pedal.
