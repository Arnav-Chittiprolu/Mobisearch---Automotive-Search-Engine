From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Type of alert system on aircraft Boeing 777 EICAS Airbus A220 EICAS at the center Bombardier CRJ EICAS on the two central screens Embraer E-Jet EICAS Fairchild-Dornier 328JET EICAS on the central screen Saab 2000 EICAS on the two central screens An engine-indicating and crew-alerting system ( EICAS ) [ 1 ] is an integrated system used in modern aircraft to provide aircraft flight crew with instrumentation and crew annunciations for aircraft engines and other systems. On EICAS equipped aircraft the "recommended remedial action" is called a checklist. Components [ edit ] EICAS typically includes instrumentation of various engine parameters, including for example speed of rotation, temperature values including exhaust gas temperature , fuel flow and quantity, oil pressure etc. Other aircraft systems typically monitored by EICAS are for example hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, deicing, environmental and control surface systems. EICAS has high connectivity & provides data acquisition and routing. [ 2 ] Limitations [ edit ] On some Bombardier aircraft, it is possible to call up the wrong checklist. Messages forbidding take-off can be shown as advisories.
