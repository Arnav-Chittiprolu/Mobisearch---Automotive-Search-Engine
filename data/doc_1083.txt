Help From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Shortcuts CAT:CLEAN CAT:CLEAN CAT:CLEANUP CAT:CLEANUP This is a maintenance category , used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project . It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages , or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories (except for eponymous maintenance categories). This is a tracking category . It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme . This category is hidden on its member pages —unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. These categories can be used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse " (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list ( discriminated by classifications ). Here is a list of articles that need to be cleaned up. A list of these pages ordered by importance/popularity can be obtained using WMFLabs' MassViews tool here: MassViews Analysis (Takes a couple minutes to load due to the size of the list) Pick one and do your best.
