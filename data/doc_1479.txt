Do not fill this in! ==== Development for higher power charging ====
An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks was being developed as of 2020, which was slated to provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ([[Truck classification|Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well]], including school and transit buses). When the [[Combined Charging System|Charging Interface Initiative e. V.]] (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV),<ref name=HPCCV-2020-04>{{cite web |url= https://efiling.energy.ca.gov/GetDocument.aspx?tn=233844&DocumentContentId=66619 |title=CharIN HPCCV Task Force: High Power Plug Update [PDF] |date=April 2020 |publisher=CharIN |access-date=24 August 2021}}</ref> later renamed [[Megawatt Charging System]] (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200{{ndash}}1500{{nbsp}}V and 0{{ndash}}3000{{nbsp}}A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5{{nbsp}}megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://insideevs.com/news/372749/charin-hpccv-over-2-mw-power/ |title=CharIN Develops Super Powerful Charger With Over 2 MW Of Power |website=insideevs.com}}</ref> The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000{{nbsp}}V DC (optionally, 1500{{nbsp}}V DC) and 3000{{nbsp}}A continuous rating.<ref>{{cite report |url= https://www.charinev.org/fileadmin/HPCCV/High_Power_Commercial_Vehicle_Charging_Requirements_v2.0.pdf |title=CharIN High Power Commercial Vehicle Charging Task Force Aggregated Requirements |date=18 February 2019 |publisher=CharIN |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190710213141/https://www.charinev.org/fileadmin/HPCCV/High_Power_Commercial_Vehicle_Charging_Requirements_v2.0.pdf |archive-date=10 July 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{update after|2025|8|7}}

A connector design was selected in May 2019<ref name=HPCCV-2020-04/> and tested at the US [[National Renewable Energy Laboratory]] (NREL) in September 2020. Thirteen manufacturers participated in the test, which checked the coupling and thermal performance of seven vehicle inlets and eleven charger connectors.<ref>{{cite press release |url= https://www.charin.global/news/the-charin-path-to-megawatt-charging-mcs-successful-connector-test-event-at-nrel/ |title=The CharIN path to Megawatt Charging (MCS): Successful connector test event at NREL. |date=13 October 2020 |publisher=CharIN |access-date=24 August 2021}}</ref> The final connector requirements and specification was adopted in December 2021 as MCS connector version 3.2.<ref name="Gehm-2021">{{cite news |last=Gehm |first=Ryan |date=27 May 2021 |title=Mega push for heavy-duty EV charging |work=Truck & Off-Highway Engineering |publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers |url= https://www.sae.org/news/2021/05/megawatt-charging-for-electric-trucks |access-date=24 August 2021}}</ref><ref name="Bohn-2022-04">{{cite web |last=Bohn |first=Theodore |date=12 April 2022 |title=SAE J3271 Megawatt Charging System standard; part of MW+ multiport electric vehicle charging for everything that 'rolls, flies or floats' |url= https://publicdownload.epri.com/PublicAttachmentDownload.svc/AttachmentId=78275 |access-date=8 June 2022 |publisher=EPRI Bus & Truck}}</ref>{{rp|3}}<!-- did this ever become a standard?  did any vendors adopt it?  what is the state of things in 2025? -->{{clarify|has this standard been adopted globally? what are European and Asian standards?|date=August 2025}}

With support from [[Portland General Electric]], on 21 April 2021 [[Daimler Trucks North America]] opened the "Electric Island", the first heavy-duty vehicle charging station, across the street from its headquarters in Portland, Oregon. The station is capable of charging eight vehicles simultaneously, and the charging bays are sized to accommodate [[tractor-trailers]]. In addition, the design is capable of accommodating >1{{nbsp}}MW chargers once they are available.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://daimler-trucksnorthamerica.com/PressDetail/daimler-trucks-north-america-portland-general-2021-04-21 |title=Daimler Trucks North America, Portland General Electric open first-of-its-kind heavy-duty electric truck charging site |date=21 April 2021 |publisher=Daimler Trucks North America |access-date=24 August 2021}}</ref>{{clarify|what EV charging standard was used?|date=August 2025}} A startup company, WattEV, announced plans in May 2021 to build a 40-stall truck stop/charging station in Bakersfield, California.
