Help From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This is a tracking category . It is used to build and maintain a list or lists of pages—primarily for the sake of the lists themselves and their use in article and category maintenance. It is not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme . More information: This category is hidden on its member pages —unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. These categories are used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse " (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or subcategories into a larger, more efficient list ( discriminated by classifications ). Typically, tracking categories are automatically populated by templates invoked in pages or by the MediaWiki software (see Special:TrackingCategories for an overview of the latter). Administrators: Please do not delete this category as empty! This category may be empty occasionally or even most of the time. This category is not shown on its member pages unless the appropriate user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. This is a tracking category for disambiguation pages. It enables us to use {{PAGESINCATEGORY:All article disambiguation pages}} to get the exact number of disambiguation pages in the main namespace. Pages are put in this category by templates such as {{ Disambiguation }} and {{ Airport disambiguation }} . That is, templates built with the {{ dmbox }} meta-template, which is doing the actual categorising. This category only lists pages in main (article) space. See also [ edit ] Category:All disambiguation pages – Lists disambig pages in all namespaces. Category:All set index articles – The corresponding category for set index articles.
