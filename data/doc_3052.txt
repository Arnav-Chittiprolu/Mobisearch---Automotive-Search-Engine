In 1832 he built an early form of alternating current electrical generator, based on the principle of electromagnetic induction discovered by Michael Faraday . [ 1 ] Pixii's device was a spinning magnet, operated by a hand crank, where the north and south poles passed over a coil with an iron core, and thus classified as a magneto . A current pulse was produced each time a pole passed over the coil. He also found that the current direction changed when the north pole passed over the coil after the south pole. Later, acting on a suggestion by André-Marie Ampère , other results were obtained by introducing a commutator which produced a pulsating direct current . At that time direct current was preferable to alternating current. Although Pixii did not fully understand electromagnetic induction, his device led to more sophisticated devices being constructed.
A reproduction of Pixii's electrical generator can be admired at the Ampère Museum , close to Lyon. See also [ edit ] Alternating current References [ edit ] ^ Mohamed A.
