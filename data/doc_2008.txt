[ 7 ] [ 8 ] It is based on the Ford Ranger (T6) . While the BT-50 version was designed by a Mazda team based at Ford Australia's design center in Melbourne, both Ford and Mazda worked independently. Of the exterior panels, only the windscreen, roof, and rear screen are common between the Ranger and BT-50, although the underpinnings are largely the same. [ 9 ] Mazda BT-50 XTR (pre-facelift) Interior Facelift [ edit ] A revised BT-50 for the 2016 model year debuted in July 2015 and launched into the Australian market in September 2015. The UR series facelift is mainly cosmetic without any changes in engine specifications, however, several equipment changes and slight price differences over the pre-facelift model are present. [ 10 ] Another facelift for the second-generation BT-50 was launched for the Australian market in 2018. Changes includes revised looks and Apple CarPlay and Android Auto support through an Alpine head unit. [ 11 ] Mazda BT-50 SDX (facelift) Mazda BT-50 4x4 (facelift) Pangolin Edition [ edit ] In November 2020, Mazda Philippines launched the BT-50 4x4 Pangolin Edition to raise awareness of the endangered pangolin . This variant featured a matte black grille, aluminum roof rack, roll bars, riveted fender flares, 17-inch Rota alloy wheels, and a white pangolin decal on each side.

[ 17 ] Unlike its predecessors, the BT-50 was developed from the third-generation Isuzu D-Max . The pickup is a result of a tie-up between Mazda and Isuzu which was announced on 11 July 2016, with Isuzu agreeing to supply pickup trucks to Mazda. [ 18 ] An Isuzu executive told Australian media CarsGuide that Mazda had no involvement in the development of the D-Max, and that Mazda will be handed a finished pick-up truck instead. [ 19 ] As the result, the TF BT-50 is built at Isuzu Motors plant in Samrong, Samut Prakan , Thailand . The vehicle features the Mazda's Kodo design language similar to its crossover line-up. While it still shares the base structure, body shell and the wing mirrors with the Isuzu D-Max , Mazda made most of the body panels unique. It is powered by the Isuzu-sourced 3.0-litre 4JJ3-TCX inline-four turbo-diesel engine, replacing the 3.2-litre MZ-CD inline-five Ford Duratorq turbodiesel engine. [ 20 ] For the first time, the third-generation BT-50 is available with adaptive cruise control which is aided by twin cameras in the windscreen rather than a radar sensor in the grille, as to make the installation of off-road accessories in the front of the vehicle possible. Autonomous emergency braking, blind zone warning, rear cross-traffic alert, lane-keeping assistance and centre airbags are also available in select trims. [ 21 ] Rear view Interior Markets [ edit ] Australia [ edit ] The third-generation BT-50 was released in Australia in October 2020, with three trim levels: XT, XTR and GT. In Australia, it is available in single cab, extended cab and double cab configurations. At launch, it was only available with a 3.0-litre turbo diesel engine. [ 22 ] The 1.9-litre turbo diesel engine option and entry-level XS trim was added in November 2021. [ 23 ] Malaysia [ edit ] The third-generation BT-50 was launched on 30 November 2021. It comes in four trims: 1.9 Single Cab 4x4 (manual only), 1.9 Mid 4x4 (manual and automatic), 1.9 High 4x4 (automatic only) and 3.0 High Plus 4x4 (automatic only). [ 24 ] The facelifted model was launched in Malaysia on 5 November 2025, in the sole 3.0D High Plus variant, powered by the 3.0-litre turbo diesel engine. [ 25 ] Philippines [ edit ] The third-generation BT-50 was released on 17 November 2021. It comes in two trims: 4x2 Standard (6-speed manual and automatic) and 4x4 Premium (automatic only). All variants are powered with the 3.0-litre 4JJ3-TCX engine. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] The facelifted model was launched in the Philippines on 23 April 2025, with two variants: 4x2 and 4x4 Pangolin.

[ 30 ] Facelift [ edit ] The BT-50 received a facelift on 18 October 2024. The changes includes an updated front fascia with new headlights and new grille similar to the Mazda CX-5 , new tailamps, larger Mazda logo on the front fascia and the tailgate, a tweaked front and rear bumpers, an integrated air curtain for the front bumper for improved aerodynamics, new taillights, new exterior colours.
