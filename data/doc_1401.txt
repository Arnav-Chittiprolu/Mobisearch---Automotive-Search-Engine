From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Electric autonomous vehicle with cabin on two wheels Motor vehicle GM EN-V 2012 GM EN-V Overview Manufacturer GM Production 2011-2014 Body and chassis Body style hatchback General Motors EN-V (Electric Networked-Vehicle) is a 2-seat urban electric concept car jointly developed by Segway Inc. and General Motors that can be driven normally or operated autonomously. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Designed for urban environments and around an extrapolation of the P.U.M.A. prototype announced by GM and Segway in 2009, [ 3 ] the EN-V was unveiled at the joint GM & SAIC pavilion at the Expo 2010 in Shanghai from 1 May through 31 October 2010. [ 3 ] Three different vehicles are showcased, 笑 Xiao (Laugh), 骄 Jiao (Pride) and 妙 Miao (Magic). [ 4 ] In October 2011 General Motors announced  its decision to develop a second concept EN-V under the Chevrolet badge for use in field testing and demonstration programs, beginning in Tianjin , China. [ 5 ] In June 2014 General Motors announced it would commence testing of the four wheel EN-V 2.0 at the Tianjin Eco-city [ 6 ] Driverless vehicle [ edit ] The most significant feature of the vehicles is autonomous operation. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The EN-V can detect and avoid obstacles – including other vehicles – park themselves and come to you when called by phone. [ 1 ] Accomplished through a combination of GPS , vehicle-based sensors, and vehicle-to-vehicle communication, this autonomous technology is an extrapolation of that found in GM's 2007 autonomous "The Boss" Chevrolet Tahoe created for the DARPA Grand Challenge (2007) . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The EN-Vs can communicate with each other allowing platooning, with one or more EN-Vs tagging along automatically behind a leader. Also, if an EN-V detects another in close proximity, it can check what that other is intending to do and agree on how to pass it safely. [ 1 ] Shanghai concept [ edit ] Specifications [ edit ] Powered by two electric motors, one on each wheel, and a lithium-ion phosphate battery, the EN-V has a top speed of 40 kilometres per hour (25 mph) and a maximum all-electric range of 40 kilometres (25 mi). [ 1 ] The sensors and communications equipment which allow it to drive itself include short-range radio and GPS , as well as optical sensors , ultrasonic sensors and doppler radars . [ 7 ] The two-wheeled balancing system the EN-V uses was developed by Segway , [ 1 ] [ 2 ] and it may be an extrapolation of that found in the P.U.M.A. prototype announced by GM and Segway in 2009. [ 3 ] The themes [ edit ] EN-V Laugh (Xiao, 笑) EN-V Magic (Miao, 妙) The three vehicles shown use the same automobile platform but have unique exterior and interior designs. Xiao (笑) [ edit ] Xiao , or laugh, was designed in Australia by the GM Holden Design Studio. [ 3 ] Its design is intended to appear friendly. [ 8 ] Xiao Dimensions: 1,540 mm (L) × 1,420 mm (W) × 1,770 mm (H) (60.5 in × 56 in × 69.5 in) [ 7 ] Miao (妙) [ edit ] Miao , or magic, was designed at the General Motors Advanced Design Studio in California . [ 3 ] Miao's design is mysterious and high-tech. [ 8 ] It was also exhibited at the Walt Disney World ride Test Track as a Chevrolet Miao Dimensions: 1,520 mm (L) × 1,405 mm (W) × 1,635 mm (H) (60 in × 55 in × 64.5 in) [ 7 ] Jiao (骄) [ edit ] Jiao , or pride, was designed in Europe by Opel and takes design cues from bullet trains and Chinese opera masks. [ 3 ] Its design is supposed to be chic and stylish. [ 8 ] Jiao Dimensions: 1,500 mm (L) × 1,425 mm (W) × 1,640 mm (H) (59 in × 56 in × 64.5 in) [ 7 ] Chevrolet EN-V 2.0 [ edit ] In October 2011 General Motors announced its decision to develop a second concept EN-V under the Chevrolet badge for use in field testing and demonstration programs in several cities around the world, beginning in Tianjin , China. The Chevrolet EN-V 2.0, as the vehicle is now called, will add new features such as climate control, personal storage space and all-weather and road condition operation while several key elements of the original EN-V will be preserved, such as the small footprint, maneuverability, its battery electric propulsion, connectivity, and autonomous driving capabilities. [ 5 ] The new vehicle design as revealed in 2014 has four wheels and has two doors (one of each side). [ 9 ] Testing at the Tianjin Eco-city was due to commence in July 2014. In popular culture [ edit ] The Chevy EN-V is featured in the Walt Disney Pictures film Tomorrowland . [ 10 ] The EN-V is featured as part of the queue for the Epcot pavilion Test Track at Walt Disney World , which is sponsored by Chevrolet .
