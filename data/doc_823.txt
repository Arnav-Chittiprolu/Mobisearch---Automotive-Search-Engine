Founded in 2018 as Chongqing Changan New Energy Automobile Technology, the company became an independent brand in 2023. History [ edit ] In April 2008, Changan Automobile and Chongqing Science and Technology Venture Capital Co., Ltd. jointly invested to establish Changan New Energy Automobile Co., Ltd. On December 8, 2017, Changan Automobile established its New Energy Division, consolidating the planning of new energy products, vehicle development, powertrain system development, procurement, and sales under a single division. [ 2 ] Between January 2020 and March 2022, Changan New Energy and the New Energy Division of Changan Automobile were consolidated to form Changan New Energy Automobile Technology. During this period, 12 investors participated in two separate funding rounds, temporarily reducing Changan Automobile’s ownership from 100% to 40.66%. [ 3 ] The company also announced its first model, the SL03 (codenamed C385), under the newly introduced Changan Shenlan ( Chinese : 长安深蓝 ; pinyin : Cháng'ān Shēnlán ) brand. At the end of 2022, Changan Automobile increased its ownership stake in Changan New Energy Automobile Technology from 40.66% to 51.00% by acquiring a 10.34% stake from two shareholders, regaining majority control of the company. In 2023, the English name of the Changan Shenlan brand was revealed as Deepal and Changan New Energy Automobile Technology was renamed Deepal Automobile Technology. The Deepal brand operates independently of the Changan Group. [ 4 ] In November 2023, Deepal introduced two models in Thailand, the L07 sedan and the S07 SUV. Both models are imported from China.
