From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Electric car racing season ‹ The template Motorsport season is being considered for merging . › 2023 Extreme E Championship Drivers' Champions: Johan Kristoffersson Mikaela Åhlin-Kottulinsky Teams' Champion: Rosberg X Racing Previous 2022 Next 2024 Johan Kristoffersson (left) and Mikaela Åhlin-Kottulinsky (right) won the championship driving for Rosberg X Racing . The 2023 Extreme E Championship was the third season of the Extreme E electric off-road racing series. Calendar [ edit ] On 16 November 2022, the provisional 2023 season calendar was announced. Saudi Arabia , Sardinia and Chile returned from the previous year, with the latter moving to December, while Scotland joined. A further race in America , to take place in either Brazil or the United States, was scheduled for September as a replacement for Uruguay . [ 1 ] This was later set to move to Argentina , but the plans fell through, with a second event in Sardinia eventually announced on 29 August 2023 to fill the slot. [ 2 ] Round Event Location Dates 1 Desert X-Prix Neom , Saudi Arabia 11 March 2023 2 12 March 2023 3 Hydro X-Prix Dumfries and Galloway , Scotland 13 May 2023 4 14 May 2023 5 Island X-Prix I Sardinia , Italy 8 July 2023 6 9 July 2023 7 Island X-Prix II 16 September 2023 8 17 September 2023 9 Copper X-Prix Antofagasta , Chile 2 December 2023 10 3 December 2023 The following event was cancelled: Event Location Original Dates Amazon X-Prix or TBC X-Prix Brazil , United States , or Argentina 16 September 2023 17 September 2023 Race format [ edit ] The weekend format was tweaked again prior to the start of season three. All events will now be double-headers, with one full round taking place on Saturday and another on Sunday. Qualifying was also updated, with time trials dropped in favour of five-car races: each of the two qualifying sessions will consist of two heats. With the aim of condensing the schedule into a single day, the race format that included a pair of semi-finals, a "crazy race" and a final was discontinued. It is now the combined qualifying results that determine what team advances where, with the top five qualifiers progressing to the grand final and the bottom five to the new "redemption race". This means that qualifying now limits how many championship points an entrant can score: a team qualifying in positions one to five can be classified fifth at worst, while a team qualifying sixth or lower can only aspire to sixth at best. The points system remained largely unchanged—the only variations being a reduction from 5 to 2 points for the fastest Super Sector, and the introduction of 1 point for the winner of a qualifying heat. [ 3 ] Teams and drivers [ edit ] All teams that competed in the 2022 championship remained in 2023, with the exception of Xite Energy Racing which was taken over by English DJ Carl Cox . All teams use one of the identical Odyssey 21 electric SUVs manufactured by Spark Racing Technology , with ABT Cupra XE and Chip Ganassi Racing running modified bodyworks. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Each team consists of a male and a female driver, who share a car and have equal driving duties.
