* In November 2022, Tesla recalled all vehicles for an over-the-air software update to remedy a condition where the tail lamps on one or both sides of the vehicle could work intermittently, making the vehicle less visible to others and increasing the risk of a crash.<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 25, 2022 |title=Transport Canada Recall - 2022651 - TESLA |url=https://recalls-rappels.canada.ca/en/alert-recall/transport-canada-recall-2022651-tesla |access-date=March 26, 2023 |publisher=Transport Canada}}</ref>
* In February 2023, Tesla recalled all vehicles equipped with the Full Self Driving Beta in the US and Canada for an over-the-air software update at the direction of the [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA). The agency said the system had allowed the vehicle to "exceed speed limits or travel through intersections in an unlawful or unpredictable manner [which] increases the risk of a crash." Tesla opposed the federal request but ultimately complied. Elon Musk tweeted that the decision was, "anachronistic and just flat wrong!" U.S. senators Ed Markey and Richard Blumenthal said the recall was, "long overdue," adding, "Tesla must finally stop overstating the real capabilities of its vehicles." The fix, coming to a complete stop at stop signs rather than ~1&nbsp;mph, was provided via an over-the-air software update.<ref>{{Cite news |date=February 16, 2023 |title=Tesla recalls 362000 US Vehicles |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/tesla-recalls-362000-us-vehicles-over-full-self-driving-software-2023-02-16/ |access-date=March 26, 2023}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=February 15, 2023 |title=Part 573 Safety Recall Report 23V-085|url=https://static.nhtsa.gov/odi/rcl/2023/RCLRPT-23V085-3451.PDF |access-date=January 27, 2024 |publisher=[[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]]}}</ref>
