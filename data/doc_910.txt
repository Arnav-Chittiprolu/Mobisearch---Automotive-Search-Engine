From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Plug-in electric car ) Type of vehicle For the more general category of electric drive for all type of vehicles, see electric vehicle . For the specific electric drive cars and SUVs, see electric car and plug-in hybrid . All-time top-selling plug-in cars (global sales since inception) Tesla Model Y electric car (2.49 million) Tesla Model 3 electric car (2.06 million) Wuling Hongguang Mini EV electric car (1.22 million) BYD Song DM plug-in hybrid car (>1.05 million) As of December 2023 [update] [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] A plug-in electric vehicle is any road vehicle that can utilize an external source of electricity (such as a wall socket that connects to the power grid ) via a detachable power cable to store electrical energy within its onboard rechargeable battery packs , which will in turn power an electric traction motor that propels the vehicle's drive wheels . It is a subset of electric vehicles and includes all-electric/battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] both of which are capable of sustained all-electric driving within a designated range due to the ability to fully charge their batteries before a journey. Plug-in electric vehicles have several benefits compared to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. All-electric vehicles have lower operating and maintenance costs, and produce little or no air pollution when under all-electric mode , thus (depending on the electricity source) reducing societal dependence on fossil fuels and significantly decreasing greenhouse gas emissions , but recharging takes longer time than refueling and is heavily reliant on sufficient charging infrastructures to remain operationally practical. Plug-in hybrid vehicles are a good in-between option that provides most of electric vehicles' benefits when they are operating in electric mode, though typically having shorter all-electric ranges , but have the auxiliary option of driving as a conventional hybrid vehicle when the battery is low, using its internal combustion engine (usually a gasoline engine ) to alleviate the range anxiety that accompanies current electric vehicles. Sales of the first series production plug-in electric vehicles began in December 2008 with the introduction of the plug-in hybrid BYD F3DM , and then with the all-electric Mitsubishi i-MiEV in July 2009, but global retail sales only gained traction after the introduction of the mass production all-electric Nissan Leaf and the plug-in hybrid Chevrolet Volt in December 2011. Cumulative global sales of highway-legal plug-in electric passenger cars and light utility vehicles achieved the 1 million unit mark in September 2015, [ 8 ] 5 million in December 2018. [ 9 ] and the 10 million unit milestone in 2020. [ 10 ] Despite the rapid growth experienced, however, the stock of plug-in electric vehicles represented just 1% of all passengers vehicles on the world's roads by the end of 2020, of which pure electrics constituted two thirds. [ 11 ] As of December 2023 [update] , the Tesla Model Y ranked as the world's top selling highway-capable plug-in electric car in history. [ 1 ] The Tesla Model 3 was the first electric car to achieve global sales of more than 1,000,000 units. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The BYD Song DM SUV series is the world's all-time best selling plug-in hybrid, with global sales over 1,050,000 units through December 2023. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] As of December 2021 [update] , China had the world's largest stock of highway legal plug-in electric passenger cars with 7.84 million units, representing 46% of the world's stock of plug-in cars. [ 18 ] Europe ranked next with about 5.6 million light-duty plug-in cars and vans at the end of 2021, accounting for around 32% of the global stock. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] The U.S. cumulative sales totaled about 2.32 million plug-in cars through December 2021. [ 22 ] As of July 2021 [update] , Germany is the leading European country with cumulative sales of 1 million plug-in vehicles on the road, [ 23 ] and also has led the continent plug-in sales since 2019. [ 20 ] [ 24 ] Norway has the highest market penetration per capita in the world, [ 25 ] and also achieved in 2021 the world's largest annual plug-in market share ever registered, 86.2% of new car sales. [ 26 ] Terminology [ edit ] Brammo Empulse electric motorcycle at a charging station Plug-in electric vehicle [ edit ] A plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle with rechargeable battery packs that can be charged from the electric grid , and the electricity stored on board drives or contributes to drive the wheels for propulsion. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Plug-in electric vehicles are also sometimes referred to as grid-enabled vehicles (GEV), [ 6 ] and the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) calls them electrically chargeable vehicles (ECV). [ 27 ] PEV is a subcategory of electric vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Even though conventional hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) have a battery that is continually recharged with power from the internal combustion engine and regenerative braking , they can not be recharged from an off-vehicle electric energy source, and therefore, they do not belong to the category of plug-in electric vehicles. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] "Plug-in electric drive vehicle" is the legal term used in U.S. federal legislation to designate the category of motor vehicles eligible for federal tax credits depending on battery size and their all-electric range. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] In some European countries, particularly in France, "electrically chargeable vehicle" is the formal term used to designate the vehicles eligible for these incentives. [ 30 ] While the term "plug-in electric vehicle" most often refers to automobiles or "plug-in cars", there are several other types of plug-in electric vehicle, including battery electric multiple units , electric motorcycles and scooters , neighborhood electric vehicles or microcars , city cars , vans , buses, electric trucks or lorries , and military vehicles. [ 31 ] New energy vehicles [ edit ] Main article: Alternative energy vehicle See also: Plug-in electric vehicles in China In China , the term new energy vehicles (NEVs) refers to automobile vehicles that are fully powered or predominantly powered by alternative energy other than fossil fuels , typically referring to electric motor -propelled vehicles such as battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs, mainly hydrogen fuel cell vehicles ). The Chinese Government began implementation of its NEV program in 2009 to foster the development and introduction of new energy vehicles, [ 32 ] aiming to reduce the country's reliance on petroleum imports and better achieve energy security by promoting more electrified transportation powered by domestically generated , sustainable energy supply (see Energy policy of China ). Battery electric vehicles [ edit ] Main article: Battery electric vehicle U.S. Army GEM e2 neighborhood electric vehicle A battery electric vehicle (BEV) uses chemical energy stored in rechargeable battery packs as its only source for propulsion. [ 6 ] [ 33 ] BEVs use electric motors and motor controllers instead of internal combustion engines (ICEs) for propulsion. [ 6 ] A plug-in hybrid operates as an all-electric vehicle or BEV when operating in charge-depleting mode, but it switches to charge-sustaining mode after the battery has reached its minimum state of charge (SOC) threshold, exhausting the vehicle's all-electric range (AER). [ 34 ] [ 35 ] BEVs are all-electric vehicles that use only electricity to power the motor, with no internal combustion engine. The energy stored in the rechargeable battery pack is used to power the electric motor, which propels the vehicle. BEVs have no tailpipe emissions and can be charged by plugging into a charging station or using a home charging system. They are known for their quiet operation, instant torque, and smooth ride, and are also more environmentally friendly than traditional gasoline-powered vehicles. However, the range of a BEV is limited by the size of its battery, so it may not be suitable for long-distance travel. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles [ edit ] Main article: Plug-in hybrid A plug-in hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV or PHV), also known as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid electric vehicle with rechargeable batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. [ 6 ] [ 36 ] A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional hybrid electric vehicle and an all-electric vehicle : it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] [ 38 ] PHEVs are a hybrid between a traditional gasoline-powered vehicle and an all-electric vehicle. They have both an internal combustion engine and an electric motor powered by a rechargeable battery pack. PHEVs operate as all-electric vehicles when the battery has a sufficient charge, and switch to gasoline power when the battery is depleted. This provides a longer driving range compared to a pure electric vehicle, as the gasoline engine acts as a range extender. PHEVs can be charged by plugging into a charging station or using a home charging system. They are a good option for those who want the benefits of electric driving, but also need the longer driving range and refueling convenience of a gasoline-powered vehicle. Several Prius+ converted plug-in hybrids Dual plug-in hybrids [ edit ] These contain two different energy recovery systems. The Mercedes-AMG ONE is a plug-in dual hybrid . The Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W206) and the Mercedes C254/X254 also have an electrically-assisted turbocharger / MGU-H . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Aftermarket conversions [ edit ] See also: Plug-in hybrid conversions and electric vehicle conversion An aftermarket electric vehicle conversion is the modification of a conventional internal combustion engine vehicle (ICEV) or hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) to electric propulsion, creating an all-electric or plug-in hybrid electric vehicle . [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] There are several companies in the U.S. offering conversions. The most common conversions have been from hybrid electric cars to plug-in hybrid, but due to the different technology used in hybrids by each carmaker, the easiest conversions are for 2004–2009 Toyota Prius and for the Ford Escape/Mercury Mariner Hybrid . [ 41 ] Advantages compared to ICE vehicles [ edit ] PEVs have several advantages. These include improved air quality, reduced greenhouse gas emissions, noise reduction, and national security benefits. According to the Center for American Progress , PEVs are an important part of the group of technologies that will help the U.S. meet its goal under the Paris Agreement , which is a 26–28 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2025. [ 44 ] New Energy Vehicles are expected to help address issues related to environmental degradation at the global level. [ 45 ] " Improved air quality [ edit ] See also: Environmental aspects of the electric car Electric cars , as well as plug-in hybrids operating in all-electric mode , emit no harmful tailpipe pollutants from the onboard source of power, such as particulates ( soot ), volatile organic compounds , hydrocarbons , carbon monoxide , ozone , lead , and various oxides of nitrogen . However, like ICE cars, electric cars emit particulates from brake and tyres. [ 46 ] Depending on the source of the electricity used to recharge the batteries, air pollutant emissions are shifted to the location of the generation plants where they can be more easily captured from flue gases. [ 47 ] Cities with chronic air pollution problems, such as Los Angeles , México City , Santiago, Chile , São Paulo , Beijing , Bangkok and Kathmandu may also gain local clean air benefits by shifting the harmful emission to electric generation plants located outside the cities. Lower greenhouse gas emissions [ edit ] See also: Environmental aspects of the electric car and Greenhouse gas emissions in plug-in hybrids RechargeIT converted Toyota Prius plug-in hybrids at Google 's Mountain View campus. The garage has recharging facilities powered by solar panels . Plug-in electric vehicles operating in all-electric mode do not emit greenhouse gases from the onboard source of power, but from the point of view of a well-to-wheel assessment , the extent of the benefit also depends on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation . This fact has been referred to as the long tailpipe of plug-in electric vehicles. From the perspective of a full life cycle analysis , the electricity used to recharge the batteries must be generated from renewable or clean sources such as wind , solar , hydroelectric , or nuclear power for PEVs to have almost none or zero well-to-wheel emissions. [ 5 ] [ 47 ] In the case of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles operating in hybrid mode with assistance of the internal combustion engine, tailpipe and greenhouse emissions are lower in comparison to conventional cars because of their higher fuel economy . [ 5 ] The magnitude of the potential advantage depends on the mix of generation sources and therefore varies by country and by region. For example, France can obtain significant emission benefits from electric and plug-in hybrids because most of its electricity is generated by nuclear power plants ; similarly, most regions of Canada are primarily powered with hydroelectricity, nuclear, or natural gas which have no or very low emissions at the point of generation; and the state of California , where most energy comes from natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear plants can also secure substantial emission benefits. The United Kingdom also has a significant potential to benefit from PEVs as low carbon sources such as wind turbines dominate the generation mix. Nevertheless, the location of the plants is not relevant when considering greenhouse gas emission because their effect is global. [ 47 ] Lifecycle GHG emissions are complex to calculate, but compared to ICE cars generally while the EV battery causes higher emissions during vehicle manufacture this excess carbon debt is paid back after several months of driving. [ 48 ] Lower operating and maintenance costs [ edit ] Internal combustion engines are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion as most of the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is idling. Electric motors , on the other hand, are more efficient at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. Electric drive vehicles do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through regenerative braking . [ 49 ] [ 47 ] Typically, conventional gasoline engines effectively use only 15% of the fuel energy content to move the vehicle or to power accessories, and diesel engines can reach on-board efficiencies of 20%, while electric drive vehicles typically have on-board efficiencies of around 80%. [ 49 ] The operating cost of the Toyota Prius Plug-in Hybrid in the U.S. is estimated at US$0.03 per mile while operating in all-electric mode . [ 49 ] [ 50 ] All-electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles also have lower maintenance costs as compared to internal combustion vehicles, since electronic systems break down much less often than the mechanical systems in conventional vehicles, and the fewer mechanical systems onboard last longer due to the better use of the electric engine. All-electric PEVs do not require oil changes and other routine maintenance checks. [ 49 ] [ 47 ] Less dependence on imported oil [ edit ] See also: Energy resilience , Energy security , and Mitigation of peak oil Evolution of oil prices since 1987 (average Brent spot prices – adjusted for U.S. inflation) For many developing countries , and particularly for the poorest African countries, oil imports have an adverse impact on the government budget and deteriorate their terms of trade thus jeopardizing their balance of payments , all leading to lower economic growth. [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Through the gradual replacement of internal combustion engine vehicles for electric cars and plug-in hybrids , electric drive vehicles can contribute significantly to lessen the dependence of the transport sector on imported oil as well as contributing to the development of a more resilient energy supply . [ 47 ] [ 53 ] [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Vehicle-to-grid [ edit ] Main article: Vehicle-to-grid Plug-in electric vehicles offer users the opportunity to sell electricity stored in their batteries back to the power grid , thereby helping utilities to operate more efficiently in the management of their demand peaks. [ 56 ] A vehicle-to-grid (V2G) system would take advantage of the fact that most vehicles are parked an average of 95 percent of the time. During such idle times the electricity stored in the batteries could be transferred from the PEV to the power lines and back to the grid. In the U.S. this transfer back to the grid have an estimated value to the utilities of up to $4,000 per year per car. [ 57 ] In a V2G system it would also be expected that battery electric (BEVs) and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) would have the capability to communicate automatically with the power grid to sell demand response services by either delivering electricity into the grid or by throttling their charging rate. [ 56 ] [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Disadvantages [ edit ] Tesla Model S electric car (left) and Fisker Karma plug-in hybrid (right) at the parking spots reserved for green cars at San Francisco International Airport Cost of batteries [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle battery As of 2020 [update] , plug-in electric vehicles are significantly more expensive as compared to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles and hybrid electric vehicles due to the additional cost of their lithium-ion battery pack. Cost reductions through advances in battery technology and higher production volumes will allow plug-in electric vehicles to be more competitive with conventional internal combustion engine vehicles. [ 60 ] Bloomberg New Energy Finance (BNEF) concludes that battery costs are on a trajectory to make electric vehicles without government subsidies as affordable as internal combustion engine cars in most countries by 2022. BNEF projects that by 2040, long-range electric cars will cost less than US$22,000 expressed in 2016 dollars. BNEF expects electric car battery costs to be well below US$120 per kWh by 2030, and to fall further thereafter as new chemistries become available. [ 61 ] Availability of recharging infrastructure [ edit ] Converted Toyota Prius plug-in hybrids recharging at San Francisco City Hall charging station See also: Charging station and Range anxiety Despite the widespread assumption that plug-in recharging will take place overnight at home, residents of cities, apartments, dormitories, and townhouses do not have garages or driveways with available power outlets, and they might be less likely to buy plug-in electric vehicles unless recharging infrastructure is developed. [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Electrical outlets or charging stations near their places of residence, in commercial or public parking lots , streets and workplaces are required for these potential users to gain the full advantage of PHEVs, and in the case of EVs, to avoid the fear of the batteries running out energy before reaching their destination, commonly called range anxiety . [ 63 ] [ 64 ] Even house dwellers might need to charge at the office or to take advantage of opportunity charging at shopping centers. [ 65 ] However, this infrastructure is not in place and it will require investments by both the private and public sectors. [ 64 ] Battery swapping [ edit ] Main article: Charging station § Battery swapping See also: Tesla Supercharger and Better Place (company) Better Place 's battery switching station in Israel A different approach to resolve the problems of range anxiety and lack of recharging infrastructure for electric vehicles was developed by Better Place but was not successful in the United States in the 2010s. As of 2020 [update] battery swapping is available in China and is planned for other countries. [ 66 ] Potential overload of local electrical grids [ edit ] The existing low-voltage network , and local transformers in particular, may not have enough capacity to handle the additional power load that might be required in certain areas with high plug-in electric car concentrations. As recharging a single electric-drive car could consume three times as much electricity as a typical home, overloading problems may arise when several vehicles in the same neighborhood recharge at the same time, or during the normal summer peak loads. To avoid such problems, utility executives recommend owners to charge their vehicles overnight when the grid load is lower or to use smarter electric meters that help control demand. When market penetration of plug-in electric vehicles begins to reach significant levels, utilities will have to invest in improvements for local electrical grids in order to handle the additional loads related to recharging to avoid blackouts due to grid overload. Also, some experts have suggested that by implementing variable time-of-day rates, utilities can provide an incentive for plug-in owners to recharge mostly overnight when rates are lower. [ 64 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] In the five years from 2014 to 2019, EVs increased in number and range, and doubled power draw and energy per session. Charging increased after midnight, and decreased in the peak hours of early evening. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Risks associated with noise reduction [ edit ] Main article: Electric vehicle warning sounds The 2011 Nissan Leaf had a switch to manually turn off its electric warning sound system. Electric cars and plug-in hybrids when operating in all-electric mode at low speeds produce less roadway noise as compared to vehicles propelled by an internal combustion engine , thereby reducing harmful noise health effects . However, blind people or the visually impaired consider the noise of combustion engines a helpful aid while crossing streets, hence plug-in electric cars and conventional hybrids could pose an unexpected hazard when operating at low speeds. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] Several tests conducted in the U.S. have shown that this is a valid concern, as vehicles operating in electric mode can be particularly hard to hear below 20 mph (30 km/h) for all types of road users and not only the visually impaired. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] At higher speeds the sound created by tire friction and the air displaced by the vehicle start to make sufficient audible noise. [ 72 ] Therefore, in the 2010s laws were passed in many countries mandating warning sounds at low speeds. Risks of battery fire [ edit ] Main article: Plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents Frontal crash test of a Volvo C30 DRIVe Electric to assess the safety of the battery pack Lithium-ion batteries may suffer thermal runaway and cell rupture if overheated or overcharged, and in extreme cases this can lead to combustion. [ 76 ] Reignition may occur days or months after the original fire has been extinguished. [ 77 ] To reduce these risks, lithium-ion battery packs contain fail-safe circuitry that shuts down the battery when its voltage is outside the safe range. [ 78 ] [ page needed ] [ 79 ] Several plug-in electric vehicle fire incidents have taken place since the introduction of mass-production plug-in electric vehicles in 2008. Most of them have been thermal runaway incidents related to the lithium-ion batteries. General Motors , Tesla , and Nissan have published a guide for firefighters and first responders to properly handle a crashed plug-in electric-drive vehicle and safely disable its battery and other high voltage systems. [ 80 ] [ 81 ] Car dealers' reluctance to sell [ edit ] With the exception of Tesla and other EV manufacturers that sell directly , almost all new cars in the United States are sold through dealerships , so they play a crucial role in the sales of electric vehicles, and negative attitudes can hinder early adoption of plug-in electric vehicles. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] Dealers decide which cars they want to stock, and a salesperson can have a significant impact on how a customer feels about a prospective purchase. Salespeople have ample knowledge of internal combustion cars but often do not have time to learn about a technology that represents a fraction of their overall sales. [ 82 ] As with any new technology, and in the particular case of advanced technology vehicles, retailers are central to ensuring that buyers, especially those switching to a new technology, have the information and support they need to gain the full benefits of adopting this new technology. [ 83 ] Car dealerships can play a role in the sales of plug-in electric vehicles. Shown a dealership exhibiting first generation Chevrolet Volts . There are several reasons for the reluctance of some dealers to sell plug-in electric vehicles. PEVs do not offer car dealers the same profits as a gasoline-powered cars. Plug-in electric vehicles take more time to sell because of the additional time required to explain a new technology, which hurts overall sales and the commissions of salespeople. Electric vehicles also may require less maintenance, resulting in the loss of recurring service revenue, and thus undermines the biggest source of dealer profits, their service departments. According to the National Automobile Dealers Association (NADS), dealers on average make three times as much profit from service as they do from new car sales. [ 82 ] Government incentives and policies [ edit ] Main article: Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles See also: Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles in the U.S. See also: Government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles in California See also: EU average fleet CO2 emissions See also: Phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles Togg C-SUV [ 84 ] produced by Togg , [ 85 ] a Turkish automotive company established in 2018 for producing EVs . [ 86 ] [ 87 ] [ 84 ] Several national, provincial, and local governments around the world have introduced policies to support the mass market adoption of plug-in electric vehicles. A variety of policies have been established to provide direct financial support to consumers and manufacturers; non-monetary incentives; subsidies for the deployment of charging infrastructure; procurement of electric vehicle for government fleets; and long term regulations with specific targets. [ 19 ] [ 88 ] All-electric car on a bus lane in Oslo Financial incentives for consumers aim to make plug-in electric car purchase price competitive with conventional cars due to the still higher up front cost of electric vehicles. Among the financial incentives there are one-time purchase incentives such as tax credits , purchase grants, exemptions from import duties, and other fiscal incentives; exemptions from road , bridge and tunnel tolls , and from congestion pricing fees; and exemption of registration and annual use vehicle fees. Some countries, like France, also introduced a bonus–malus CO 2 based tax system that penalize fossil-fuel vehicle sales. [ 19 ] [ 88 ] [ 89 ] As of 2020 [update] , monetary incentives for electrically chargeable vehicles are available, among others, in several European Union member states , China, the United States, the UK, Japan, Norway, some provinces in Canada, South Korea, India, Israel, Colombia, and Costa Rica. [ 19 ] [ 90 ] [ 91 ] Timeline of national targets for full ICE phase out [ clarification needed ] or 100% ZEV car sales [ 19 ] [ 92 ] Selected countries Year Norway (100% ZEV sales) 2025 Denmark 2030 Iceland Ireland Netherlands (100% ZEV sales) Sweden United Kingdom 2040 France Canada (100% ZEV sales) Singapore Sri Lanka (100% HEV or PEV stock) Germany (100% ZEV sales) 2050 U.S. (only 10 ZEV states) Japan (100% HEV/PHEV/ZEV sales) Costa Rica (100% ZEV sales) Among the non-monetary incentives there are several perks such allowing plug-in vehicles access to bus lanes and high-occupancy vehicle lanes , free parking and free charging. [ 88 ] In addition, in some countries or cities that restrict private car ownership (purchase quota system for new vehicles), or have implemented permanent driving restrictions (no-drive days), the schemes often exclude electric vehicles from the restrictions to promote their adoption. [ 89 ] [ 93 ] [ 90 ] [ 94 ] For example, in Beijing , the license plate lottery scheme specifies a fixed number of vehicle purchase permits each year, but to promote the electrification of its fleet, the city government split the number of purchase permits into two lots, one for conventional vehicles, and another dedicated for all-electric vehicle applicants. [ 89 ] In the case of cities with driving alternate-days based on the license plate number, such as San José, Costa Rica , since 2012, São Paulo and Bogotá since 2014, and Mexico City since 2015, all-electric vehicles were excluded from the driving restrictions. [ 90 ] [ 94 ] [ 95 ] [ 96 ] Some government have also established long term regulatory signals with specific target timeframes such as ZEV mandates, national or regional CO 2 emissions regulations , stringent fuel economy standards, and the phase out of internal combustion engine vehicle sales. [ 19 ] [ 88 ] For example, Norway set a national goal that all new car sales by 2025 should be zero emission vehicles ( electric or hydrogen ). [ 97 ] [ 98 ] Sign for London's Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ). A fee is charged to the most polluting vehicles entering Central London . Also, some cities are planning to establish zero-emission zones (ZEZ) restricting traffic access into an urban cordon area or city center where only zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) are allowed access. In such areas, all internal combustion engine vehicles are banned. [ 99 ] [ 100 ] As of June 2020 [update] , Oxford is slated to be the first city to implement a ZEZ scheme, beginning with a small area scheduled to go into effect by mid 2021. The plan is to expand the clean air zone gradually into a much larger zone, until the ZEZ encompasses the majority of the city center by 2035. [ 101 ] [ 102 ] As of May 2020 [update] , other cities planning to gradually introduce ZEZ, or partial or total ban fossil fuel powered vehicles include, among others, Amsterdam (2030), [ 103 ] Athens (2025), [ 104 ] Barcelona (2030), [ 104 ] Brussels (2030/2035), [ 99 ] Copenhagen (2030), [ 104 ] London (2020/2025), [ 99 ] Los Angeles (2030), [ 104 ] Madrid (2025), [ 105 ] Mexico City (2025), [ 105 ] Milan (2030), [ 104 ] Oslo (2024/2030), [ 99 ] Paris (2024/2030), [ 99 ] Quito (2030), [ 104 ] Rio de Janeiro (2030), [ 104 ] Rome (2024/2030), [ 99 ] [ 106 ] Seattle (2030), [ 104 ] and Vancouver (2030). [ 104 ] Production plug-in electric vehicles available [ edit ] See also: List of modern production plug-in electric vehicles and electric car use by country The General Motors EV1 was the first mass-produced and purpose-designed all-electric car of the modern era from a major automaker. During the 1990s several highway-capable plug-in electric cars were produced in limited quantities, all were battery electric vehicles . PSA Peugeot Citroën launched several electric "Électrique" versions of its models starting in 1991. Other models were available through leasing mainly in California . Popular models included the General Motors EV1 and the Toyota RAV4 EV . Some of the latter were sold to the public and were still in use by the early 2010s. [ 107 ] In the late 2000s began a new wave of mass production plug-in electric cars, motorcycles and light trucks. However, as of 2011 [update] , most electric vehicles in the world roads were low-speed, low-range neighborhood electric vehicles (NEVs) or electric quadricycles . [ 108 ] Sales of low-speed electric vehicles experienced considerable growth in China between 2012 and 2016, with an estimated NEV stock between 3 million to 4 million units, with most powered by lead-acid batteries . [ 109 ] As of December 2019 [update] , according to the International Energy Agency , there were about 250 models of highway-capable plug-in electric passenger cars available for sale in the world, up from 70 in 2014. [ 19 ] There are also available several commercial models of electric light commercial vehicles, plug-in motorcycles, all-electric buses, and plug-in heavy-duty trucks. The Renault–Nissan–Mitsubishi Alliance is the world's leading light-duty electric vehicle manufacturer. Since 2010, the Alliance's global all-electric vehicle sales totaled almost 725,000 units, including those manufactured by Mitsubishi Motors through December 2018, now part of the Alliance. [ 110 ] Its best selling all-electric Nissan Leaf was the world's top selling plug-in electric car in 2013 and 2014. [ 111 ] Tesla is the world's second largest plug-in electric passenger car manufacturer with global sales since 2012 of over 532,000 units as of December 2018 [update] . [ 112 ] Its Model S was the world's top selling plug-in car in 2015 and 2016, [ 111 ] [ 113 ] and its Model 3 was the world's best selling plug-in electric car in 2018. [ 114 ] Ranking next is BYD Auto with more than 529,000 plug-in passenger cars delivered in China through December 2018. [ 115 ] [ 116 ] [ 117 ] [ 118 ] Its Qin plug-in hybrid is the company's top selling model with almost 137,000 units sold in China through December 2018.
