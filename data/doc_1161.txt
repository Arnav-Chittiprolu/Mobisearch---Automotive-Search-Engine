The range included numerous body configurations, and though collectively referred to as the W-124, official internal chassis designations varied by body style: saloon ( W 124 ); estate ( S 124 ); coupé ( C 124 ); cabriolet ( A 124 ); limousine ( V 124 ); rolling chassis ( F 124 ); and long-wheelbase rolling chassis ( VF 124 ). From 1993, the 124 series was officially marketed as the E-Class . The W 124 followed the 123 series from 1984 and was succeeded by the W 210 E-Class (saloons, estates, rolling chassis) after 1995, and the C 208 CLK-Class (coupés, and cabriolets) in 1997. In North America, the W124 was launched in early November 1985 as a 1986 model and marketed through the 1995 model year. Pre-series production began at the beginning of November 1984, with press presentation on Monday, 26 November 1984 in Seville , Spain, and customer deliveries and European market launch starting in January 1985. History [ edit ] The 1984 W124, without plastic door side panels The 1989 W124 retains the front portion of the 1984 model, and includes plastic door side panels and painted mirrors The W124 was a mid-sized vehicle platform, which entered planning in the autumn of 1976 under development Hans Scherenberg. In July 1977, the W124 program officially began, with R&D commencing work under newly appointed Werner Breitschwerdt. In April 1978, decisions were made to base it on the Mercedes-Benz W201 model program. By April 1979, a package plan was completed for the program, laying out the guidelines of the project. During the winter of 1980–1981, the final exterior for the W124 program was completed, chosen as the leading proposal by design director Bruno Sacco, and approved by the board of management in early 1981. By mid-1982, the first prototypes reflective of the production design, were assembled and sent to testing. In March 1984, pilot production commenced and development of the sedan concluded with engineering sign-off. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Front suspension used a separate spring and damper with a rubber top mount with control arms directly mounted to the body, without a subframe. The rear suspension of the W124 featured the Mercedes multi-link axle introduced in 1982 with the Mercedes W201 and which is now standard on many modern cars. Estate cars (and optionally, sedans and coupés) had Citroën-like rear self-leveling suspension with suspension struts rather than shock absorbers, gas-filled suspension spheres to provide damping and an under bonnet pressurizing pump. Unlike the traditional Citroën application, the Mercedes suspension system had a fixed ride height and employed rear coil springs to maintain the static ride height when parked. The W124 was the first Mercedes series to be fitted with the iconic 15-hole, flat-faced alloy wheels characteristic of Mercedes-Benz cars of the 1980s and 1990s. The alloy wheels were nicknamed 'Gullideckel' or manhole covers , because they resemble manhole or drainage covers in Germany, which are consistently round in shape with a series of 15- or 16-holes around the outer edge, often within a concentric ring. Gullideckel wheels in a variety of diameter and offset specifications were later incorporated into the facelift versions of the W126 S-Class, R107 SL and W201 190E series, and were also the 'non-option' wheel on the R129 SL-Class roadster. [ 9 ] Much of the 124's engineering and many of its features were advanced automotive technology at its introduction, incorporating innovations that have been adopted throughout the industry. [ 10 ] It had one of the lowest coefficient of drag (Cd) of any vehicle of the time (0.28 for the 200/200D model for the European market with 185/65 R15 tires) due to its aerodynamic body, that included plastic molding for the undercarriage to streamline airflow beneath the car, reducing fuel consumption and wind noise. It had a single windscreen wiper that had an eccentric mechanism at its base that extended the wiper's reach to the top corners of the windscreen (more than if it had traveled in a simple arc). The saloon/sedan, coupés and convertibles had optional rear headrests that would fold down remotely to improve rearward visibility when required. This feature was not available for the T-model because of its specific layout (no space to store the retractable headrests), but the estate serially came with a "neighbour-friendly" rear door that was pulled in the shut-position silently and automatically by a sensor-controlled servomotor. This allowed the use of a tighter fitting rear gate, minimizing the cabin noise in the T-model - sometimes an area of concern for station wagons. [ 11 ] The estate cars (chassis designation S124) came in 5 or 7-seat models, the 7-seater having a rear-facing bench seat that folded flush luggage compartment cover and an optional (in the US until 1994) retractable cargo net . To provide a flat loading floor with the seat folded down, the T-model's rear seat squab was mounted about 10 cm (3.9 in) higher than in saloons, robbing rear seat passengers of some head room. [ 11 ] The S124 estate continued in production alongside the new W210 until the S210 estate launched more than a year later. A two-door coupé version was also built, with the chassis designation C124. The E 320, E 220, and E 200 cabriolets ceased production in 1997. Indian assembly (in a joint-venture with Telco called Mercedes-Benz India) began in March 1995. [ 1 ] Offered with five-cylinder diesel engines built by Mercedes' Indian partner Bajaj Tempo , [ 12 ] the W124 was replaced there in December 1997. [ 1 ] Models [ edit ] Initial launch range [ edit ] Upon launch of serial production in January 1985 (the sedan went on sale in December 1984), the range consisted of seven models, to replace the seven W123 models in production (200, 230E, 250, 280E, 200D, 240D, 300D). The four cylinder petrol range consisted of the M102 powered 200 and 230E models. Both were carried over from the previous generation but with refined timing and compression ratios for better performance. The former had the 1997cc engine with the Stromberg 175 CDT carburetor, and the latter, bored out to 2299 cc, had the Bosch KE-Jetronic fuel injection. The six cylinder petrol range had the 260E and 300E models. Unlike the predecessors, which had two different engines, these were now powered by the new M103 of 2599 and 2962cc displacements, differing only in cylinder bore size. The diesel range was manifested by the 200D, 250D , and 300D with the new OM601 , OM602 , and OM603 engine series in four, five, and six-cylinder configurations. All of the engines represented the modular OHC design with a 15° incline. Petrol motors featured breakerless transistorised TSZ ignition. Diesels had the mechanical injection with Bosch fuel pump/distributor. Standard was the 4 speed manual transmission, except on the six-cylinder models which had the overdrive 5 speed, available as option for others. The W4A 020 (722.4) 4-speed automatic was also available as an option for all except the 300E, which had the stronger W4A 040 (722.3). Power steering was standard on all models. Optional were the rear adjustable and self-levelling hydropneumatic suspension mixed with coil springs and anti-lock braking system . 1985: Estates, Emissions and Exports [ edit ] In July the range gained another model, the 200E , only for the Italian market. This fuel injected variant of the 200 was meant to suit Italy's tax rates which were based on engine displacement – making it essential to have a more powerful offering beneath the significant 2,000 cc threshold. This version came standard with a five-speed manual transmission or with an optional automatic. The estate, S124 , went on sale in September 1985, repeating most of the sedan's range with the 200T, 230TE, 300TE, 200TD, and 250TD models. However, it lacked the 2.6-litre M103 and the 3 litre OM603. The latter, 300TD , would join the lineup a year later. Sales to the United States for the 1986 Model year began in autumn with the sole offering of the 300E sedan in both five-speed and automatic versions. Mercedes-Benz had to modify production for the US market to comply with the Environmental Protection Agency 's (EPA) automotive emission control regulations and the US Department of Transportation passenger safety regulations. The W124 design incorporated most of these requirements from the beginning, meaning that the only visible cue for American-destined W124s were the rectangular sealed-beam headlights . Although the US cars were still 100 kg heavier than their European counterparts, engine performance was identical for the duration of production. While the United States strictly enforced its emission control laws, the European Community's dedication to emission control was much more lax. The 1970 70/220/EEC directive would slowly evolve into the European emission standards that came into effect in January 1993 as the Euro 1, with mandatory catalytic converters on petrol-engined cars. This gave automotive producers plenty of time to adjust their production to comply with these requirements. Mercedes-Benz began doing so in September 1985, marking its vehicles with three labels: ECE , retroactively applied to unmodified vehicles; KAT , applied to those equipped with the three-way catalytic converter; and RÜF (Rückrüstfahrzeug, which loosely translates as 'retrofit vehicle'), engineered for later installation of the catalytic converter. Engines equipped with catalytic converters also got the EZL ignition system, where distributor advance would now be governed by the ECU taking into account crankshaft and throttle positions, intake vacuum, and air and coolant temperatures, as opposed to the analogue vacuum-driven ignition advance of the TSZ. Only the carburetted 200 and 200T models remained in their original ECE versions. The effect of the different emissions modifications varied according to type and engine, with the six-cylinders losing up to 10 hp (in part from having their compression ratio decreased) and gaining up to 50 kg in weight, with acceleration, top speed, and fuel expenditure suffering accordingly. 1986: Turbos and catalysts [ edit ] The transitional state for optional catalytic converters ended in September 1986, when they became standard, but the RÜF version would remain a discount option in certain markets. This included the carburettor fed 200 and 200T models, which gained a new double barrel Pierburg 2EE downdraft carburettor and EZL ignition. For the American 1987 MY, Mercedes-Benz introduced the Garret T3 Turbocharger on the OM603, resulting in the 300D Turbo and 300TD Turbo models, initially only available in the United States. These were seen as successors to the 300D Turbodiesel W123 range, which was the sole representative of that car in the United States from model year 1984 through 1986. Also for 1987, the 5 speed manual option was pulled out for the 300E sedan, leaving all American cars as automatics. It was during this time that Mercedes-Benz became increasingly concerned at the abundance of "grey" imports . The US legislature not only allowed for registration of privately bought foreign car, but also for third parties to officially import the cars for distribution without paying any commissions to the official dealers. Prior to 1980 the scale was superficial, but as the EPA and CAFE regulations put severe restrictions, compelling Mercedes-Benz to abandon on its petrol engine range of all save the flagship models, grey import dealers filled the void. By 1985 60,000 vehicles were being imported into the United States, with every third being a Mercedes. With the launch of the W124 model (and parallel new generation of motors for the S-class and the SL) whose performance was now equal to the models on the home market, Mercedes-Benz pursued a multi-million US dollar congressional lobbying campaign that would ultimately manifest in the Imported Vehicle Safety Compliance Act [ 13 ] effectively banning private import of all vehicles less than 25 years old. 1987: Coupés and 4Matics [ edit ] In early 1987 Mercedes-Benz presented the 2-door coupé. Compared to the sedan, it had a shorter wheelbase and lower roofline, with pillarless glazing. For the comfort of the rear passengers, instead of the large panoramic window of the predecessor, the ceiling padding extended further aback below the rear window glass. The model range consisted of two models: the 230CE and 300CE , with the same M102 and M103 engines as for the sedan/estate, but with the 5-speed manual standard for both cars. The 4 Matic all-wheel drive system first introduced on the W124 One of the major novelties for 1987 was the introduction of the 4Matic all-wheel drive system, developed to rival Audi's Quattro and BMW's Xdrive . The system used a number of sensors to determine loss of traction and would automatically engage the central differential providing 4 wheel drive, and then successively lock it and the rear differential as road conditions dictated. The system was initially offered for the 260E, 300E, 300D sedans as well as 300D and 300TD Turbo estates (with the 300D Turbo sedan joining in the following year). All aspirated engines could have the choice with either the manual or automatic transmission. Another major milestone in 1987 was Mercedes-Benz discontinuing its W124 diesel range for North America for the upcoming 1988 MY. This was caused by the reliability issues with the Diesel particulate filter mandated by the California Air Resources Board . Instead, the petrol-engined 300TE was added (hitherto, the only T-model offered in North America had been the diesel). Previously reserved for the American market, the 300D Turbo and 300TD Turbo became available in all markets during 1987. 1988: Clean diesel and fuel injection [ edit ] Addressing the issue of Diesel emissions, Mercedes Benz made a major modification to the OM 603, redesigning the cylinder head pre-chambers with angled fuel injection . This facilitated more efficient combustion and gave a small power boost. Also, the particulate filter location was moved further away from the engine, while the injection pumps got altitude correction. The end result was a 40 percent reduction in emissions. Aspirated diesels started receiving this technology in February 1989. The withdrawal of the turbocharged motors from the US market included the 190D 2.5 Turbo, powered by the OM602 equipped with the Garrett T25 turbocharger. To take advantage of the production capacity, Mercedes-Benz opted to add this engine to the W124 lineup as the 250D Turbo. In parallel to the facelift of the W201 190, Mercedes-Benz made standard some of the previous extra-cost options: namely the ABS, heated driver's door mirrors and the tank, jets and hoses of the windscreen washer across the whole range of the 124 series. Also in 1988, Mercedes-Benz began its commitment to fully transition to fuel injection. For this it began to offer the 200E and 200TE models – with the former already having been offered in Italy – to supplement the 200 and 200T as new entry models, actively encouraging dealers to promote them to cost-sensitive customers, sometimes, as a no-extra cost discount given the very subtle price difference. For the United States, the 300E and 300TE were joined by the 300CE coupé and the 260E for the 1989 model year. 1989: First facelift and 24 valve [ edit ] In September 1989 the whole series underwent its first facelift. Externally the cars can be distinguished with plastic side panels, whose top interface had bright chrome strip that continued across the front and rear bumpers. Chrome was also introduced in door handles and hub caps. Body coloured mirrors completed the look. Customers could also order a sportline trim with tighter 'sports' suspension, lower driveline and wider 205/60R15 tyres on wider 7J alloy rims (instead of the standard 195/65 R15 on 6.5 inch stamped steel), The facelift was also the curtain call of the RÜF vehicles, as all post facelift W124s now had the catalytic converter as standard. One major milestone was the introduction of the M104 engine with a double overhead camshaft cylinder head. Mercedes-Benz has deployed DOHC on the popular 190E 2.3-16 performance model, but these were designed and built by Ford-Cosworth whereas, the M104 was internally designed. The model also introduced a two position variable valve timing on the intake shaft and anti-knock ignition correction for the ECU. In the same format as the W201, the models were designated as the 300E-24, 300TE-24 and 300CE-24 , indicating the number of valves involved. Sharing the block of the 3.0 litre M103, the motor provided a peak 40 hp boost without any reduction in fuel economy. The facelifted model went on sale to the United States as the 1990 MY where the 260E was rebadged as the 300E 2.6 . Joining it was the 300E 4Matic and 300TE 4Matic models. 1990: Exports, EGR and overdrive [ edit ] In June 1990, two Italy-specific models were introduced: the 250TD Turbo estate and the 200CE coupé, to be in lower tax bands as per smaller engine displacement. Also in 1990, the diesels would make a comeback into the US market for the 1991 MY, but with the turbocharged five-cylinder OM 602 engines, badged as 300D 2.5 Turbo and 300TD 2.5 Turbo. Standard on the US models and optional on other turbocharged diesels was exhaust gas recirculation used in conjunction DPF and oxidation catalysts. Unlike the Petrol engine converters, these did not hamper engine performance, but did offer reduced emissions making the option a worthy investment in markets where road tax was tied to CO 2 . The technology would be offered on atmospheric Diesels in spring of 1991. The other major event for 1990 was the debut of the W5A 030 722.5 automatic transmission for the M104 engined models. It featured an additional overdrive module. 1990 was also the curtain call for carburettors, as the final 200 and 200T were built in June. (The carburettor would carry on in the 190 until January 1991, and in the W460 230G G-wagen until mid-year 1992, though this model was for extra-European export) 1991: 500E [ edit ] Main article: Mercedes-Benz 500 E 1992 Mercedes-Benz 500 E (W124; US) 1992 Mercedes-Benz 500 E (W124; US) The high performance version of the W124, the 500E , was presented in October 1990, with production beginning in February 1991 for spring launch. [ 14 ] It used the 5.0 L 32-valve V8 M119 engine based on the one used in the 500 SL (R129) roadster. It was created and built in close cooperation with Porsche , who engineered the suspension and chassis design with a performance bias. Mercedes entered an agreement with Porsche to assemble the vehicles at their plant in Zuffenhausen , as the sportscar maker was in crisis and its factory capacity was underutilized. [ 15 ] Porsche also constructed the chassis for the more restrained 400E , which lacked the 500E's wider fenders – this was in essence identical to the 500E's chassis. [ 16 ] 1991 saw discontinuation of several models, namely the 4Matic 260E and non turbocharged 300D (with the remaining models being available with automatic transmission only). Additionally the underpowered and poorly selling 200TD was also retired. 1992: Petrol DOHC and cabriolet [ edit ] Mercedes-Benz incrementally introduced DOHC technology, first in the Cosworth built 16-valve M102s for the 190, then the 24-valve M104 engine & the M119 32-valve engines in 1989. In 1991 it was joined by the 3.2 litre M104 on the new W140 S-class, and in summer 1992 Mercedes-Benz was ready to fully transition to the new engine family across the whole mid-range. All, except the 2.0 litre M111 would gain the new Bosch LH Jetronic with HFM system in place of the KE-Jetronic with the EZL ignition and would revert to the pre-catalyst 10.0 compression ratio. Mercedes-Benz also used this opportunity to optimise the manufacturing process, by making a universal bore size of 89.9 mm for all four engines, thus achieving two identical cylinder blocks and altering stroke ratio using a range of crankshafts and rods, rather than having to machine four sets of blocks for a universal 80.25 mm stroke. In place of the four cylinder 1997 cc M102 was the more undersquare (78.7 mm stroke) 1998 cc M111 , represented in the 200E , 200TE & 200CE models, with the latter being available now in Greece and Portugal, in addition to Italy. Unlike the other engines, this had a Siemens Pressure Engine Control system which timed injection from manifold pressure (instead of the hot wire mass airflow sensor used in the LH-Jetronic), lacked the variable valve timing mechanism on the intake camshaft and had a smaller compression rise to 9.6. A boost of 15% (18hp) in power and 10% (18 Nm) in torque was provided. The bigger and very oversquare (95.5 mm bore) 2299 cc M102 of the 230 series was replaced by the almost square 2199 cc M111 in the new 220E, 220TE & 220CE models. Despite the smaller displacement, the boost was 14 & 6 % (18 hp and 12 Nm). Conversely, the almost square (82.9 mm bore) six cylinder 2599 cc M103 of the 260 series, formerly represented solely on the sedan, was replaced by the very short stroke (73.5 mm) 2799 cc M104 on the 280E, which was now also available on the estate as the 280TE. Here the boost was most dramatic, a 23% increase in both power (37 hp) and torque (50 Nm). The top end oversquare (88.5 mm ) 2962 cc M103 300 series and the M104 300-24 series was replaced by more stroking (84 mm) 3199 cc M104, as the 320E, 320CE & 320CE .This stroke ratio was also the same for the OM603 diesel allowing to use the same crankshafts. Compared with the M103, a 22% boost was facilitated (40 hp and 55 Nm) and compared to the 300-24 M104, peak power remained at 220 hp, but shifted to much lower rpm (from 6400 to 5500), torque also got a 17% boost (45 Nm). The AWD 4Matic 300E and 300TE models would retain the OHC M103 engine. 1993 MY US export retained the 300 series badging ( 300E , 300CE & 300CE ) in spite of having the 3.2 litre engine. The 280E was badged as 300E 2.8 . Also for the 1993, export of the 4Matic models were discontinued. The other major event for 1992 was the start of the A124 Cabriolet production. After the end of the W111 280SE and 280SE 3.5 in 1971, the cabriolet was absent from the line-up for more than two decades. The opportunity for its revival came with the R129 SL, which itself was based on the C124 coupé, where extensive structural reinforcements and emergency gas-fired anti rollover bar enabled compliance with safety regulations. Encouraged by the success of the roadster, Mercedes-Benz embarked on developing a full cabriolet, where the rear passenger headrests covers would act as braces. In Europe production began as the 300CE-24 inheriting the 3.0 M104 motor and the name of the now discontinued C124 namesake. For the United States 1993 MY, Mercedes offered the 300CE cabriolet with the 3.2 litre M104, making it a unique pre-facelift model for that market. 1993: The E-Class [ edit ] In August 1993 Mercedes-Benz released the second facelift of the W124. This time the changes were much more drastic, particularly in the fascia which was modelled after the W140 S-class and the newly released W202 C-Class, as part of the company's new corporate styling with regard to the radiator grille that was now integrated into the bonnet's contours, along with the pearl coloured turn indicators. The boot cover was also given a small workover, as were the taillights. Bumper strips on the aprons were now body coloured. The wheels got new hub caps to complete the look. The petrol engines remained the same for the sedan, estate, and coupé (although the 2.8 litre M104 lost 4 horsepower to fit into a lower tax band), whilst the cabriolet gained the latter's 2.2 litre M111 and 3.2 litre M104, as well as the 2.0 M111 for Greece, Portugal and Italy. The DOHC transition continued on the diesel range, and with the facelift, the 2.5 and 3.0 OM602 and OM603 gained the new 20 and 24 valve cylinder heads, as the OM605 and OM606 motors, providing 20% more power. This did not affect the turbocharged models which would retain the SOHC diesels. The facelift coincided with the a major re-badging and rebranding that began with launch of the Mercedes-Benz C-Class (W202) as a replacement for the W201 in March. Originally the 190 model, and hence nameplate, was to be limited to a few select models, but its popularity caused the series to become a family on its own. Applying the same logic would be unfeasible as the new W202, which was to be more classy, upmarket and less adolescent. In the old system Mercedes-Benz marketed its products on a series concept which would often, but not always, coincide with the displacement that the engine made. If the car had special features, like a diesel engine or an estate (Transport) body, this would be present in the label eg 250TD. For upmarket trims or models, the suffix was S for Sonder (literally translates as special, and figuratively - as exclusive). In 1972, to clarify its selling strategy the product lines were split into the unnamed "standard class", encompassing the /8 models and the S-Class, encompassing models of the newly released 116 and 107 chassis. However, by the early 1990s, the standard range ballooned to a point where in addition to encompassing more than 8 series at any one time, with some specific models (turbocharged diesels, AWD 4Matics) in several body styles, it now had to incorporate the W463 , which, unlike the W460 Geländewagen was not a commercial vehicle and was sold through regular Mercedes showrooms. At the same time, having the "S-class" broadly applied to the whole premiere range did not follow, particularly with the R107 SL after 1981, but it did go well for the W126 series and the following W140. Upon the launch of the W202, Mercedes-Benz decided to make a third product line, opposite to the S-class, the Compact or C-Class , and to avoid it being confused with the existing C124 and A124 models, the label now preceded the model code. The template was well received, and in 1993 the company decided to re-badge, and, effectively, re-brand, the whole product line in a similar fashion, with the W140 now officially privatising the S-Class, the R129 SL becoming the SL-Class , the W463 G-Wagen - the G-Class, leaving W124 series as the sole representative of the unnamed "standard class". Here Daimler chose to keep the common E, which originally stood for Enspritz, or injected, but after the retirement of 200 and 200T in 1990, has become redundant. It was reversed it into the Executive or E-Class. Attributes of body styles such as C or T were dropped. Diesel powered cars were punctuated with a Diesel badge and those turbocharged - Turbodiesel . Thus the '250TD Turbo' became the 'E250 Turbodiesel' wagon. In certain cases, the model code was adjusted to the real displacement, like the 400E, which became the E420 . For the American 1994 MY, the range was condensed to the E320 for all four body styles and the E300 Diesel for the sedan in addition to the V8 powered E420 and E500. Thus the model range under the new system was: E200 with the 2.0 litre M111 engine, available all four body styles, but the 2-door version limited to Italy, Portugal and Greece, E200 Diesel with the 2.0 litre OM601 engine available solely for the sedan (this model, the 124.120, would be only one produced continuously for the whole W124 lifecycle) E220 with the 2.2 litre M111 engine available all four body styles. E250 Diesel with the new DOHC 2.5 OM605 engine available for the sedan and estate. E250 Turbodiesel with the older OHC 2.5 OM602 engine available for the sedan and estate, with the latter being limited to Italy. E280 with the 2.8 litre M104 engine available for the sedan and estate E300 4Matic retaining the OHC M103 engine, available for the sedan and estate. E300 Diesel with the new DOHC 3.0 OM606 engine available for the sedan and estate. E300 Turbodiesel with the older OHC 3.0 OM603 engine available for the sedan and estate. E300 Turbodiesel 4Matic also keeping the OM603, available for the sedan and estate. E320 with the 3.2 litre M104, available for all four body styles E420 with the 4.2 litre M119, available only for the sedan E500 with the 5.0 litre M119, also limited to the sedan only. AMG models [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources . Please help improve this section by adding citations to reliable sources . Unsourced material may be challenged and removed . ( September 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The relation between Mercedes-Benz, its parent company Daimler and the Affalterbach based AMG was dynamic. Historically, AMG was an independent firm that specialised in both motor racing and aftermarket tuning of Mercedes-Benz models. In the late 1980s, relations between the companies began to converge, particularly with AMG's simultaneous assistance to the DTM entries and expanding its own product line with the AMG Hammer 6.0 model, which was a W124 with a transplanted M117 engine and custom made DOHC cylinder heads along with wide body kits . In 1990, cooperation was made official that AMG aftermarket parts would be offered by Mercedes-Benz on new cars from the dealer. In 1991, this is resulted in a relatively small batch of 300E-24 3.4 AMG where the 3.0 litre M104 motor was bored out to 91.5 mm. This was still sold as an aftermarket trim, but the success of this pilot project led to the full partnership evolving to the 1993 agreement were AMG models would now be featured in Mercedes-Benz showrooms. The facelifted E-Class was represented by the E36 AMG models for the estate, coupé, and cabriolet, where the 3.2 litre M104 was bored and stroked to an oversquare 91.4 x 92.0, giving a 3604 cc displacement. Combined with a 10.5 compression, racing camshafts, and exhaust system, led to an almost 25% increase in power and torque. Along with tighter suspension, reduced accumulation in shifting pattern, gave the cars a 7.2 second 0-100 km/h (62 mph) time and a 250 km/h (155 mph) electrically limited top speed, as part of the gentleman's agreement between Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen and the Federal Ministry for Digital and Transport to keep the Autobahn limit free. For the sedan, there was no E36 AMG model, as both the in-house E420 and Porsche assembled E500 were still on offer. However, here AMG too offered a performance upgrade, by treating the M119 engine to 100.0 x 94.8 mm 5956 cc displacement, the result was an 18% rise in power and 24% in torque. This made the E60 AMG the top performing sedan available in the company's lineup, and one of the fastest cars available at the time as the 5.2 0-100 km/h (62 mph) time exceeded the performance of the flagship S600 W140 sedan with the M120 V12 engine . The total amount of E36 and E60 models remains unknown, as these still remained performance packages to the parent E320 and E500 models, that could be both installed by the dealer upon ordering, hence with Mercedes-Benz warranty, or as an aftermarket upgrade by the customer. 1995–1997: End of production [ edit ] Despite the numerous new technologies being released in the post 1993 period (supercharged Kompressor M111 motors, turbocharged DOHC diesels, M112 V6 engines , the 5G-tronic transmission, ESP etc.) the E-Class W124 markup and model fluctuation remained fixed. The entry E200 2 door models, available in Greece, Italy and Portugal were made available in the home market in February (cabriolet) and December (coupé) of 1994. 1994 MY was the final year when the 124 series sedan was available in the United States, and 1995 MY for the other cars. With the debut of the W210 E-class sedan in June 1995, production of the W124 began to fold down, with the last vehicles leaving Sindelfingen in August. The E250 Diesel and E220 would continue to be supplied as CKD kits to the Chakan plant in India until June of 1996. The estates lingered on until February 1996 and there would be no overlap in production with the S210 estate, that would debut in May. Coupés would follow in March 1996, whilst the cabriolets would soldier on until July 1997. They would not have a direct replacement, as Daimler opted to use the smaller W202 C-class platform for the new Mercedes-Benz W208 series that would be badged as the CLK-Class making their respective premieres in January 1997 (Coupé) and March 1998 (Cabriolet). The 1993 W124 has a different front design, retains the plastic side panels, and has an extended rear bumper Masterpiece [ edit ] Mercedes-Benz W124 Masterpiece rear label Mercedes-Benz W124 Masterpiece gear knob In some countries, the final batch of W124 was sold as the limited edition Masterpiece in 1995. Following the impending release of its successor, the Mercedes-Benz W210 , the remaining units of W124 were fitted with additional accessories found in stock models such as walnut wood steering wheel (optional), airbag for front passenger, walnut center console glove box, electric rear blind and rear seat side window sunshade (optional). [ 17 ] There were also 4 unique pieces of accessories fitted to Masterpieces which were not available to any other W124 around the world – gear knob engraved with the word Masterpiece , stainless door sills engraved with Mercedes Benz , Masterpiece label on the right side of the boot and the new 6-hole light alloy wheels.

Mercedes-Benz S124 estate Mercedes-Benz C124 coupé A124 convertible Commercial vehicles [ edit ] As with its predecessors, the W124 platform was adapted for many specialty vehicles. Co-designed with the Binz company, a stretched six-door version was unveiled in 1989. The V124 had an 800 mm long insert at the B-pillar with an additional pair of doors and a forward facing seat bench. Production of the V124 250 D and 260 E began in May 1990, with the latter replaced by the 280 E in July 1992 and re-branded as the E 280 in August 1993. The former got the OM 605 engine of the standard sedan at the August 1993 facelift and also re-branded as the E 250 Diesel. Production ceased in July 1994. A total of 2,342 six-door limousines were built before production halted in July 1994. Unlike the predecessors, the higher roofline of the S124 estate made it the more suitable basis for commercial chassis such as ambulances, hearses, vans and motorhomes by specialty companies, such as the aforementioned Binz and also C.Miesen, Visser, Rappold, Pollmann, Stolle, Welsch, and others. These were available in short (F124) and long (VF124) wheelbases, with the latter being 650 mm longer. Parent models were the petrol 230 E and 260 E and the diesel 250 D. The latter two were replaced by the 280 E/E 280 and the OM605 motor E 250 Diesel respectively. A total of 1,266 SWB and 5,132 LWB chassis were built by the end of 1995. A SWB F124 chassis used as an ambulance in Sweden A LWB VF 124 chassis used as hearse in Germany A pair of LWB V124 taxis in Cyprus Technical parameters [ edit ] The table gives preproduction to end of production as per Daimler. [ 19 ] Daimler lists November 1984 as the start of production for the series but also lists 1985 as part of preproduction for any specific early model. No regular deliveries occurred in 1984.The W124 was also offered as a long wheelbase saloon targeted for taxi companies, but the more luxury equipped version was also used as a limousine.
