Automobiles Wikipedia:WikiProject Automobiles Template:WikiProject Automobiles Automobile Beat [ edit ] Shouldn't the Beat be moven from Sports to Kei? -- Zahn 03:12, 15 January 2007 (UTC) [ reply ] Honda Road Car Timeline [ edit ] The Stream started production in the year 2000, and is still in production. The Honda Edix/FR-V is a completely different vehicle.
Also, the Honda Acty van and trucks are still in production, now sold as commercial vehicles in Japan. MR-V [ edit ] Why is the MR-V not on the template? 82.148.96.68 18:15, 14 May 2007 (UTC) [ reply ] Updating [ edit ] This page seems to be about up to date with current announcements, but let's make sure it stays up to date as new models are introduced and old models renewed. samadam ( talk ) 23:37, 8 August 2008 (UTC) [ reply ] Integra 2002-2006 [ edit ] Why does the Integra 2002-2006 block occupy two rows? Is it supposed to indicate that the 2002 Integra replaced both the previous Integra and the Prelude? Because neither article indicates that - Honda Prelude identifies its successor as the S2000. Thanks. DH85868993 ( talk ) 02:34, 27 November 2009 (UTC) [ reply ] Element [ edit ] I think, according to American Honda Motor press release, 2011 Element will be discontinued after production ceases in about April 2011.
Currently, the template seems to show that Element is discontinued and last year is 2010. --- North wiki ( talk ) 15:40, 24 January 2011 (UTC) [ reply ] N-Box/N-Box+ and N-One [ edit ] Link to N-One article needs to be added, also these models need to be included in this template — Preceding unsigned comment added by 59.93.210.62 ( talk ) 08:46, 19 February 2013 (UTC) [ reply ] Dividing the template [ edit ] I feel like we should divide it to road cars and trucks or by countries because of how large the template is.
