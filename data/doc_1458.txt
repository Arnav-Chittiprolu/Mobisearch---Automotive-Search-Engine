'''Vehicle-to-grid''' ('''V2G''') describes a system in which [[plug-in electric vehicle]]s (PIEVs) sell [[demand response]] services to the [[electrical grid]]. Such services are either [[backfeeding]] electricity to the grid, or reducing the rate of charge from the grid at different times of the day. Demand services reduce [[demand peak]]s for grid supply, and hence reduce the probability of disruption from load variations.<ref name="dictionary">{{cite book |last1=Cleveland |first1=Cutler J. |last2=Morris |first2=Christopher |year=2006 |title=Dictionary of Energy |publisher=Elsevier |location=Amsterdam |isbn=978-0-08-044578-6 |page=[https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofener00amst/page/473 473] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/dictionaryofener00amst/page/473 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.pge.com/about/news/mediarelations/newsreleases/q2_2007/070409.shtml |title = Pacific Gas and Electric Company Energizes Silicon Valley With Vehicle-to-Grid Technology |date = 2007-04-07 |access-date = 2009-10-02 |publisher = Pacific Gas & Electric |url-status = dead |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20091209122555/http://www.pge.com/about/news/mediarelations/newsreleases/q2_2007/070409.shtml

Plug-in electric vehicles include [[battery electric vehicle]]s (BEVs) and [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s (PHEVs). They share the ability to store electricity in their [[electric vehicle battery|on-board battery module]]s, which are typically used to propel the vehicle's [[electric engine]]. V2G allows some of this [[energy storage]] to be sent to the grid, turning the vehicle into a small-scale [[grid battery]] that is eligible for claiming [[feed-in tariff]]s. A 2015 report found that vehicle owners could receive significant payments by charging their EVs at off-peak times when grid electricity is cheaper, storing it in their car battery, and selling it back to the grid at peak times when electricity prices are higher due to [[congestion pricing]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=He|first1=Y.|last2=Bhavsar|first2=P.|last3=Chowdhury|first3=M.|last4=Li|first4=Z.|date=2015-10-01|title=Optimizing the performance of vehicle-to-grid (V2G) enabled battery electric vehicles through a smart charge scheduling model|journal=International Journal of Automotive Technology|volume=16|issue=5|pages=827–837|doi=10.1007/s12239-015-0085-3|s2cid=38215809|issn=1976-3832}}</ref>

[[Rechargeable batteries]] have a finite number of [[charge cycle]]s, as well as a limited shelf-life, so V2G can reduce [[state of health|battery longevity]]. Battery capacity is a complex function of battery chemistry, charge/discharge rates, temperature, state of charge and age, but is improving as technology improves. Most studies of the effects of V2G on battery life show that slower V2G discharge rates lessen degradation, while one study suggested that using vehicles for grid storage could improve longevity.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Uddin |first1=Kotub |last2=Jackson |first2=Tim |last3=Widanage |first3=Widanalage D. |last4=Chouchelamane |first4=Gael |last5=Jennings |first5=Paul A. |last6=Marco |first6=James |title=On the possibility of extending the lifetime of lithium-ion batteries through optimal V2G facilitated by an integrated vehicle and smart-grid system |journal=Energy |date=August 2017 |volume=133 |pages=710–722 |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2017.04.116 |doi-access=free |bibcode=2017Ene...133..710U |url=http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/88018/13/WRAP-possibility-extending-lifetime-lithium-ion-batteries-Marco-2017.pdf }}</ref>

===Backup power===
Electric vehicles can generally store more than an average home's daily energy demand, and supply emergency power to a home for several days, using vehicle-to-home (V2H) transmission.

Though the concept of V2H charging is simple, putting it into action requires a technologically complex system. Charging stations must integrate software that communicates with the central grid to monitor real-time system demand.<ref name="vehicle-to-gird">{{cite web |last1=patel |first1=nirav |title=vehicle-to-grid |url=https://ev.nxccontrols.in/ |website=ev.nxccontrols.in |publisher=admin |access-date=2022-02-22 |ref=nxccontrols}}</ref><ref name="V2G" />

# Unidirectional power flow (V1G) 
# V1G with aggregated resources
# V1G with fragmented actor objectives
# Bidirectional power flow (V2G)

=== V1G/Unidirectional V2G ===
V1G involves varying the time and rate at which an electric vehicle is charged. It is also known as unidirectional managed charging services, unidirectional V2G or "smart charging". V1G approaches include charging in the middle of the day to absorb solar power that would otherwise be discarded (load shedding) and varying the charge rate to provide [[Frequency response (electrical grid)|frequency response]] or load balancing services.{{cn|date=April 2024}}

=== Bidirectional local V2G (V2H, V2L, V2B, V2X) ===
Vehicle-to-home (V2H), vehicle-to-load (V2L), vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V),<ref name=electrek20231130/> and vehicle-to-building (V2B)—sometimes collectively termed vehicle-to-everything (V2X)—use the vehicle to provide power during a power outage or to displace grid energy with energy from possibly other energy sources stored in the vehicle's battery.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.emobilitysimplified.com/2019/12/what-is-vehicle-to-grid-v1g-v2g-v2x-v2h.html |title=What are V1G, V2G and V2H / V2B / V2X smart charging? {{!}} Integrating electric vehicles into power grid |first=Pon |last=Paulraj |website=E-Mobility Simplified |date=2019-12-10 |access-date=2020-02-22}}</ref>  The source energy may be renewable; for example, vehicles charged using solar power at work during the day could power a home through the night, without pulling power from the grid.

V2G requires specialized hardware (such as bidirectional [[inverters]]), has significant energy losses and limited round-trip efficiency, and the charge/discharge cycling may shorten battery life. A 2016 V2G project in California was done as a pilot by [[Southern California Edison]] and found that revenues from the project were lower than project administration costs, eliminating its economic benefits.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2017 |title=Southern California Edison Company's Department of Defense Vehicle-to-Grid Final Report |url=http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=6442455793 |website=California Public Utilities Commission |access-date=2019-05-10  |archive-date=2021-02-27  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210227223431/https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/WorkArea/DownloadAsset.aspx?id=6442455793 |url-status=dead }}</ref><!-- this says a lot about this particular project, by SCE, in 2016.

=== Bidirectional DC-charging ===
EVs typically allow fast [[Charging station#AC to DC conversion|DC-charging]], with the transformer in a charging station connected directly to the vehicle battery. Technology is being developed for bidirectional DC-charging to and from the station, without needing extra hardware in the car, having the DC-to-AC converter in the station. In principle, EVs without hardware support for V2G could gain bidirectionality capability with only a software upgrade.<ref name=tdio20230123>{{cite news |url=https://thedriven.io/2023/01/23/world-first-trial-with-ccs-could-open-up-vehicle-to-everything-technology-to-all-evs/ |title=World first" trial with CCS could open up vehicle-to-everything technology to all EVs |first=Daniel |last=Bleakley |work=The Driven |location=Australia |date=2023-01-23 |access-date=2024-03-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ambibox.de/en/products/ambicharge |title=Bidirectional DC charging technology |publisher=ambicharge |location=Germany |access-date=2024-03-30}}</ref>

===Denmark===
The Edison Project intends to install enough turbines to accommodate 50% of Denmark's total power needs, while using V2G to protect the grid. The Edison Project plans to use PEVs while they are plugged into the grid to store additional wind energy that the grid cannot handle. During the hours of peak energy use, or when the wind is calm, the power stored in these PEVs will be fed into the grid. To aid in the acceptance of PEVs, zero emission vehicles received government subsidies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2022}}

Following the Edison project, the Nikola project was started<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nikola.droppages.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Nikola |access-date=2016-07-12}}</ref> which focused on demonstrating V2G technology in a laboratory setting at the Risø Campus of the [[Technical University of Denmark]] (DTU). DTU is a partner along with Nuvve and Nissan.

===United Kingdom===
Starting in January 2011, programs and strategies to assist in PEV adoption were implemented.

In 2018, [[EDF Energy]] announced a partnership with Nuvve, to install up to 1,500 V2G chargers.

===Australia ===

Since 2020, the [[Australian National University]]'s (ANU) Realising Electric Vehicle-to-grid Services (REVS) team has been studying the reliability and viability of V2G at scale,<ref>{{cite news |title=Electric vehicle fleets set to be on-call to backup the grid |newspaper=Anu |url=https://www.anu.edu.au/news/all-news/electric-vehicle-fleets-set-to-be-on-call-to-backup-the-grid |publisher=Australian National University |location=Canberra |date=8 July 2020 |access-date=30 November 2022}}</ref> spinning off the Battery Storage and Grid Integration Project<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bsgip.com |title=Battery Storage and Grid Integration Project |location=Canberra |access-date=30 November 2022}}</ref> initiative.

In 2022 the first V2G charger became available to purchase in Australia, but delays in rolling them out occurred due to regulatory processes, each State Power Authority needing to certify them as compliant (following Australian government approval). There has also been limited uptake due to high prices and very few EVs being approved to use V2G (at 2023, only the Nissan Leaf EV and some Mitsubishi hybrid EVs). This roll-out follows ANU researchers' production of a comprehensive review of international V2G projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://arena.gov.au/knowledge-bank/the-a-z-of-v2g/ |title=A to Z of V2G – A comprehensive analysis of vehicle-to-grid technology worldwide |publisher=Australian Renewable Energy Agency |first1=Laura |last1=Jones |first2=Kathryn |last2=Lucas-Healey |first3=Björn |last3=Sturmberg |first4=Hugo |last4=Temby |first5=Monirul |last5=Islam |date=January 2021 |access-date=3 January 2023}}</ref>{{Page needed|date=January 2023}}

The project used ten vehicle charging stations. Smart energy redistribution measures were controlled by software. The results showed that electromobility can be used to flexibly control renewable generation sources that vary with the climate.

===Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory===
[[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] developed V2G-Sim, a simulation platform used to model spatial and temporal driving and charging behavior of individual PEVs on the grid. Its models investigate the challenges and opportunities of V2G services, such as modulation of charging time and charging rate for peak [[demand response]] and [[utility frequency]] regulation. Preliminary findings indicated that controlled V2G service can provide peak-shaving and valley-filling services to balance daily electric load and mitigate the duck curve. Uncontrolled vehicle charging was shown to exacerbate the duck curve.<ref>{{cite news |title=Used EV Batteries Get New Life Powering the Grid |newspaper=Fleetcarma |date=14 December 2016 |url=https://www.fleetcarma.com/used-ev-batteries-power-grid/ |publisher=Fleetcarma.com |access-date=2017-10-06 }}</ref>

V2G-Sim reported that, assuming daily V2G service from 7pm to 9pm at a charging rate of 1.440&nbsp;kW over ten years, V2G would have minor battery degradation impacts on PEVs compared with cycling losses and calendar aging, incremental capacity losses being 2.68%, 2.66%, and 2.62% respectively.<ref>{{cite book |first1=Dai |last1=Wang |first2=Samveg |last2=Saxena |first3=Jonathan |last3=Coignard |first4=Elpiniki |last4=Iosifidou |first5=Xiaohong |last5=Guan |title=2016 IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting (PESGM) |chapter=Quantifying electric vehicle battery degradation from driving vs. V2G services |date=2016-07-21 |pages=1–5 |doi=10.1109/PESGM.2016.7741180 |isbn=978-1-5090-4168-8 |s2cid=434374 }}</ref>

The more a battery is used the sooner it needs replacing. As of 2016, replacement cost was approximately one-third of the cost of the car.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://electricvehicles.caa.ca/frequently-asked-questions/#q7 |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Canadian Automobile Association |work=Electric Vehicles |access-date=2016-03-08}}</ref>  Batteries degrade with use.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://na.industrial.panasonic.com/sites/default/pidsa/files/uf103450pn_1.pdf |title=Lithium Ion UF103450P |publisher=Panasonic |year=2012 |access-date=2016-03-08 |archive-date=2016-03-08  |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308131252/https://na.industrial.panasonic.com/sites/default/pidsa/files/uf103450pn_1.pdf |url-status=dead }}</ref> [[JB Straubel]], then chief technology officer of [[Tesla Inc.|Tesla Inc]], discounted V2G, claiming that battery wear outweighs economic benefit.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://cleantechnica.com/2016/08/22/vehicle-to-grid-used-ev-batteries-grid-storage/ |title=Why Vehicle-To-Grid & Used EV Battery Storage Isn't Logical |first=Zachary |last=Shahan |work=Clean Technica |date=2016-08-22 |access-date=2016-08-22}}</ref> A 2017 study found decreasing capacity,<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.greencarcongress.com/2017/05/20170515-v2g.html |title=Green Car Congress: Hawaii study finds vehicle-to-grid discharge detrimental to EV batteries|work=GreenCarCongress |date= 2017-05-15 |access-date= 2017-05-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dubarry | first1 = Matthieu | last2 = Devie | first2 = Arnaud | last3 = McKenzie | first3 = Katherine | year = 2017 | title = Durability and reliability of electric vehicle batteries under electric utility grid operations: Bidirectional charging impact analysis | journal = Journal of Power Sources | volume = 358 | pages = 39–49 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2017.05.015 | bibcode = 2017JPS...358...39D | doi-access = free }}</ref> and a 2012 hybrid-EV study found minor benefit.<ref>{{cite thesis |url=https://kilthub.cmu.edu/articles/Plug-in_hybrid_electric_vehicles_battery_degradation_grid_support_emissions_and_battery_size_tradeoffs/6721085 |title=Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles: battery degradation, grid support, emissions, and battery size tradeoffs |first=Scott B. |last=Peterson |publisher=Carnegie Mellon University |location=US |date=2012-01-05 |page=8}}</ref>

A 2015 study<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2015-12-01|title=A cost-benefit analysis of alternatively fueled buses with special considerations for V2G technology|journal=Energy Policy|volume=87|pages=591–603|doi=10.1016/j.enpol.2015.09.038|issn=0301-4215|last1=Shirazi|first1=Yosef|last2=Carr|first2=Edward|last3=Knapp|first3=Lauren|bibcode=2015EnPol..87..591S |s2cid=154598691 }}</ref> found that economic analyses favorable to V2G failed to include many&nbsp;of the less obvious costs associated with its implementation. When these less obvious costs were included, the study reported that V2G was an economically inefficient solution.

Another common criticism related to efficiency is that cycling power into and out of a battery, which includes "inverting" the DC power to AC, inevitably incurs energy losses. This cycle of [[Electrical efficiency|energy efficiency]] may be compared with the 70–80% efficiency of large-scale [[pumped-storage hydroelectricity]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Levine |first1=John |title=Pumped Hydroelectric Energy Storage and Spatial Diversity of Wind Resources as Methods of Improving Utilization of Renewable Energy Sources |url=http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/energystorage/files/MSThesis_JGLevine_final.pdf |publisher=Colorado University |location=US |access-date=2014-08-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140801113053/http://www.colorado.edu/engineering/energystorage/files/MSThesis_JGLevine_final.pdf |archive-date=2014-08-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

Power companies must be willing to adopt the technology in order to allow vehicles to give power to the power grid.<ref name="Uddin 342–347" /> For vehicles to power the grid cost-effectively, "smart meters" are essential.<ref name="Pillai" />
