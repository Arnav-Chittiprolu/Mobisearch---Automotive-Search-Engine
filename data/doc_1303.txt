Overview [ edit ] The Rivian R2 was revealed on March 7, 2024, alongside the smaller R3 , an entry-level compact SUV. The R2 is a two-row, five-passenger vehicle designed as a more compact and affordable alternative to the R1S in Rivian's SUV lineup. The proposed starting price of $45,000 is significantly less than the R1S, which starts at nearly $75,000. [ 1 ] The R2 is planned to be sold globally as Rivian's entry into the European market and the company's first model sold outside of the United States and Canada . [ 2 ] The R2 will be the first vehicle in Rivian's lineup to support the North American Charging System (NACS). At the R2’s unveiling, the charge port was originally located on the rear passenger’s side to accommodate street charging, which is more common in Europe. The charge port has since been moved to the rear driver’s side. [ 3 ] Specifications [ edit ] The Rivian R2 is expected to feature LG Energy Solution 4695 cylindrical cells, a newly developed battery format that offers greater energy density and improved thermal management compared to the 2170 cells used in the R1 models. [ 4 ] These cells are 46 mm in diameter and 95 mm in height, and supposedly provide over six times the energy capacity per cell. [ 5 ] The battery pack is projected to deliver a range of more than 300 miles (480 km) on a single charge, though Rivian has not yet disclosed the full range estimates for different configurations. [ 6 ] Rivian has confirmed that the R2 will be available in multiple powertrain configurations, including single-motor ( rear-wheel drive ), dual-motor ( all-wheel drive ), and tri-motor (all-wheel drive). [ 1 ] The R2 will use MacPherson struts in the front and multi-link suspension in the rear. References [ edit ] ^ a b Bell, Sebastien (March 7, 2024).
