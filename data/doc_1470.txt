Charging stations provide [[electrical connector|connector]]s that conform to a variety of international standards. DC charging stations are commonly equipped with multiple connectors to charge various vehicles that use competing standards.

Multiple standards have been established for charging technology to enable interoperability across vendors. Standards are available for nomenclature, power, and connectors. Tesla developed proprietary technology in these areas and began building its charging network in 2012.<ref name=":1" />

=== Nomenclature ===

Presented in silhouette format, with colors to distinguish between the five defined terms.|Charging station and vehicle terminology]]
In 2011, the [[European Automobile Manufacturers Association]] (ACEA) defined the following terms:<ref name="acea2011">{{cite web |url= https://www.acea.auto/files/charging_20110511.pdf |title=ACEA position and recommendations for the standardization of the charging of electrically chargeable vehicles|date=2 March 2011|publisher=ACEA&nbsp;– European Automobile Manufacturers Association |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121202043526/http://www.acea.be/images/uploads/files/charging_20110511.pdf |archive-date=2 December 2012 |url-status=live}}</ref>
* Socket outlet: the port on the electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) that supplies charging power to the vehicle
* Plug: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the socket outlet on the EVSE. The socket outlet and plug are not used in North America because the cable is permanently attached.
* Cable: a flexible bundle of conductors that connects the EVSE with the electric vehicle
* Connector: the end of the flexible cable that interfaces with the vehicle inlet
* Vehicle inlet: the port on the electric vehicle that receives charging power

The terms "electric vehicle connector" and "electric vehicle inlet" were previously defined in the same way under Article 625 of the United States [[National Electrical Code]] (NEC) of 1999. NEC-1999 also defined the term "electric vehicle supply equipment" as the entire unit "installed specifically for the purpose of delivering energy from the premises wiring to the electric vehicle", including "conductors ... electric vehicle connectors, attachment plugs, and all other fittings, devices, power outlets, or apparatuses".<ref>{{cite web |year=1999 |title=NEC 1999 Article 625 – Electric Vehicle Charging System |url=http://www.madkatz.com/ev/nec1999Article625.html |access-date=2 September 2021 |publisher=National Electrical Code}}</ref>

[[Tesla, Inc.]] uses the term ''charging station'' as the location of a group of chargers, and the term ''connector'' for an individual EVSE.<ref name=":0" />

The US National Electric Transportation Infrastructure Working Council (IWC) was formed in 1991 by the [[Electric Power Research Institute]] with members drawn from automotive manufacturers and the electric utilities to define standards in the US;<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.epri.com/pages/sa/infrastructure-working-council |title=Infrastructure Working Council |publisher=Electric Power Research Institute |access-date=2 September 2021}}</ref> early work by the IWC led to the definition of three levels of charging in the 1999 [[National Electrical Code]] (NEC) Handbook.<ref name=MA-EVCE/>{{rp|9}}

Under the 1999 NEC, Level 1 charging equipment (as defined in the NEC handbook but not in the code) was connected to the grid through a standard [[NEMA 5]]-20R 3-prong electrical outlet with grounding, and a [[ground-fault circuit interrupter]] was required within {{cvt|12|in|cm}} of the plug. The supply circuit required protection at 125% of the maximum rated current; for example, charging equipment rated at 16&nbsp;[[ampere]]s ("amps" or "A") continuous current required a breaker sized to 20&nbsp;A.<ref name=MA-EVCE/>{{rp|9}}

Level 2 charging equipment (as defined in the handbook) was permanently wired and fastened at a fixed location under NEC-1999. It also required grounding and ground-fault protection; in addition, it required an interlock to prevent vehicle startup during charging and a safety breakaway for the cable and connector. A 40&nbsp;A breaker (125% of continuous maximum supply current) was required to protect the branch circuit.<ref name=MA-EVCE/>{{rp|9}} For convenience and speedier charging, many early EVs preferred that owners and operators install Level 2 charging equipment, which was connected to the EV either through an inductive paddle ([[Magne Charge]]) or a conductive connector ([[Avcon]]).<ref name=MA-EVCE/>{{rp|10–11;18}}

Level 3 charging equipment used an off-vehicle [[rectifier]] to convert the input AC power to DC, which was then supplied to the vehicle. At the time it was written, the 1999 NEC handbook anticipated that Level 3 charging equipment would require utilities to upgrade their distribution systems and transformers.<ref name=MA-EVCE/>{{rp|9}}

The Society of Automotive Engineers ([[SAE International]]) defines the general physical, electrical, communication, and performance requirements for EV charging systems used in North America, as part of standard [[SAE J1772]], initially developed in 2001.<ref name="freewiretech20200701">{{Cite web|date=1 July 2020|title=What's the Difference Between EV Charging Levels?|url= https://freewiretech.com/difference-between-ev-charging-levels/|access-date=26 March 2021 |work=FreeWire Technologies|language=en-US}}</ref> SAE J1772 defines four levels of charging, two levels each for AC and DC supplies; the differences between levels are based upon the power distribution type, standards and maximum power.

===== Alternating current (AC) =====
AC charging stations connect the vehicle's onboard charging circuitry directly to the AC supply.<ref name="freewiretech20200701" />

* '''AC Level 1''': Connects directly to a standard 120{{nbsp}}V North American outlet; capable of supplying 6{{ndash}}16{{nbsp}}A (0.7{{ndash}}1.92{{nbsp}}kilowatts or "kW") depending on the capacity of a dedicated circuit.
* '''AC Level 2''': Uses 240{{nbsp}}V (single phase) or 208{{nbsp}}V (three phase) power to supply between 6 and 80{{nbsp}}A (1.4{{ndash}}19.2{{nbsp}}kW). It provides a significant charging speed increase over AC Level 1 charging.

===== Direct current (DC) =====
Commonly, though incorrectly, called "Level 3" charging based on the older NEC-1999 definition, DC charging is categorized separately in the SAE standard. In DC fast-charging, grid AC power is passed through an AC-to-DC converter in the station before reaching the vehicle's battery, bypassing any AC-to-DC converter on board the vehicle.<ref name="freewiretech20200701" /><ref>{{cite web|title=What is Fast Charging |website=chademo.com |publisher=CHAdeMO Association |url= https://www.chademo.com/about-us/what-is-fast-charging/ |access-date=29 November 2017}}</ref>

* '''DC Level 1''': Supplies a maximum of 80{{nbsp}}kW at 50{{ndash}}1000{{nbsp}}V.
* '''DC Level 2''': Supplies a maximum of 400{{nbsp}}kW at 50{{ndash}}1000{{nbsp}}V.

Additional standards released by SAE for charging include [[SAE J3068]] (three-phase AC charging, using the [[Type 2 connector]] defined in [[IEC 62196]]-2) and [[SAE J3105]] (automated connection of DC charging devices).

==== IEC ====
In 2003, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) adopted a majority of the [[SAE J1772]] standard under IEC 62196-1 for international implementation.

The IEC alternatively defines charging in ''modes'' ([[IEC 61851]]-1):
* ''Mode 1'': slow charging from a regular electrical socket (single- or [[three-phase]] AC)
* ''Mode 2'': slow charging from a regular AC socket but with some EV-specific protection arrangement (i.e. the [[Park & Charge]] or the PARVE systems)
* ''Mode 3'': slow or fast AC charging using a specific EV multi-pin socket with control and protection functions (i.e. [[SAE J1772]] and [[IEC 62196]]-2)
* ''Mode 4'': DC [[#Charging time|fast charging]] using a specific charging interface (i.e. [[IEC 62196]]-3, such as [[CHAdeMO]])

The connection between the electric grid and "charger" (electric vehicle supply equipment) is defined by three cases (IEC 61851-1):

* ''Case A:'' any charger connected to the [[Mains electricity|mains]] (the mains supply cable is usually attached to the charger) usually associated with modes 1 or 2.
* ''Case B:'' an on-board vehicle charger with a mains supply cable that can be detached from both the supply and the vehicle – usually mode 3.
* ''Case C:'' DC dedicated charging station. The mains supply cable may be permanently attached to the charge station as in mode 4.

==== Tesla NACS ====
{{Main|North American Charging System}}

The North American Charging System (NACS) was developed by [[Tesla, Inc.]] for use in the company's vehicles. It remained a proprietary standard until 2022 when its specifications were published by Tesla.<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 November 2022 |title=Opening the North American Charging Standard |url= https://www.tesla.com/blog/opening-north-american-charging-standard |access-date=12 November 2022 |website=tesla.com |language=en-us}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Valdes-Dapena |first=Peter |date=2022-11-11 |title=Tesla officially makes its charging standard available to other companies |url= https://www.cnn.com/2022/11/11/business/tesla-opening-charger-network/index.html |access-date=2023-02-12 |work=CNN}}</ref> The connector is physically smaller than the J1772/CCS connector, and uses the same pins for both AC and DC charging functionality.

==== Development for higher power charging ====
An extension to the CCS DC fast-charging standard for electric cars and light trucks was being developed as of 2020, which was slated to provide higher power charging for large commercial vehicles ([[Truck classification|Class 8, and possibly 6 and 7 as well]], including school and transit buses). When the [[Combined Charging System|Charging Interface Initiative e. V.]] (CharIN) task force was formed in March 2018, the new standard being developed was originally called High Power Charging (HPC) for Commercial Vehicles (HPCCV),<ref name=HPCCV-2020-04>{{cite web |url= https://efiling.energy.ca.gov/GetDocument.aspx?tn=233844&DocumentContentId=66619 |title=CharIN HPCCV Task Force: High Power Plug Update [PDF] |date=April 2020 |publisher=CharIN |access-date=24 August 2021}}</ref> later renamed [[Megawatt Charging System]] (MCS). MCS is expected to operate in the range of 200{{ndash}}1500{{nbsp}}V and 0{{ndash}}3000{{nbsp}}A for a theoretical maximum power of 4.5{{nbsp}}megawatts (MW). The proposal calls for MCS charge ports to be compatible with existing CCS and HPC chargers.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://insideevs.com/news/372749/charin-hpccv-over-2-mw-power/ |title=CharIN Develops Super Powerful Charger With Over 2 MW Of Power |website=insideevs.com}}</ref> The task force released aggregated requirements in February 2019, which called for maximum limits of 1000{{nbsp}}V DC (optionally, 1500{{nbsp}}V DC) and 3000{{nbsp}}A continuous rating.<ref>{{cite report |url= https://www.charinev.org/fileadmin/HPCCV/High_Power_Commercial_Vehicle_Charging_Requirements_v2.0.pdf |title=CharIN High Power Commercial Vehicle Charging Task Force Aggregated Requirements |date=18 February 2019 |publisher=CharIN |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190710213141/https://www.charinev.org/fileadmin/HPCCV/High_Power_Commercial_Vehicle_Charging_Requirements_v2.0.pdf |archive-date=10 July 2019 |url-status=dead}}</ref>{{update after|2025|8|7}}

'''Quick Notes on EV Charger types'''
; Notes
{{notelist}}

CCS DC charging requires [[power-line communication]] (PLC). Two connectors are added at the bottom of Type 1 or Type 2 vehicle inlets and charging plugs to supply DC current. These are commonly known as Combo 1 or Combo 2 connectors. The choice of style inlets is normally standardized on a per-country basis so that public chargers do not need to fit cables with both variants. Generally, North America uses Combo 1 style vehicle inlets, while most of the rest of the world uses Combo 2.

The [[CHAdeMO]] standard is favored by [[Nissan]], [[Mitsubishi]], and [[Toyota]], while the [[SAE J1772]] Combo standard is backed by [[General Motors|GM]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[Volkswagen]], [[BMW]], and [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]]. Both systems charge to 80% in approximately 20 minutes, but the two systems are incompatible. Richard Martin, editorial director for clean technology marketing and consultant firm Navigant Research, stated:

<blockquote>The broader conflict between the CHAdeMO and SAE Combo connectors, we see that as a hindrance to the market over the next several years that needs to be worked out.<ref name="Julia">{{cite web|last=Pyper|first=Juliet|date=2013-07-24|title=Charger standards fight confuses electric vehicle buyers, puts car company investments at risk|url=https://www.eenews.net/stories/1059984950|access-date=2013-07-29|work=ClimateWire |publisher=E&E Publishing}}</ref></blockquote>

In the United States, many of the EVs first marketed in the late 1990s and early 2000s such as the [[GM EV1]], [[Ford Ranger EV]], and [[Chevrolet S-10 EV]] preferred the use of Level 2 (single-phase AC) EVSE, as defined under NEC-1999, to maintain acceptable charging speed. These EVSEs were fitted with either an inductive connector ([[Magne Charge]]) or a conductive connector (generally [[AVCON]]). Proponents of the inductive system were GM, Nissan, and Toyota; DaimlerChrysler, Ford, and Honda backed the conductive system.<ref name=MA-EVCE/>{{rp|10–11}}

Magne Charge paddles were available in two different sizes: an older, larger paddle (used for the EV1 and S-10 EV) and a newer, smaller paddle (used for the first-generation [[Toyota RAV4 EV]], but backwards compatible with large-paddle vehicles through an adapter).<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.magnecharge.com:80/mainweb/newsachive1.htm |title=News Archive 1 |publisher=Magne Charge |date=December 2000 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20010302150306/http://www.magnecharge.com:80/mainweb/newsachive1.htm |archive-date=2 March 2001 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The larger paddle (introduced in 1994) was required to accommodate a liquid-cooled vehicle inlet charge port; the smaller paddle (introduced in 2000) interfaced with an air-cooled inlet instead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.magnecharge.com:80/mainweb/newsachive2.htm |title=News Archive 2 |publisher=Magne Charge |date=December 2000 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20010302150413/http://www.magnecharge.com:80/mainweb/newsachive2.htm |archive-date=2 March 2001 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=CARB-ISOR-2001/>{{rp|23}} SAE J1773, which described the technical requirements for inductive paddle coupling, was first issued in January 1995, with another revision issued in November 1999.<ref name=CARB-ISOR-2001/>{{rp|26}}
