R1S Specs/Updates [ edit ] Hi User:Tergy . I see that in early June you started a page for the Rivian R1S but couldn’t find much information to fill out the page. Below is some information from recent press coverage in several media publications that might help. I am an employee of Rivian and therefore can’t make the edits myself. I tried following the same specs outline as the R1T to provide the info, and have formatted the sources. I hope this is helpful. Best IanRivian ( talk ) 21:13, 29 July 2022 (UTC) [ reply ] Thanks.

Refs in Lead [ edit ] The lead is rarely referenced, it comes from information in the text which itself is referenced. Check out some other articles. I personally think it reads easier. Similar for the infobox, although I think there are often good reasons for refs there.
