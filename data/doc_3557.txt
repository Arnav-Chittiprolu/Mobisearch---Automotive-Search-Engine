The Porsche Cayenne is a series of automobiles manufactured by the German company Porsche since 2002. It is a luxury crossover SUV , and has been described as both a full-sized and a mid-sized vehicle. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The first generation was known within Porsche as the Type 9PA (955/957) or E1. It was the first V8-engined vehicle built by Porsche since 1995, when the Porsche 928 was discontinued. It is also Porsche's first off-road variant vehicle since its Super and Junior tractors of the 1950s, as well as the first production Porsche with four doors. Since 2014, the Cayenne has been sold alongside a smaller Porsche SUV, the Macan . The second-generation Cayenne (Type 92A or E2) was unveiled at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show in March. The Cayenne shares its platform, body frame, doors, and electronics with the Volkswagen Touareg and Audi Q7 , and to some extent with the Lamborghini Urus and Bentley Bentayga. It received a facelift in 2014 with minor external changes, and introduced a new plug-in E-Hybrid version with its public launch at the Paris Motor Show . [ 7 ] Since 2008, all engines have featured direct injection technology. The third generation (Type 9YA or E3) was unveiled in 2017 in the German city of Stuttgart .

[ 10 ] The lineup initially consisted of the V8-powered Cayenne S and Cayenne Turbo. Later in the model cycle, VR6 and diesel-powered versions joined the lineup. In the eight model years of the E1 generation, a total of 276,652 units were produced. [ 11 ] The name Cayenne was coined by Manfred Gotta . The base model Cayenne is powered by a 3.2-L VR6 engine producing 250 PS (184 kW; 247 hp). The intake manifold is unique to Porsche, but otherwise the engine is largely the same as the VW engine. Acceleration from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) is 9.1 seconds with the manual transmission and 9.7 seconds with the Tiptronic S. Rear view (Face-lifted 9PA Cayenne Turbo) E1 Cayenne Interior 9PA Porsche Cayenne GTS Design Edition 3 Rear view 9PA Cayenne GTS Cayenne S [ edit ] The S in the 955 pre-facelift 9PA is powered by a 4.5L V8 engine with a wet-sump lubrication system and variable valve timing. It produces 335 hp (250 kW; 340 PS) and 310 lb⋅ft (420 N⋅m) of torque. Acceleration from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) takes 6.9 seconds and the top speed is 150 mph (241 km/h). [ 12 ] Introduced only for 2006 (as a pre-GTS concept), the Cayenne S Titanium Edition was a one-year exclusive, limited production SUV featuring a lightweight steel body, featuring an aluminium hood (lighter than the one equipped on the Cayenne S), titanium-painted accented body parts, side lower rocker body panels, Sport-Quad Tip Exhaust chrome tailpipes, 19" titanium painted alloy wheels, bi-xenon headlights, two-tone interior upholstery, Porsche PCM 2.0 w/ trip computer navigation, MP3 audio and Bose cabin surround sound. Under the hood, improvements included sport-tuned suspension, an aerodynamic body package, low-range transfer case, locking differential and a 6-speed automatic Tiptronic S transmission. The Cayenne S Titanium Edition is powered by the same 4.5L V8 engine that powered the Cayenne S - still producing 335 hp (250 kW; 340 PS) and 310 lb⋅ft (420 N⋅m) of torque. Acceleration is quicker than the regular Cayenne S from 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) at 6.2 seconds and the top speed is 150 mph (241 km/h). In the updated 9PA chassis 957 Cayenne S introduced between 2008 and 2010, it featured a direct fuel injection (DFI) 4.8L V8 engine which produces 385 PS (283 kW; 380 hp) and 500 N⋅m (370 lb⋅ft) of torque. It had a 0–100 km/h (62 mph) time of 6.6 seconds with a top speed of 250 km/h. The updated V8 engine featured VarioCam Plus which combine variable valve timing with two-stage valve lift on the inlet side. Cayenne GTS [ edit ] The E1 Gran-Turismo Sport (GTS) was only offered in the updated 9PA chassis between the year 2008 and 2010. It was the first Porsche of the modern era to feature the GTS abbreviation nameplate in its model designation. Its sporty chassis had been specially developed only for this model variant and it was powered with a performance tuned 405 PS (298 kW; 399 hp) 4.8 L V8. It also featured a lowered sport suspension, sports exhaust system and 21-inch (533 mm) high performance wheels as standard. It was much lighter than a normal Cayenne and had an aerodynamic wide body kit standard from factory. The Porsche Cayenne GTS had a 0–100 km/h (62 mph) time of 6.1 seconds with a top speed of 253 km/h. A six-speed manual transmission was also offered in the GTS. [ 13 ] Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S [ edit ] Pre-facelift 955 Cayenne Turbo The first-generation 9PA Cayenne Turbo had 450 PS (331 kW), and can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 5.6 seconds. [ 12 ] A Turbo S version was built in 2006 to compete with the Mercedes-Benz ML 63 AMG. The Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S include a low-range case, a locking differential, and height-adjustable, off-road suspension. The Turbo S is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.5 L V8 that produces 521 PS (383 kW; 514 hp) and 720 N⋅m (530 lb⋅ft) of torque; Acceleration from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) takes 5.0 seconds and the top speed is 167 mph (269 km/h); It features a six-speed automatic Tiptronic S transmission. Facelifted 957 Cayenne Turbo In 2008 an updated 9PA Turbo model, featuring a larger direct fuel injection 4.8-L V8 engine, was revealed at the Beijing Auto Show . It produces 500 PS (368 kW; 493 hp), and can accelerate from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 4.9 seconds. [ 14 ] Also revealed with the new Turbo, was a new 550 hp (410 kW) Turbo S model. Acceleration from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) for that car takes 4.7 seconds and it can be had with optional ceramic composite brakes. Cayenne Diesel [ edit ] The original Cayenne Diesel was only available in the facelift 9PA chassis, powered by a 3.0-L V6 VW TDI engine, since February 2009. [ 15 ] The engine is rated at 240 PS (177 kW; 237 hp) and 550 N⋅m (410 lb⋅ft) of torque. The car was unveiled at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show . [ 16 ] The diesel can accelerate from 0–60 mph (97 km/h) in 8.2 seconds. Cayenne S Transsyberia [ edit ] A Cayenne S Transsyberia at the Goodwood Festival of Speed in 2009 The Cayenne S Transsyberia was originally a racing vehicle designed for the Transsyberia rally , in which only 285 were built. [ 17 ] The street version was later built to commemorate Porsche's victory in the Transsyberia rally. It is only available in the 9PA chassis with the 405 hp (302 kW) direct-inject 4.8-L V8 from the Cayenne GTS. Sales began in January 2009, with a targeted production run of 600 road vehicles worldwide (285 for North America), but far fewer were actually built (102 for USA, 17 for Canada including 3 which were 6 speed manual). [ 18 ] Cayenne GTS Porsche Design Edition 3 (2010) [ edit ] In May 2009, [ 19 ] a limited edition version based on the Cayenne GTS was introduced, designed by Porsche Design Studio and included a Porsche Design chronograph Type P'6612. Production was limited to 1000 units worldwide. [ 20 ] Cayenne Concepts [ edit ] In April 2022, [ 21 ] Porsche unveiled a concept open-top Cayenne for the first time to the public as a part of the 20th anniversary of the Porsche Cayenne. The Cayenne was proving successful, so in December 2002 Porsche designers wanted to assess the viability of more Cayenne body styles. They came up 3 alternate body shapes: a coupe style SUV, a convertible SUV and a longer wheelbase 3 row SUV. Porsche designers decided to continue with the idea of a convertible SUV, creating a two-door, non-drivable (due to a lack of strengthening added to the chassis to prevent the car from buckling without a fixed roof) convertible Cayenne that had two alternate designs on the rear. Additionally, its doors were 20 cm longer than the standard Cayenne and it had a shorter A-Pillar than the standard model. Due to the concerns surrounding head room, boot space and rear design the idea was scrapped. However, the coupe style SUV lead to the modern Cayenne Coupe. Moreover, the idea of a longer wheelbase 3 row SUV likely led to the large Porsche SUV which is currently in the prototype stages. [ 22 ] Engines [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources .

In preparation for the unveiling, the Cayenne production facility in Leipzig, Germany, closed in December 2009 to commence factory retooling for the new model, a process that took two to three months. [ citation needed ] Porsche Cayenne (Germany; pre-facelift) The 92A Porsche Cayenne was slightly larger than its predecessors, but featured a more slanted rear window, less upright windshield, a more sloping roofline, door-mounted mirrors, smaller windows at the rear of the vehicle, headlights inspired by the Carrera GT , taillights that extend onto the car's tailgate, LED daytime running lights and a vastly redesigned interior much like the Panamera . [ 25 ] The 2011 Cayenne is almost 250 kg (551 lb) lighter than the previous models due to removing the low-range transfer case making it slightly more fuel efficient than the previous lineup. More use of aluminium and magnesium also helped shave weight. [ 26 ] Despite its lower stance, the new vehicle's off-road capabilities have been retained without compromising the street performance-oriented layout and design. In addition to a diesel offering, a hybrid version is available. [ 27 ] Model year 2013–2016 diesel Porsche Cayennes are included in the Volkswagen emissions scandal . Standard features of the 92A Porsche Cayenne included automatic air conditioning with dual-zone climate controls, interior air filter, tilt/telescopic leather-wrapped steering wheel with radio controls, cruise control, leather upholstery, eight-way power front seats, outside-temperature indicator, and universal garage door opener in the base model. The Cayenne S adds a power sunroof and memory for the driver's seat. [ 26 ] The Cayenne GTS added an optional rearview camera, keyless access and start, and memory system. Finally, the most upscale Cayenne Turbo and Turbo S added a navigation system with voice recognition, optional four-zone climate controls, heated rear seats, premium sound system with six-disc CD changer. [ 28 ] The E2 Cayenne was powered by a 3.6-L VR6 engine producing 300 PS (221 kW; 296 hp), the Cayenne S features the same 4.8-L V8 in the Panamera S models producing 400 PS (294 kW; 395 hp) and the Cayenne Turbo comes with Panamera Turbo's 4.8 L twin turbo V8 producing 500 PS (368 kW; 493 hp). [ 26 ] The Cayenne S Hybrid uses an Audi-sourced 3.0-L V6 engine producing 333 PS (245 kW; 328 hp), paired with a nickel metal hydride battery capable of 47 PS (35 kW; 46 hp), for a total of 380 PS (279 kW; 375 hp). [ 29 ] A six-speed manual gearbox serves as the standard transmission system on the base Cayenne to 2014, with all other models featuring an eight-speed automatic (Tiptronic S) as standard equipment. The low-range transfer case found in the previous generation has been removed. All vehicles will feature about 10% less weight than their predecessors, 70 kg worth of standard equipment in excess of that found on the current model and a more heavily contoured rear bench. Available Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control ( PDCC ) active anti-roll bars , [ 30 ] Adaptive air suspension and Porsche Active Suspension Management (PASM). In September 2012 Porsche announced the Cayenne S Diesel. [ 31 ] This model is fitted with the Audi 4.2 V8 TDI engine. In October 2012, Porsche confirmed the addition of a new Cayenne Turbo S. [ 32 ] In July 2014, Porsche launched a facelifted Cayenne range, with minor exterior alterations and new power-train options, including a plug-in E-Hybrid and downsizing of the S model's 4.8-L V8 to a turbocharged 3.6-L V6. Porsche Cayenne V6 Diesel (UK; facelift) Porsche Cayenne V6 Diesel (UK; facelift) Hybrid [ edit ] Porsche Cayenne hybrid drivetrain At the IAA 2005 , Porsche announced it would produce a hybrid version of the Cayenne before 2010 (Porsche Cayenne Hybrid). [ 33 ] Two years later, at the IAA 2007 , Porsche presented a functioning Cayenne Hybrid and demonstration model of the drivetrain. [ 34 ] Notable modifications to this car include an electric vacuum pump and hydraulic steering pump, allowing the car to function even when the engine is deactivated. A 288-volt nickel metal hydride battery is placed under the boot floor, occupying the space normally used for a spare tire. [ 35 ] The production version, called the 'S' Hybrid, was launched in 2010, with a 3.0-L petrol V6 linked with an electric motor to achieve CO 2 emissions of 193 g/km. [ 36 ] The S Hybrid was launched in the U.S. market in November 2010. [ 37 ] Plug-in hybrid [ edit ] Porsche Cayenne S E-Hybrid charging port In July 2014, Porsche announced the launch of the Porsche Cayenne S E-Hybrid, a plug-in hybrid with an all-electric range between 18 and 36 km (11 and 22 mi) under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC) standard. The plug-in model displaced the Cayenne S Hybrid from the line up, and it is part of the revised range. The Cayenne S E-Hybrid is the first plug-in hybrid in the premium SUV segment, allowing Porsche to become the first automaker with three production plug-in hybrid models. [ 38 ] Deliveries in Germany were scheduled to begin in October 2014. [ 39 ] Sales in the U.S. began in November 2014.

The Cayenne towed a 265-ton Air France Airbus A380 to a distance of 42 meters, breaking the previous 2013 record of a Nissan Patrol towing a 170-ton Ilyushin Il-76 to a distance of 50 meters. [ 42 ] After the attempt Porsche repeated the test using a petrol-powered Cayenne Turbo S with 800 Nm of torque , 50 Nm less than the S Diesel, in an effort to prove the Cayenne's remarkable ability. [ 43 ] Third generation (E3 9YA/9YB; 2017) [ edit ] Motor vehicle Third generation (9YA/9YB) 2018 Cayenne Turbo Overview Production August 2017 – present [ 44 ] Model years 2019–present [ 44 ] Assembly Slovakia: Bratislava ( Volkswagen Bratislava Plant ) [ 45 ] Malaysia: Kulim, Kedah ( Sime Darby : 2022–present, for 3.0-litre only) Designer Ingo Scheinhutte [ 46 ] under Michael Mauer Body and chassis Body style 5-door SUV (9Y0) 5-door coupé SUV (9Y3 Coupe) Platform Volkswagen Group MLB Evo Related Volkswagen Touareg Mk3 Audi Q7 Mk2 Audi Q8 Bentley Bentayga Lamborghini Urus Powertrain Engine Petrol : 2.9 L EA839TT V6 twin-turbo 3.0 L EA839T V6 turbo 4.0 L EA825TT V8 twin-turbo Petrol plug-in hybrid : 3.0 L EA839 V6 turbo 4.0 L EA825 V8 twin-turbo Electric motor 100 kW (136 PS; 134 hp) integrated electric motor (E-Hybrid) Transmission 8-speed ZF 8HP automatic (Tiptronic S) Battery 14.1 kWh lithium-ion (2018–2020) 17.9 kWh lithium-ion (2021–2022) 25.9 kWh lithium-ion (2023–present) Dimensions Wheelbase 2,895 mm (114.0 in) Length 4,918–4,929 mm (193.6–194.1 in) 4,931–4,942 mm (194.1–194.6 in) (Coupé) Width 1,983–1,995 mm (78.1–78.5 in) Height 1,673–1,696 mm (65.9–66.8 in) 1,636–1,676 mm (64.4–66.0 in) (Coupé) Curb weight 2,083–2,643 kg (4,592–5,827 lb) The third-generation Porsche Cayenne was revealed on August 29, 2017, set to be put on sale in 2019. It is built on the Volkswagen Group MLB platform shared with several other luxury crossover SUVs produced by Volkswagen Group, including the Volkswagen Touareg , Audi Q7 , Audi Q8 , Bentley Bentayga , and Lamborghini Urus . [ 47 ] For this generation, the Cayenne no longer shares the door design with the Volkswagen Touareg. According to Stephan Lenschow, the Cayenne body product manager, this allows Porsche to give the Cayenne a more ' coke bottle ' design. The Cayenne also received a redesigned front end with larger air intakes, more prominent creases along the bonnet, and a lower roofline to align its styling with the Porsche 911 . [ 48 ] The wheelbase remains unchanged from the previous generation, but Porsche increased the Cayenne's overall length slightly by about 63 mm (2.5 in). The height is slightly lowered by 9 mm (0.4 in) and the coefficient of drag is rated at 0.35. [ 49 ] Despite a small increase in length, the third-generation Cayenne is lighter by around 65 kg (143 lb), depending on the configuration, due to the use of a lighter chassis. Aluminium is used extensively throughout the vehicle, including in the doors, roof, hood, rear hatch, as well as its body in white . The ratio of aluminium to high-strength steel is roughly 50-50, according to Lenschow. A lighter lithium-ion polymer starter battery that saves 10 kg (22 lb) also contributes to its weight distribution , which in base configuration is nearly balanced with approximately 55 percent front and 45 percent rear. All engine options of the third-generation Cayenne are turbocharged, while diesel engines are no longer offered. [ 47 ] All Cayenne models in this generation are equipped with an updated eight-speed " Tiptronic S" transmission that is claimed to provide quicker shifts than before. Porsche offers optional Porsche Surface Coated Brakes (PSCB), which consist of a cast-iron disc with 70 micrometers of tungsten-carbide coating. According to Karl Heess, Porsche director for product line SUV, PSCB reduce brake dust by as much as 50 percent over conventional iron brake discs), and extend the life of the disc by up to 35 percent. It is more expensive than iron discs while still being 50 percent less expensive than the ceramic brake option. Other innovations in this generation include staggered (different width) front and rear tires, and optional rear-axle steering to reduce the turning radius. [ 48 ] In the first quarter of 2022, Porsche sales declined by 5%, but the Cayenne remained the manufacturer's best-selling car. [ 50 ] Rear (Cayenne Turbo) Interior (Cayenne S) Cayenne Coupé [ edit ] A model with a more rakish roofline dubbed the Cayenne Coupé became available in 2019. It was revealed during the Shanghai Auto Show in April 2019. At launch, there were two sub-models, the Cayenne Coupé and Cayenne Turbo Coupé. The Cayenne Coupé is extensively reworked from the standard model, featuring a shallower front windshield and narrower A-pillar . The roof is lowered by 20 mm (0.8 in), while new rear door panels and updated fenders extended the vehicle width by 18 mm (0.7 in). The drag coefficient is rated at 0.34, which is 0.1 lower than the regular model. [ 51 ] Every Cayenne Coupé is equipped with standard 2.16 m 2 (23.3 sq ft) fixed-glass panoramic roof, while an optional contoured carbon roof is also available as an option. [ 52 ] Cayenne Turbo Coupé Rear view Variants [ edit ] At its introduction in August 2017, Porsche released two versions of the third-generation Cayenne, which are base and Cayenne S. [ 53 ] The Cayenne Turbo was released a month later. The Cayenne S used the EA839 2.9-litre twin turbo V6 engine, with larger brake rotors and calipers compared with the base model. Cayenne Turbo [ edit ] In September 2017, Porsche added the Cayenne Turbo to the line-up. Introduced at the Frankfurt Motor Show , the Cayenne Turbo is powered with a twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V8 rated at 549 PS (404 kW; 541 hp) and 770 N⋅m (78.5 kg⋅m; 568 lb⋅ft) of torque. Porsche claimed a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) acceleration figure of 4.1 seconds, or 3.9 seconds with the Sport Chrono package, and a top speed of 285 km/h (177 mph). Porsche Surface Coated Brakes (PSCB) are standard equipment. [ 54 ] Cayenne E-Hybrid [ edit ] In May 2018, Porsche introduced the Cayenne E-Hybrid. Sharing the same plug-in hybrid system with the Panamera 4 E-Hybrid, the variant uses a 3.0-litre V6 petrol engine with an eight-speed Tiptronic S automatic gearbox rated at 462 PS (340 kW; 456 hp) and 700 N⋅m (71.4 kg⋅m; 516 lb⋅ft) of torque. Porsche claims a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) time of 5.0 seconds and top speed of 252 km/h (157 mph). The all-electric range is rated by Porsche at 43 km (27 mi). It takes 7.8 hours to fully charge the 14.1 kWh battery with a 230-volt connection, or 2.3 hours if an optional 7.2 kW on-board charger is fitted. [ 55 ] Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid [ edit ] In August 2019, the Cayenne Turbo S E-Hybrid was released for both regular and Coupé body styles. A plug-in hybrid model, it uses a twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V8 petrol engine rated at 550 PS (405 kW; 542 hp) and a 136 PS (100 kW; 134 hp) electric motor for a combined total of 680 PS (500 kW; 671 hp) and 900 N⋅m (664 lb⋅ft) of torque. A 14.1-kWh lithium-ion battery is used, and was said to offer 30 percent more capacity than the battery used in previous generation plug-in hybrid Cayenne models. Charging time is quoted at 2.4 hours when connected to a 240-volt, 50-amp source. Porsche claimed a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) acceleration figure of 3.6 seconds with a top speed of 295 km/h (183 mph). Porsche Ceramic Composite Brakes (PCCB), Porsche Dynamic Chassis Control (PDCC), Porsche Torque Vectoring Plus (PTV+), and Sport Chrono Package are standard equipment for the model. [ 56 ] Cayenne GTS [ edit ] In June 2020, Porsche introduced the Cayenne GTS and Cayenne GTS Coupé for the 2021 model year, after a two-year hiatus. It is powered by a twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V8 shared with the Panamera GTS, which is rated at 460 PS (338 kW; 454 hp) and 620 N⋅m (63.2 kg⋅m; 457 lb⋅ft) of torque. The new models are capable of reaching 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.8 seconds or 4.5 seconds using Performance Start, which is included in the optional Sport Chrono Package (standard on Coupé). Sport Design package, 21-inch RS Spyder Design wheels, and Sport Exhaust are included as standard equipment. [ 57 ] Cayenne GTS Rear view Cayenne Turbo GT [ edit ] Cayenne Turbo GT In June 2021, Porsche introduced the Cayenne Turbo GT version. Based on the Cayenne Coupé, it uses a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 engine which Porsche claims to produce 640 PS (471 kW; 631 hp) and claimed 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) acceleration time in 3.3 seconds. It is equipped with 22-inch wheels with Pirelli P Zero Corsa tyres. Ride height is lowered by 18 mm (0.7 in), while overall vehicle height is 30 mm (1.2 in) lower. [ 58 ] 2023 facelift [ edit ] In April 2023, the Cayenne was given a mid-cycle refresh for the 2024 model year. Notable changes include a new dashboard layout, similar to that of the Taycan, a fully digital 12.6-inch gauge cluster, and minor exterior restyling modifications for the hood, headlights, bumpers, fenders, and trunk. Matrix LED headlamps became standard equipment across the range, while HD Matrix LED units are optional. The HD Matrix LED features two high-definition modules and more than 32 000 pixels per headlamp, and the pixel accuracy of the headlamp units enables the selective blocking out of parts of the high beam. The powertrains were also upgraded, with the base 3.0-litre V6 engine power output increasing by 10 kW (13 hp) and 50 N⋅m (37 lbf⋅ft) of torque to produce 260 kW (349 hp) and 500 N⋅m (369 lbf⋅ft). The Cayenne S gained a V8 engine which it lost since the release of the third-generation Cayenne. It is a 4.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine that produces 350 kW (469 hp) and 600 N⋅m (443 lbf⋅ft) of torque, representing an increase of output of 25 kW (34 hp) and 50 N⋅m (37 lbf⋅ft) over the previous Cayenne S that is powered by a 2.9 dm 3 twin-turbocharged petrol V6. [ 59 ] The electric motor from the E-Hybrid plug-in hybrid variant was increased from 100 to 130 kW (134 to 174 hp), and the battery increased to 93 MJ (26 kWh), up from 64.5 MJ (17.9 kWh) previously, offering a pure electric driving range of up to 90 km on the WLTP test cycle. [ 60 ] Revisions to the chassis for this refreshed model included revised dampers with two-valve technology for separate compression and rebound sections, which Porsche claimed will help offer a wider range of performance between ride comfort and handling.

Orders started immediately. [ 64 ] A fourth-generation internal combustion engine Cayenne has not been confirmed, though Porsche has announced that they will introduce another upgrade to the third-generation model, which is technically unrelated. [ 65 ] Rear (Cayenne Electric Prototype) lt comes with a 14.25-inch OLED instrument display and a curved central 12.25-inch OLED infotainment screen known as the "flow display", with support for Android Auto or Apple CarPlay . It is supplemented by an optional 14.9-inch passenger display and an optional augmented 3D heads-up display. It has a functionally integrated 113 kWh battery pack (108 kWh net) composed of six modules bolted to the chassis. Energy density increases by ~7% over the Taycan sedan. Each module hosts four packs, with eight pouch cells connected in series. The pack can charge at up to 400 kW, going from 10 to 80 percent in as few as 16 minutes. It supports both NACS and J1772 chargers. It offers 11 kW inductive home charging . [ 66 ] The cooling system uses 15% less energy, and the predictive thermal management system conditions the battery during driving and charging. Curb weight is in excess of 5,500 lbs (2.5 tonnes). [ 66 ] The dual-motor Turbo model will boast more torque and power output than any other regular-series production Porsche, with over 804 hp (600 kW) with 10-second surge power over 938 hp (700 kW) and launch control, at 1,072 hp (800 kW). The motor directly cools the stator with non-conductive oil and uses silicon carbide inverters, achieving motor efficiency to 98 percent. Regenerative braking can reach 600 kW, supporting over 0.5 Gs of deceleration.

This includes the failure of the centre drive shaft carrier bearing. Cayenne engines using Lokasil or Alusil engine blocks, with exception of the VW-based VR6 six-cylinder engine which has a cast iron block, can suffer from cylinder bore scoring as well. [ 68 ] Early V8 Cayenne models came equipped with plastic coolant pipes that would crack and fail, possibly causing the engine to overheat. Subsequent Cayenne S and Turbo engines were fitted with upgraded aluminum coolant pipes to rectify this issue. 92A Cayenne models except Hybrid and V6 Diesel suffer with transfer case problems, and Porsche issued a 10-year warranty on pre-facelift 92A (2011–2014) and a 7-year warranty on post-facelift 92A (2015–2018) models, both with unlimited mileage.
