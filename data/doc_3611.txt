From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Protective cover for automobiles Front-end bra A Geo Storm with a front-end bra Inventor Bill Colgan Inception 1961 Manufacturer Colgan Custom Manufacturing Covercraft 1991 BMW 318i (E30) with a hood bra A front-end bra (also known as a car bra , bonnet bra , front-end cover , hood bra , auto bra , [ 1 ] hood mask , car mask , etc.) is a (usually black) vinyl cover that attaches to the front of a car or other vehicle to protect the bumper , hood , and sides of the fenders from scratches . The inside of the bra is lined with a felt -like material. [ 2 ] History [ edit ] Bill Colgan, founder of Colgan Custom Manufacturing, Inc. successfully operated a trim and upholstery business in Burbank, California , for fifteen years prior to creating the car bra. The front-end bra was invented in 1961 when three German engineers from Lockheed commissioned Colgan for protective covers for their Porsches . The very first pattern was for the Porsche 356 , the first order for which was for 12 units. Following a subsequent order of 150 covers, Colgan paused car cover production in order to concentrate on his main business. By the mid-1970s, Colgan's comfortable position in the upholstery business allowed him to resume car cover production, having given a name to his invention: the "Original Car Bra ." [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The popularity of the front-end bra peaked in the 1980s and 1990s in the United States. [ citation needed ] Oklahoma -based Covercraft acquired Colgan Custom Manufacturing in 2009. [ citation needed ] Design [ edit ] There are several types of front-end bras, including "full", "sport", and "T-style". "Sport" car bras cover less of the front of the vehicle than "full" bras. The "T-style" bra is generally intended for trucks and SUVs. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Front-end bras can also be carbon-based, ostensibly to absorb the microwaves used in police radar equipment and thus minimize the risk of detection when speeding. [ 1 ] [ 7 ] Front-end bras are most commonly black, but may be available in other colors to match the color of the vehicle. "Clear" front-end bras exist in the form of a transparent protective film that can extend from the front end over the entire car body. [ citation needed ] Along with dazzle camouflage , automakers may use larger bras together with cloth covers to conceal the design of an entire vehicle (or certain parts of it) during development and road testing .
