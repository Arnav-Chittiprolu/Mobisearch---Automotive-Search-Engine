Devices measuring displacement are based on displacement sensors , which can be contacting or non-contacting. [ 1 ] Some displacement sensors are based on displacement transducers , [ 2 ] devices which convert displacement into another form of energy. [ 3 ] Displacement sensors can be used to indirectly measure a number of other quantities, including deformation , distortion, thermal expansion , thickness (normally through the combination of two sensors), vibration , spindle motion, fluid level, strain and mechanical shock . [ 1 ] Displacement sensors exist that can measure displacement on the order of nanometers or smaller. [ 1 ] Application [ edit ] Displacement receivers can be used to study and observe the stress waves passing through a material after it is struck. [ 4 ] This can be used, for example, to assess fire damage in reinforced concrete . [ 4 ] Displacement transducers are often used to measure vibration. [ 5 ] Types [ edit ] Optical displacement sensors exist, using reflected light to determine distance. [ 6 ] An ultrasonic displacement sensor is a kind of displacement sensor. [ 6 ] These measure the distance to targets by emitting high-frequency sound waves and measuring the time they take to return. [ 6 ] Displacement sensors can be made using linear variable differential transformers . [ 6 ] Strain gauges can be used as the base for small displacement transducers on the order of 0 to 10 mm. [ 7 ] In music, certain music keyboards can be considered to measure displacement in the sense that they respond to displacement, rather than velocity (as is more commonly the case). [ citation needed ] Examples of displacement-responding sensors include the mechanical action of tracker organs , as well as the force-sensing resistors found in music keyboards that had polyphonic aftertouch capability.  Polyphonic aftertouch is no longer a feature of presently manufactured keyboards, but certain older models such as the Roland A50 featured a pressure sensing resistor, similar in principle-of-operation to a carbon microphone, in each key.
