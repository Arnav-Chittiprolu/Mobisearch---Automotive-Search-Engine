As of December 2013, Estonia was the only country that had completed the deployment of an [[Electric vehicle network|EV charging network]] with nationwide coverage, with 165 fast chargers available along highways at a maximum distance of between {{convert|40|-|60|km|abbr=on}}, and a higher density in urban areas.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/e9cb7536-f5f1-11e2-a55d-00144feabdc0.html?siteedition=intl|title=Infrastructure: Shortage of electric points puts the brake on sales |first=Adam |last=Palin|work=Financial Times|date=19 November 2013|access-date=28 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://estonianworld.com/technology/estonia-becomes-the-first-in-the-world-to-open-a-nationwide-electric-vehicle-fast-charging-network/|title=Estonia becomes the first in the world to open a nationwide electric vehicle fast-charging network |author=KredEx |publisher=Estonian World |date=20 February 2013 |access-date=28 December 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/feb/20/estonia-electric-car-charging-network |title=Estonia launches national electric car charging network |first=Adam |last=Vaughan |work=The Guardian |date=20 February 2013|access-date=28 December 2013}}</ref>

As of November 2012, about 15,000 charging stations had been installed in Europe.<ref>{{cite press release|url= http://www.greencarcongress.com/2012/12/zoe-20121217.html |title=Renault delivers first ZOE EV |author=Renault |publisher=Green Car Congress|date=17 December 2012|access-date=17 December 2012}}</ref> As of March 2013, Norway had 4,029 charging points and 127 DC fast-charging stations.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.gronnbil.no/elbiluniverset/kart.php#zoom=4&tr=67.05180773239154,52.137835449218755&bl=46.53128773022859,-34.873883300781245&m=2&reg=0|title=Ladepunkter i Norge|trans-title=Charge Points in Norway|publisher=Grønn bil|access-date=10 April 2013 |language=no |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120426023024/http://www.gronnbil.no/elbiluniverset/kart.php#zoom=4&tr=67.05180773239154,52.137835449218755&bl=46.53128773022859,-34.873883300781245&m=2&reg=0|archive-date=26 April 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref> As part of its commitment to environmental sustainability, the Dutch government initiated a plan to establish over 200 fast ([[direct current|DC]]) charging stations across the country by 2015. The rollout will be undertaken by [[ABB]] and Dutch startup [[Fastned]], aiming to provide at least one station every {{cvt|50|km|mi}} for the Netherlands' 16 million residents.<ref>{{cite web|title=Every Dutch citizen will live within 31 miles of an electric vehicle charging station by 2015|url= https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/10/4509962/netherlands-nationwide-electric-vehicle-charging-network-abb-fastned |work=The Verge |access-date=11 July 2013 |first=Amar |last=Toor |date=10 July 2013}}</ref> In addition to that, the E-laad foundation installed about 3000 public (slow) charge points since 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ondersteuning laadinfrastructuur elektrische auto's wordt voortgezet |url= http://www.e-laad.nl/nieuws/ondersteuning-laadinfrastructuur-elektrische-autos-wordt-voortgezet/ |website=e-laad.nl |language=nl |access-date=26 May 2014|date=21 January 2014}}</ref>

Compared to other markets, such as China, the European electric car market has developed slowly. This, together with the lack of charging stations, has reduced the number of electric models available in Europe.<ref name="euroIB20210714">{{cite web|title=The future of e-mobility is now |url= https://www.eib.org/en/stories/electric-transport|access-date=14 July 2021 |work=European Investment Bank |language=en}}</ref> In 2018 and 2019 the [[European Investment Bank|European Investment Bank (EIB)]] signed several projects with companies like Allego, Greenway, BeCharge and Enel X. The EIB loans will support the deployment of the charging station infrastructure with a total of €200&nbsp;million.<ref name="euroIB20210714" /> The UK government declared that it will ban the selling of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035 for a complete shift towards electric charging vehicles.<ref>{{cite news |title=Petrol and diesel car sales ban brought forward to 2035 |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-51366123 |access-date=6 March 2022 |publisher=BBC}}</ref> Edit summary (Briefly describe your changes) By publishing changes, you agree to the Terms of Use , and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and the GFDL .
