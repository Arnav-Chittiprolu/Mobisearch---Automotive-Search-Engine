From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia "SOx" redirects here. For other uses, see Sox . Sulfur oxides (SOx) are a group of chemical compounds composed of sulfur and oxygen . The most common sulfur oxides are sulfur dioxide ( SO 2 ) and sulfur trioxide ( SO 3 ). Sulfur oxides are produced naturally through volcanic activity and are also released into the atmosphere from human activities like burning fossil fuels and industrial processes. Lower sulfur oxides ( S n O , S 7 O 2 and S 6 O 2 ) Sulfur monoxide ( SO ) and its dimer, disulfur dioxide (S 2 O 2 ) Sulfur dioxide ( SO 2 ) Sulfur trioxide ( SO 3 ) Higher sulfur oxides ( SO 3 , SO 4 , and polymeric condensates of them) Disulfur monoxide ( S 2 O ) Index of chemical compounds with the same name This set index article lists chemical compounds articles associated with the same name.
