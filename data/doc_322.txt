It has been marketed across four generations as a front-engine, front-wheel drive , five-passenger, five-door hatchback , with a three-door hatchback offered for the second generation, as well as a saloon version for the fourth. As the brand's entry-level vehicle, the first generation A-Class, internally coded W168, was introduced in 1997, the second generation (W169) in late 2004 and the third generation (W176) in 2012. The fourth generation model (W177), which was launched in 2018, marked the first time the A-Class was offered in the United States and Canada. [ 1 ] This fourth generation A-Class is also the first to be offered both as a hatchback (W177) and sedan (V177). [ 2 ] Styled by Steve Mattin and launched at the 1997 Frankfurt Motor Show , the A-Class was noted for its short, narrow footprint, its overall height, and an interior volume and level of equipment competing with larger cars. The A-Class subsequently gained length and width over its successive generations, losing some of its height. Approximately 3.3 million A-Class models had been manufactured by the 2021 model year.

[ 4 ] The A-Class was presented to the motoring press late in 1996, and launched at the Frankfurt Motor Show in the autumn of 1997, the W168 A-Class was quite unusual for Mercedes-Benz featuring a front-wheel drive layout and unusual tall but yet short body and Avantgarde at the 1999 Geneva Motor Show and 1999 Frankfurt Motor Show. This was the first complete exterior designed by Coventry University trained Steve Mattin , for which he was named Autocar magazine's 'Designer of the Year'. Earlier, Mattin had mostly worked on design for the W210 E-Class in 1991. Concurrent to the W168, he designed the exterior of the W220 S-Class. The final design freeze occurred in January 1995, at 32 months before August 1997 start of production. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Between 1997 and 2004, 1.1 million first generation A-Class models had been sold. [ 7 ] Overall, Daimler lost €1,440 per vehicle produced. [ 8 ] The A-Class was facelifted in February 2001, with minor alterations to the headlights, front and rear bumper design and the addition of a new 170 mm (6.7 in) longer wheelbase version. It was launched at the Geneva Motor Show . [ 9 ] Moose Test Issue/Recall [ edit ] The W168 became infamous in 1997 after flipping over during the traditional " moose test " [ 10 ] performed by the Swedish automobile publication Teknikens Värld . According to the report, the W168 overturned when manoeuvring to avoid the "moose". Mercedes initially denied the problem, but then took the surprising step of recalling all units sold to date (2,600) and suspending sales for three months until the problem was solved by adding electronic stability control and modifying the suspension. [ 11 ] The company spent DM 2.5 billion in developing the car, with a further DM 300 million to fix it. [ 12 ] Engines [ edit ] All A-Class models are powered by four-cylinder engines, with 1.4 L and 1.6 L petrol models at launch ( M 166 series ), followed by two versions of a 1.7 L diesel engine (OM 668 series). In 1999, a larger 1.9 L petrol model was added, with the 2.1 the last W168 version to be launched in 2002. Also two AMG versions were produced, a 3.2 in 2001 and a 3.8 in 2000, though very few of these were made.

A further 600 people work in the office building at the plant site. Mercedes-Benz began W168 production on 17 February 1999 at its new Brazilian facility in Juiz de Fora , Minas Gerais . The Brazilian plant was the company's first factory in South America dedicated to passenger cars, with an investment of US$840 million and 10,000 employees. The factory initially produced A-Class and C-Class models, assembling them from pieces manufactured in Germany. The target for the cars was regional markets (from Argentina to Mexico) with modifications made to the cars to suit local conditions, like a protection for the motor base. By May 2004 production stopped in Rastatt plant. In September 2005 Brazilian Juiz de Fora factory stopped production of A-Class cars. [ 16 ] A210 EVOLUTION [ edit ] AMG originally considered a highly dynamic, supercharged flagship for the first-generation A-Class, but ultimately chose a more balanced concept that met the demands for comfort, everyday usability, and reliability. The result was the A210 EVOLUTION, derived from the A190 and offered exclusively in silver or black. As only the second Mercedes model to bear the “EVOLUTION” name and limited to 2,629 units, it is a rare and distinctly sporty-luxurious variant. It combined an enlarged M166 engine with extensive equipment—including leather/Alcantara upholstery, an AMG-style body kit, sports suspension, stainless-steel pedals, wide tyres, exclusive 17-inch wheels, and a unique dual-exit stainless-steel exhaust. Available in both short and long versions, the A210 EVOLUTION paired enhanced driving dynamics with the A-Class’s flexible interior concept, while many of its components could also be ordered individually and the Designo programme offered additional high-end customisation options. Mercedes-Benz A-Class "F-Cell" (2004–) [ edit ] Mercedes-Benz A-Class F-Cell concept See also: Mercedes-Benz F-Cell It is a version of 5-door A-Class hydrogen fuel cell vehicle with 88 PS (65 kW; 87 hp) electric motor. It has a driving range of 160 km (99 mi). [ 17 ] Three A-Class F-Cell cars were used in the 2003 Frankfurt International Motor Show for press shuttle service. On 18 June 2004, 4 production F-Cell vehicles were delivered to Deutsche Telekom and BEWAG/Vattenfall Europe in Berlin. [ 18 ] In 2007, the A-Class F-Cell were delivered to Landsvirkjun and Reykjavik Energy. [ 19 ] A DHL version of F-Cell was unveiled in FC EXPO 2008. [ 20 ] Reception [ edit ] According to a 2008 British customer satisfaction survey by Which? , the A-Class with manufacture years between 1998 and 2004 came third from bottom out of 217 models surveyed with a score of 65 percent. [ 21 ] Second generation (W169; 2004) [ edit ] "W169" redirects here. For the isotope of tungsten (W-169 or 169 W), see Tungsten-169 .

Standard equipment included front as well as combined head and thorax-protection side airbags. The front airbags are adaptive with two-stage gas generators operating according to the severity of accident. Optionally rear side airbags (for side-impacts in the backseats) and side-curtain airbags were available. The force exerted by the seat belt system during a collision adapts dynamically to collision characteristics. The 'active' head restraints (standard for driver and front passenger) reduce neck injury, especially in rear collisions. The cargo capacity of the W169 was increased by 15 percent over the W168. Seven four-cylinder engines were available: four petrol (gasoline) (A 150, A 170, A 200, A 200 Turbo) and three diesel (A 160 CDI, A 180 CDI, A 200 CDI) partnered with either five- or six-speed manual gearbox . A continuously variable transmission system called "Autotronic Constantly Variable Transmission" (CVT) is an optional feature. The petrol A 200 Turbo provides 193 hp (144 kW) and 280 N⋅m (207 lb⋅ft) of torque (rotational force); the diesel A 200 CDI has 140 hp (104 kW) and 300 N⋅m (221 lb⋅ft). The most powerful engine achieved 0-100 km/h (62 mph) in 8.0 seconds with a top speed of 218 km/h (135 mph).
The newly developed direct-injection CDI diesel units use a common-rail direct injection system that improves fuel consumption and reduces exhaust emissions and engine noise . All the engines meet the tight EU4 emissions limits. A particulate filter system is available as an option for the diesel units to reduce particulate emissions by about 99% without the need for additives. The A-Class is a front wheel drive car and features traction control (ASR) as standard, as well as electronic stability control and anti-lock brakes (ABS). Handling is improved by precision tracking and anti-roll support, and by a Parabolic Rear Axle. A "Selective Damping System", in which the shock absorber forces respond differently according to conditions, is standard. For example, under normal conditions it operates at soft absorption; while cornering at speed it changes to full damping force. Sales of the W169 were targeted at 50,000 units in 2004. Dr. Joachim Schmidt, Executive Vice President Sales and Marketing, Mercedes Car Group, said that target had been reached even before vehicles arrived in dealer showrooms. [ citation needed ] Japan models went on sale in 2005-02-04. Early models include 5-door right drive versions of A 170, A 170 Elegance, A 200 Elegance. [ 23 ] 5-door right drive version of A 200 TURBO Elegance was added in 2005-11-10. [ 24 ] Due to the body width being larger than 1700 mm, it could not be registered as small car in Japan. (See Vehicle size class#Japan ) 2008 update [ edit ] Pre-facelift interior The W169 Model facelift changes included redesigned front and rear fascias and lights, and optional stop-start function on A 150 and 170 models. [ 25 ] Active Park Assist enables the car to parallel park itself, with only throttle and brake inputs required from the driver. The five-door Hatchback and the three-door Coupé vehicles debuted in spring 2008, alongside the refreshed 2009 M-Class and B-Class.

[ 30 ] Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-CELL (2010) [ edit ] The Mercedes-Benz A-Class E-CELL was introduced in September 2010 and debuted at the October 2010 Paris Motor Show . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] The E-Cell has a range of 200 kilometres (120 mi) capable of developing a peak output of 70 kW (94 hp), a continuous power rating of 50 kW (67 hp) and a maximum torque of 290 N·m (214 lb·ft). The Mercedes A-Class E-Cell can accelerate from 0–60 km/h (37 mph) in 5.5 seconds, and its top speed is 150 km/h (93 mph). [ 31 ] [ 33 ] Tesla Motors , as part of its collaboration with Mercedes-Benz , built electric powertrain components for the E-Cell. The 36 kWh battery contains approximately 4,000 individual lithium-ion cells . [ 31 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Mercedes has developed a modular system for electric vehicles with battery and fuel-cell. This system allows the efficient use of shared parts in all the brand's electric vehicles . Thanks to the modular approach the electric drive of the A‑Class E‑Cell is also used in the B‑Class F‑Cell , and the energy storage units in the A‑Class EV are the same as the battery in the Smart fortwo electric drive . [ 31 ] [ 33 ] A limited production of 500 A-Class E-Cell electric cars will be built, for trial purposes, at the Mercedes Rastatt plant, near Stuttgart beginning in September 2010. As part of a demonstration program, the cars will be leased to selected customers in several European countries, including Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Daimler is not planning to sell the electric version outside Europe. [ 31 ] [ 33 ] [ 36 ] A 180 Final Edition (2012) [ edit ] The Final Edition is a limited (300 units) version of 5-door righthand drive A 180 for the Japanese market.
