In 1994, Volkswagen unveiled the [[J Mays]]-designed [[Volkswagen New Beetle#History|Concept One]], a "retro"-themed [[concept car]] with a resemblance to the original Beetle, based on the platform of the Polo. Due to a positive response to the concept, a production version was developed as the [[Volkswagen New Beetle|New Beetle]], based on the Golf's larger platform.<ref name="ltvvwc-2003">{{cite web|title=The VW Experimental Vehicles – the 1980s to present pt 2|url=http://www.ltv-vwc.org.uk/wheelspin/WS_feb_2003/WnW-prototypes04.htm|work=Wheelspin|publisher=London & Thames Valley VW Club|access-date=12 July 2010|date=February 2003|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614094520/http://www.ltv-vwc.org.uk/wheelspin/WS_feb_2003/WnW-prototypes04.htm|archive-date=14 June 2011}}</ref>

In 1995 the [[Volkswagen Sharan|Sharan]] was launched in Europe, the result of a joint venture with [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], which also resulted in the [[Ford Galaxy]] and [[SEAT Alhambra]].<ref>{{cite web|title=VW Sharan|url=http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Drives/Search-Results/First-drives/VW-Sharan-2011-CAR-review/|website=Car Magazine|access-date=4 January 2015|date=2 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104171105/http://www.carmagazine.co.uk/Drives/Search-Results/First-drives/VW-Sharan-2011-CAR-review/|archive-date=4 January 2015}}</ref>

The company's evolution of its model range was continued with the [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4|Golf Mk4]], introduced at the end of 1997 (North America in 1999), its chassis spawned a host of other cars within the Volkswagen Group; the [[Volkswagen Bora]] (the sedan known as the Jetta in the United States), SEAT Toledo, SEAT León, [[Audi A3]], [[Audi TT]], and [[Škoda Octavia]]. Other main models during the decade include the [[Volkswagen Polo|Polo]], a smaller car than the Golf, and the larger [[Volkswagen Passat|Passat]] for the segment above the Golf.

In 1998 the company launched the new [[Volkswagen Lupo|Lupo]] city car. In 1999 they announced the first "3-litre" car, a lightweight version of the Lupo that could travel 100&nbsp;km with only 3-liters of diesel—making it the world's most fuel efficient car at the time.<ref>{{cite web|title=VW launches its economic miracle|url=http://www.theengineer.co.uk/news/vw-launches-its-economic-miracle/285981.article|website=The Engineer|access-date=4 January 2015|date=5 January 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104162606/http://www.theengineer.co.uk/news/vw-launches-its-economic-miracle/285981.article|archive-date=4 January 2015}}</ref> Edit summary (Briefly describe your changes) By publishing changes, you agree to the Terms of Use , and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and the GFDL .
