From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Compact sedan Motor vehicle BYD Qin BYD Qin Plus DM-i Overview Manufacturer BYD Auto Production 2012–present Body and chassis Class Compact car / small family car ( C ) Mid-size car ( D ) Body style 4-door sedan Chronology Predecessor BYD F3DM The BYD Qin ( Chinese : 比亚迪秦 , after the Qin dynasty ) is a series of compact and mid-size sedans produced by BYD Auto since 2012. The Qin started out as the plug-in hybrid version of the BYD Surui , and was introduced in the Chinese market in August 2012. [ 1 ] Currently, the Qin is available as a plug-in hybrid (PHEV), battery electric vehicle (BEV), and previously an internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle. The Qin is the successor of the BYD F3DM , the world's first mass-produced PHEV automobile which launched in China in 2008. In April 2012, BYD replaced the F3DM with the Qin. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The first-generation Qin is the PHEV version of the BYD Surui (the second-generation BYD F3 ), and deliveries in China began in December 2013. [ 5 ] The second generation model includes two variants was released in September 2018 as the BYD Qin Pro , which was available as an ICE vehicle, PHEV and BEV. [ 6 ] In 2021, this model was updated and renamed to BYD Qin Plus with PHEV and BEV variants. An updated version of the first generation is sold alongside the second generation Qin variants. In 2024, BYD released a larger, mid-size Qin variant marketed as the BYD Qin L DM-i , which is solely equipped with the DM-i 5.0 PHEV powertrain. In 2025, a battery electric counterpart was introduced as the BYD Qin L EV .

It was named after the Qin dynasty , China's first imperial dynasty. [ 8 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] The plug-in hybrid variant (which was the only variant available in the beginning) currently offers a NEDC all-electric range of 82 km (51 mi) [ 12 ] and a hybrid electric powertrain that can extend the car's total range to a distance similar to that of a conventional petrol-powered vehicle. The all-electric variant offers a NEDC range of 520 kilometres (320 mi). [ 13 ] The Qin was designed with BYD's next-generation, more efficient, dual-mode, electric powertrain. The BYD Qin uses a smaller lithium iron phosphate battery (LiFePO 4 , or LFP) than its predecessor, the F3DM: 13 kWh instead of 16 kWh. The LiFePO 4 battery has a high energy density, can withstand up to 4,000 charges and still retain 80 percent performance, and uses no toxic heavy metals in its manufacture. Due to its improved design, the new battery is about 50 percent smaller and lighter than the one used on the F3DM. The reduced battery pack size translates into reduced price at the expense of the all-electric range , which BYD estimates at 50 kilometres (31 mi). The larger battery in the F3DM delivers an all-electric range of 97 kilometres (60 mi). BYD said the Qin would be seven percent more efficient with savings in power and energy in all-electric (EV) mode. [ 8 ] [ 10 ] In hybrid mode, the Qin uses two 110-kilowatt (148 hp; 150 PS) electric motors and a 1.5-litre turbo-charged direct-injected engine, instead of the 1.0-litre 3-cylinder engine used in the F3DM, to output 223 kW (299 hp; 303 PS) of power and 440 N⋅m (325 lb⋅ft; 45 kg⋅m) of torque. According to BYD Auto, the Qin has a top speed of 185 km/h (115 mph) and can accelerate from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in less than 5.9 seconds. Thanks to its smaller battery and increased wheelbase, the Qin will have more interior space than the F3DM, and the styling has also been improved over BYD's earlier models, most notably in the car's interior. [ 8 ] [ 10 ] Retail sales of the BYD Qin began in Costa Rica in November 2013, and BYD planned to start sales in other countries in Central and South America in 2014.

Qin EV300 [ edit ] A pure battery electric version, the Qin EV300, was released in China in March 2016. [ 16 ] The BYD Qin EV300 is powered by a 218 hp electric motor and a battery pack that is expected to deliver a range of 300 km (190 mi). Top speed is 150 kilometres per hour (93 mph). [ 17 ] There are four versions of the Qin EV300. [ 11 ] BYD Qin EV300 2019 refresh [ edit ] Despite the introduction of the Qin Pro in 2018, an updated version of the first-generation Qin is also in production as of 2019. The manufacturer refers to it as the "all-new Qin" (全新秦). The new model uses the "dragon face" styling of the front end, with some changes to the taillights. The vehicle is shorter than the initial model (4,675 mm (184.1 in) vs 4,740 mm (186.6 in)), while the wheelbase and the width remain same. While the initial model was offered as a plug-in hybrid or with an all-electric drivetrain, the updated model is offered with a petrol engine or with an all-electric drivetrain. In the all-electric variant, the battery capacity is 53.1 kWh (191 MJ).

High-strength steel comprises 73.5% of the weight of the car's body in white (in the petrol variant). [ 23 ] [ 24 ] Rear view Powertrain [ edit ] BYD offered three different powertrains for the Qin Pro, including battery electric, plug-in hybrid, and as a conventional gasoline ICE vehicle. The plug-in hybrid Qin Pro DM is powered by a 154 hp (115 kW; 156 PS) 1.5-litre turbo, inline four engine combined with a 150 hp (112 kW; 152 PS) electric motor to produce a total of 304 hp (227 kW; 308 PS). The top speed of the Qin Pro DM is 200 km/h (124 mph) and can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 5.9 seconds. [ 25 ] The battery electric Qin Pro EV features a 69.5 kWh battery in the top version. [ 13 ] Qin Plus (2021) [ edit ] For 2021, BYD introduced the Qin Plus ( Chinese : 秦PLUS ) as the refreshed version of the Qin Pro. The Qin Plus was unveiled during the 2020 Guangzhou Auto Show in November 2020, and went on sale in March 2021. Compared to the Qin Pro, it features restyled front and rear ends, while dimensions are unchanged. It is available as a plug-in hybrid DM-i variant and battery electric version (EV). [ 26 ] BYD started selling a sister model of the Qin Plus DM-i, the Destroyer 05 in March 2022. It is based on the Qin Plus with the same powertrain, with redesigned front and rear fascias and dashboard. While the Qin Plus is sold through Dynasty Network dealerships, the Destroyer 05 is part of the Ocean Network dealership line-up. [ 27 ] Qin Plus DM-i [ edit ] The Qin Plus DM-i was launched in January 2021 and went on sale in March 2021 in China. It is one of the first BYD products with its updated plug-in hybrid system, the DM-i, alongside the Tang DM-i and Song Plus DM-i crossovers. [ 28 ] [ 20 ] In February 2023, BYD introduced the Qin Plus DM-i Champion Edition with a reduced price. [ 29 ] In February 2024, BYD reduced the price of the vehicle further by introducing the Qin Plus DM-i Honor Edition. The company remarked that it is "officially opening a new era of electricity (vehicle) is lower than oil (petrol-powered vehicle)." [ 30 ] From February 2024, BYD started selling the Qin Plus DM-i in some Middle East markets such as the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia and Qatar as the Qin Plus PHEV.
