It is the fourth-most-populous city in Australia , with a population of over 2.3 million within Greater Perth as of 2023 [update] . The world's most isolated major city by certain criteria, Perth is part of the South West Land Division of Western Australia, with most of Perth's metropolitan area on the Swan Coastal Plain between the Indian Ocean and the Darling Scarp . The city has expanded outward from the original British settlements on the Swan River , upon which its central business district and port of Fremantle are situated. Perth was founded by Captain James Stirling in 1829 as the administrative centre of the Swan River Colony . The city is situated on the traditional lands of the Whadjuk Noongar people, where Aboriginal Australians have lived for at least 48,000 years. Perth was named after the city of Perth in Scotland . [ 7 ] Initially established as a free settlement, the colony accepted transported convicts from 1850 to supply labour for public works and construction. Perth was proclaimed as a city by Queen Victoria in 1856. [ 8 ] Substantial population growth occurred during the late 19th-century Western Australian gold rushes , and the city has continued to expand, particularly after World War II due to a high net migration rate . Post-war immigrants were predominantly from the British Isles and Southern Europe, while more recent arrivals see a growing population of Asian descent. During the late 20th and early 21st centuries, a series of mining booms in various regions of Western Australia propelled Perth into the role of the regional headquarters for significant mining operations . It became Australia's fourth-most populated city in 1984, overtaking Adelaide . [ 9 ] Ranked as one of the world's most liveable cities , Perth was classified by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network as a Beta global city in 2020. As of 2021, [update] Perth is divided into 30 local government areas , comprising over 350 suburbs . The metropolitan contours span 125 kilometres (78 mi) from Two Rocks in the north to Singleton in the south, and 45 kilometres (28 mi) from the west coast to Sawyers Valley in the east. Beyond the central business district, predominant urban centres within the metropolitan area include Armadale , Fremantle , Joondalup , Midland and Rockingham . Most of those were originally established as separate settlements and retained a distinct identity after being subsumed into the wider metropolitan area. Mandurah , Western Australia's second-largest city, forms a conurbation with Perth along the coastline. Despite this, it is generally regarded as an independent city. Perth is home to many parkland areas and nature reserves, the most-visited being Kings Park and Botanic Garden , one of the world's largest inner-city parks. Other popular natural features include Cottesloe Beach and Rottnest Island . Notable heritage buildings and cultural sites include Perth Mint , WA Museum Boola Bardip and the World Heritage-listed Fremantle Prison . All five of Western Australia's universities are based in Perth. The city is served by Fremantle Harbour and Perth Airport . Toponymy [ edit ] The name of the city is taken from Perth, Scotland , in honour of the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies , and Member for Perthshire in the British House of Commons , Sir George Murray . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Murray's association with the city was included in Stirling's proclamation of the colony, read in Fremantle on 18 June 1829, which concluded with the statement, "Given under my hand and Seal at Perth this 18th Day of June 1829. James Stirling Lieutenant Governor". [ 12 ] The only contemporary information on the source of the name comes from Charles Fremantle 's diary entry for 12 August 1829, which records that they "named the town Perth according to the wishes of Sir George Murray". [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The Noongar name Boorloo is sometimes used to denote the central business district area, [ 15 ] [ 16 ] the local government area , [ 17 ] or the capital city in general. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] The name Boorloo was initially recorded by Robert Menli Lyon as Boorlo in 1833, [ 21 ] which was interpreted as "Perth, properly Point Fraser" (a location in East Perth ). He also gave the name Byerbrup for "the highland stretching along from Mount Eliza through the centre of the town of Perth". [ 22 ] In 1947, Ludwig Glauert posited that Lyon may have misunderstood his sources and that "boorloo" or "belo" (now transcribed as "bilya") is simply the Noongar word for "river". [ 23 ] Another source has interpreted Boorloo to mean "big swamp", [ 24 ] describing the chain of lakes where the central business district and Northbridge are situated. [ 25 ] In November 2024, when announcing the opening of Boorloo Bridge , the premier of Western Australia , Roger Cook , and two of his ministers, deputy premier Rita Saffioti and John Carey , referenced "the Noongar name for Perth – Boorloo", [ 26 ] and earlier in the year the Government of Western Australia stated "the name, Boorloo Bidee Mia, represents 'Perth pathway to housing' in Whadjuk Noongar language". [ 27 ] History [ edit ] Main article: History of Perth, Western Australia Prehistory [ edit ] Perth is located on the traditional land of the Whadjuk people , one of several groups in south-western Western Australia that make up the Noongar people. Archaeological evidence attests to human habitation in the Perth area for at least 48,000 years; [ 28 ] : 9 according to Noongar tradition, they have occupied the area since "time immemorial". [ 29 ] Noongar country encompasses the south-west corner of Western Australia, with particular significance attached to the wetlands on the Swan Coastal Plain , both spiritually (featuring in local mythology ) and as a source of food. [ 30 ] The current central business district location is within the traditional territory of the Mooro , a Noongar clan, led by Yellagonga at the time of the British settlement. The Mooro was one of several Noongar clans based around the Swan River, known collectively as the Whadjuk . The Whadjuk themselves were one of a larger group of fourteen tribes that formed the south-west socio-linguistic block known as the Noongar (meaning 'the people' in their language ), also sometimes called the Bibbulmun. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] On 19 September 2006, the Federal Court of Australia ruled in the case of Bennell v State of Western Australia [2006] FCA 1243 that Noongar native title persisted over Perth metropolitan area. [ 34 ] An appeal was subsequently filed, and in 2008, the Full Court of the Federal Court upheld parts of the appeal by the Western Australian and Commonwealth governments. [ 35 ] Following this appeal, the Western Australian Government and the South West Aboriginal Land and Sea Council negotiated the South West Native Title Settlement. This settlement, including the Whadjuk Indigenous Land Use Agreement over the Perth region, was finalised by the Federal Court on 1 December 2021. [ 36 ] As part of this agreement, the Noongar (Koorah, Nitja, Boordahwan) (Past, Present, Future) Recognition Act was passed in 2016, officially recognising the Noongar people as the traditional owners of the south-west region of Western Australia. [ 37 ] European exploration [ edit ] Willem de Vlamingh 's ships and black swans at the entrance to the Swan River, 1697 On 10 January 1697, Dutch Captain Willem de Vlamingh conducted the first documented exploration of the present-day Perth region. His crew initially explored the area on foot, leading them to what is now central Perth. [ 38 ] Vlamingh's expedition also ventured far up the Swan River, in search of native inhabitants. [ 39 ] They named the river Swarte Swaene-Revier , a reference to the black swans prevalent in the region. [ 39 ] After Vlamingh's expedition, other Europeans conducted further voyages of exploration in the period between 1697 and 1829. However, as with Vlamingh's assessments, they judged the area inhospitable and unsuitable for the agriculture necessary to sustain a European-style settlement. [ 40 ] Swan River Colony [ edit ] Main article: Swan River Colony Despite the Colony of New South Wales establishing a convict-supported settlement at King George's Sound (called Frederick Town , renamed to Albany upon becoming part of Western Australia) on the south coast of the continent in 1826, responding to rumours of potential French annexation, Perth marked the first comprehensive European settlement in the western portion of the continent in 1829. Officially designated as Western Australia in 1832, the colony retained the informal moniker "Swan River Colony" for many years, after the area's major watercourse. [ 41 ] The Foundation of Perth 1829 by George Pitt Morison is a historical reconstruction of the official ceremony by which Perth was founded, although not everyone depicted may have actually been present. On 4 June 1829, newly arriving British colonists had their first view of the mainland. [ contradictory ] Captain James Stirling, aboard Parmelia , noted that the site was "as beautiful as anything of this kind I had ever witnessed". [ 42 ] On 12 August that year, Helen Dance, wife of the captain of the second ship, Sulphur , felled a tree to commemorate the town's founding. [ 43 ] From 1831 onward, confrontations between British settlers and the Noongar people escalated due to conflicting land-value systems and increased land use as the colony expanded. These confrontations resulted in multiple events, including the murder of settlers (such as Thomas Peel 's servant Hugh Nesbitt [ 44 ] ), the execution without trial of Whadjuk elder Midgegooroo , [ 45 ] the killing of his son Yagan in 1833, [ 46 ] and the Pinjarra massacre in 1834. [ 28 ] : 114 [ 47 ] The strained relations between the Noongar people and the Europeans arose due to these events. Agricultural development on the land restricted the traditional hunter-gatherer practices of the native Whadjuk Noongar, compelling them to camp in designated areas, including swamps and lakes north of the European settlement. Third Swamp , known to them as Boodjamooling , remained a primary campsite for the remaining Noongar people in the Perth region, also accommodating travellers, itinerants, and homeless individuals. During the gold rush in the 1890s, miners on their way to the goldfields joined this community. [ 48 ] Convict era and gold rushes [ edit ] Built by convicts in the early 1850s, Fremantle Prison is a UNESCO World Heritage Site . Perth Mint , built in 1899 to refine gold from the gold rushes In 1850, at a time when penal transportation to Australia's eastern colonies had ceased, Western Australia was opened to convicts at the request of farming and business people due to a shortage of labour. [ 49 ] Over the next eighteen years, 9,721 convicts arrived in Western Australia aboard 43 ships , [ 50 ] [ 51 ] outnumbering the approximately 7,300 free settlers. [ 52 ] The designation of Perth as a city was formally announced by Queen Victoria in 1856. However, despite this recognition, Perth remained a tranquil town. A description from 1870 by a Melbourne journalist depicted it as: [ 53 ] [ 54 ] a quiet little town of some 3000 inhabitants spread out in straggling allotments down to the water's edge, intermingled with gardens and shrubberies and half rural in its aspect ... The main streets are macadamised, but the outlying ones and most of the footpaths retain their native state from the loose sand—the all pervading element of Western Australia—productive of intense glare or much dust in the summer and dissolving into slush during the rainy season. With the discovery of gold at Kalgoorlie and Coolgardie in the late 19th century, Western Australia experienced a mining boom. [ 55 ] Perth became a key hub for supplying the goldfields, and the newfound prosperity helped finance the construction of important public buildings, roads and railways. Perth's population grew from approximately 8,500 in 1881 to 61,000 in 1901. [ 56 ] Federation and beyond [ edit ] Like many of Perth's colonial-era buildings, Moir Chambers (left) at the southwest corner of St George's Terrace and Barrack Street was demolished to make way for Citibank House during a period of substantial modernisation in the 1960s-70s. After a referendum in 1900, [ 57 ] Western Australia joined the Federation of Australia in 1901, [ 53 ] and "became a founding state of Australia". [ 28 ] It was the last of the Australian colonies to agree to join the Federation, and it did so only after the other colonies had offered several concessions, including the construction of a transcontinental railway line from Port Augusta in South Australia to Kalgoorlie to link Perth with the eastern states. [ 58 ] In 1927, Indigenous people were prohibited from entering large swathes of Perth under penalty of imprisonment, a ban that lasted until 1954. [ 59 ] In 1933, two-thirds of Western Australians voted in a referendum to secede from the rest of Australia. However, the state general election held at the same time as the referendum had voted out the pro-independence government, replacing it with a government that did not support the independence movement. Respecting the result of the referendum, the new government nonetheless petitioned the Imperial Parliament at Westminster. The House of Commons established a select committee to consider the issue but after 18 months of negotiations and lobbying, finally refused to consider the matter, declaring that it could not legally grant secession. [ 57 ] [ 60 ] Perth entered the post-war period with a population of approximately 280,000 and an economy that had not experienced sustained growth since the 1920s. Successive state governments, beginning with the Willcock Labor Government (1936–1945), determined to change this. Planning for post-war economic development was initially driven by Russell Dumas , who as Director of Public Works (1941–1953) drew up plans for Western Australia's major post-war public-works projects, including the raising of the Mundaring and Wellington dams, the development of the new Perth Airport, and the development of a new industrial zone centred on Kwinana. The advent of the McLarty Liberal Government (1947–1953) saw the emergence of something of a consensus on the need for continuing economic development. Economic growth was fuelled by large-scale public works, the post-war immigration program, and the success that various state governments had in attracting substantial foreign investment into the state, beginning with the construction of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Refinery at Kwinana in 1951–52. [ 61 ] Looking across Perth railway station c. 1955 Elizabeth Quay Bridge The result of this economic activity was the rapid growth of the population of Perth and a marked change in its urban design. Commencing in the 1950s, Perth began to expand along an extensive highway network laid out in the Stephenson-Hepburn Report , which noted that Perth was beginning to resemble a pattern of development less in line with the British experience and more in line with North America. [ 62 ] This was encouraged by the opening of the Narrows Bridge and the gradual closure of the Perth and Fremantle tram systems. The mining-pastoral boom of the 1960s only accelerated the pace of urban growth in Perth. In 1962, Perth received global media attention when city residents lit their house lights and streetlights as American astronaut John Glenn passed overhead while orbiting the Earth on Friendship 7 . This led to its being nicknamed the "City of Light". [ a ] [ 63 ] [ 64 ] [ 65 ] The city repeated the act as Glenn passed overhead on the Space Shuttle in 1998. [ 66 ] [ 67 ] Perth's development and relative prosperity, especially since the mid-1960s, [ 68 ] has resulted from its role as the main service centre for the state's resource industries, which extract gold, iron ore, nickel, alumina, diamonds, mineral sands, coal, oil and natural gas. [ 69 ] Whilst most mineral and petroleum production takes place elsewhere in the state, the non-base services provide most of the employment and income to the people of Perth. [ 70 ] Perth experienced a period of recovery in 1990. In July 1994, the state government separated the city's CBD from its suburban districts, creating the City of Perth and three other local government areas. [ citation needed ] Perth saw significant population growth in the 2000s, as well as the commencement of several major urban infrastructure projects, bolstered in part by the state's mining boom. These include the Perth Convention and Exhibition Centre (2004) and the redevelopment of the city's waterfront, giving rise to the mixed-use Elizabeth Quay precinct. Geography [ edit ] Central business district [ edit ] See also: Perth (suburb) City of Perth Library and State Buildings , Hay Street The central business district of Perth is bounded by the Swan River to the south and east, with Kings Park on the western end and the railway reserve as the northern border. [ citation needed ] A state and federally funded project named Perth City Link sank a section of the railway line to allow easy pedestrian access between Northbridge and the CBD. The Perth Arena is an entertainment and sporting arena in the city link area that has received several architectural awards from institutions such as the Design Institute of Australia , the Australian Institute of Architects , and Colorbond . [ 71 ] St Georges Terrace is the area's prominent street, with a large amount of office space in the CBD. Hay Street and Murray Street have most of the retail and entertainment facilities. The city's tallest building is Central Park , the twelfth tallest building in Australia . [ 72 ] The CBD until 2012 was the centre of a mining-induced boom, with several commercial and residential projects being built, including Brookfield Place , a 244-metre (801 ft) office building for Anglo-Australian mining company BHP . [ 73 ] Metropolitan area [ edit ] Main article: Perth metropolitan region Area of the Perth Metropolitan Region Scheme Perth's metropolitan area extends along the coast to Two Rocks in the north and Singleton to the south, [ 74 ] a distance of approximately 125 kilometres (80 mi). [ 75 ] From the coast in the west to Mundaring in the east is a distance of approximately 50 kilometres (30 mi). The Perth metropolitan area covers 6,418 square kilometres (2,478 sq mi). [ 6 ] The built-up urban area of Perth is 1,722 square kilometres (665 sq mi), the same as Wuhan or Salt Lake City and slightly smaller than London , making Perth the 67th-largest urban area in the world. Perth is also the 50th-least densely populated out of the 990 urban areas in the world with a population above 500,000. [ 76 ] The metropolitan region is defined by the Planning and Development Act 2005 to include 30 local government areas , with the outer extent being the City of Wanneroo and the City of Swan to the north, the Shire of Mundaring , City of Kalamunda and the City of Armadale to the east, the Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale to the south-east and the City of Rockingham to the south-west, and including Rottnest Island and Garden Island off the west coast. [ 77 ] This extent correlates with the Metropolitan Region Scheme , and the Australian Bureau of Statistics ' Perth (Major Statistical Division). [ 77 ] The metropolitan extent of Perth can be defined in other ways—the Australian Bureau of Statistics Greater Capital City Statistical Area, or Greater Perth in short, consists of that area, plus the City of Mandurah and the Pinjarra Level 2 Statistical Area [ 78 ] of the Shire of Murray , [ 79 ] [ 80 ] while the Regional Development Commissions Act 1993 includes the Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale in the Peel region . [ 81 ] Geology and landforms [ edit ] See also: List of islands of Perth, Western Australia The largest river flowing through Perth is the Swan River, named for the native black swans by Willem de Vlamingh , captain of a Dutch expedition and namer of Western Australia's Rottnest Island , who discovered the birds while exploring the area in 1697. [ 82 ] This water body is also known as Derbarl Yerrigan . [ 83 ] The city centre and most of the suburbs are on the sandy and relatively flat Swan Coastal Plain , which lies between the Darling Scarp and the Indian Ocean . The soils of this area are quite infertile. Much of colonial Perth was built on the Perth Wetlands , a series of freshwater wetlands running from Herdsman Lake in the west through to Claisebrook Cove in the east. [ 84 ] To the east, the city is bordered by a low escarpment called the Darling Scarp. Perth is on generally flat, rolling land, largely due to the high amount of sandy soils and deep bedrock . The Perth metropolitan area has two major river systems, one made up of the Swan and Canning Rivers, and one of the Serpentine and Murray Rivers, which discharge into the Peel Inlet at Mandurah . The Perth-Gingin Shrublands and Woodlands and Banksia Woodlands of the Swan Coastal Plain straddle the metropolitan area. Climate [ edit ] Main article: Climate of Perth Sunset over the Indian Ocean at City Beach Perth receives moderate, though highly seasonal, winter-based rainfall. Summers are generally hot, sunny and dry, lasting from December to March, with February generally the hottest month. Winters are relatively mild and wet, giving Perth a hot-summer Mediterranean climate ( Köppen climate classification Csa ). [ 85 ] [ 86 ] Perth has an average of 8.8 hours of sunshine per day, which equates to around 3,200 hours of sunshine and 138.7 clear days annually, making it Australia's sunniest capital city. [ 87 ] Summers are typically hot and dry but not completely devoid of rain, with sporadic rainfall in the form of short-lived thunderstorms, weak cold fronts and on occasions decaying tropical cyclones from Western Australia's north-west, which can bring heavy rain. Temperatures above 35 °C (95 °F) occur, on average, 26 days per year and rise above 40 °C (104 °F) on 5 days per year. The highest temperature recorded in Perth was 46.2 °C (115.2 °F) on 23 February 1991, although Perth Airport recorded 46.7 °C (116.1 °F) on the same day. [ 87 ] [ 88 ] On most summer afternoons a sea breeze , known locally as the Fremantle Doctor , blows from the south-west, providing relief from the hot north-easterly winds. Temperatures often fall below 30 °C (86 °F) a few hours after the arrival of the wind change. [ 89 ] In the summer, the 3 p.m. dewpoint averages at around 12 °C (54 °F). [ 87 ] Winters are mild and wet, with most of Perth's annual rainfall between May and September. Winters see significant rainfall as frontal systems move across the region, interspersed with clear and sunny days where minimum temperatures tend to drop below 5 °C (41 °F). The lowest temperature recorded in Perth was −0.7 °C (30.7 °F) on 17 June 2006. [ 88 ] The lowest temperature within the Perth metropolitan area was −3.4 °C (25.9 °F) on the same day at Jandakot Airport , although temperatures at or below zero are rare occurrences. The lowest maximum temperature recorded in Perth is 8.8 °C (47.8 °F) on 26 June 1956. It occasionally gets cold enough for frost to form. [ 90 ] While snow has never been recorded in the Perth CBD, light snowfalls have been reported in outer suburbs of Perth in the Perth Hills around Kalamunda , Roleystone and Mundaring . The most recent snowfall was in 1968. The rainfall pattern has changed in Perth and south-west Western Australia since the mid-1970s. A significant reduction in winter rainfall has been observed with a greater number of extreme rainfall events in the summer, [ 91 ] such as the slow-moving storms on 8 February 1992 that brought 120.6 millimetres (4.75 in) of rain, [ 88 ] [ 89 ] heavy rainfall associated with a tropical low on 10 February 2017, which brought 114.4 millimetres (4.50 in) of rain, [ 92 ] and the remnants of ex-Tropical Cyclone Joyce on 15 January 2018 with 96.2 millimetres (3.79 in).

[ 74 ] [ 100 ] Perth is Australia's fourth-most-populous city, having overtaken Adelaide in 1984. [ 101 ] In June 2023 there was an estimated resident population of 2,309,338 in the Greater Perth area, representing an increase of approximately 3.6% from the 2022 estimate of 2,228,020, the highest growth rate of Australia's capital cities. [ 5 ] Ancestry and immigration [ edit ] Country of birth (2021) [ 102 ] Birthplace [ b ] Population Australia 1,258,506 England 169,938 New Zealand 59,459 India 58,229 South Africa 38,793 Malaysia 31,268 Philippines 30,806 China 27,237 Scotland 23,280 Vietnam 17,174 Italy 16,536 Ireland 16,412 Singapore 15,387 Indonesia 13,031 Zimbabwe 10,743 At the 2021 census, the most commonly nominated ancestries were: [ 102 ] English (36.8%) Australian (27.8%) [ c ] Irish (8.8%) Scottish (8.7%) Italian (5.5%) Chinese (5.5%) Indian (3.6%) German (2.8%) Dutch (2%) Filipino (1.9%) Aboriginal (1.8%) [ d ] South African (1.4%) Maori (1.1%) Vietnamese (1.1%) New Zealander (1.1%) Croatian (1%) Perth's population is notable for the high proportion of British- and Irish-born residents. At the 2021 Census, 169,938 England-born Perth residents were counted, [ 102 ] ahead of even Sydney (151,614), [ 104 ] despite the latter having well over twice the population. Russell Square , Northbridge—historically the favoured meeting place of the Italian community of " Little Italy " [ 105 ] The ethnic make-up of Perth changed in the second part of the 20th century when significant numbers of continental European immigrants arrived in the city. Prior to this, Perth's population had been almost completely Anglo-Celtic in ethnic origin. As Fremantle was the first landfall in Australia for many migrant ships coming from Europe in the 1950s and 1960s, Perth started to experience a diverse influx of people, including Italians , Greeks , Dutch , Germans , Turks , Croats and Macedonians . The Italian influence in the Perth and Fremantle area has been substantial, evident in places like the "Cappuccino strip" in Fremantle featuring many Italian eateries and shops. In Fremantle, the traditional Italian blessing of the fleet festival is held every year at the start of the fishing season. In Northbridge every December is the San Nicola (Saint Nicholas) Festival, which involves a pageant followed by a concert, predominantly in Italian. Suburbs surrounding the Fremantle area, such as Spearwood and Hamilton Hill , also contain high concentrations of Italians, Croatians and Portuguese. Perth has also been home to a small Jewish community since 1829 [ 106 ] —numbering 6,331 in 2021—who have emigrated primarily from Eastern Europe and more recently from South Africa. [ 107 ] Chinatown entry on Roe Street A more recent wave of arrivals includes white South Africans . South Africans overtook those born in Italy as the fourth-largest foreign group in 2001. By 2016, there were 35,262 South Africans residing in Perth. [ 108 ] Many Afrikaners and Anglo-Africans emigrated to Perth during the 1980s and 1990s, with the phrase "packing for Perth" becoming associated with South Africans who choose to emigrate abroad, sometimes regardless of the destination. [ 109 ] [ 110 ] As a result, the city has been described as "the Australian capital of South Africans in exile". [ 111 ] Since the end of the White Australia policy in 1973, Asia has become an increasingly significant source of migrants, with communities from Vietnam , Malaysia , Indonesia , Thailand , Singapore , Hong Kong , Mainland China and India all now well established. There were 112,293 persons of Chinese descent in Perth in 2016—5.3% of the city's population. [ 102 ] These are supported by the Australian Eurasian Association of Western Australia, [ 112 ] which also serves a community of Portuguese-Malacca Eurasian or Kristang immigrants. [ 113 ] Middle Eastern immigrants have a presence in Perth. They come from a variety of countries, including Saudi Arabia , Syria , Iran , Iraq , Israel , Lebanon , The United Arab Emirates , Oman , Yemen and Afghanistan . The Indian community includes a substantial number of Parsees who emigrated from Bombay —Perth being the closest Australian city to India—in 2021 those with Indian ancestry accounted for 3.5% of Perth's population [ 102 ] Perth is also home to the largest population of Anglo-Burmese in the world; many settled here following the independence of Burma in 1948 with immigration taking off after 1962. The city is now the cultural hub for Anglo-Burmese worldwide. [ 114 ] There is also a substantial Anglo-Indian population in Perth, who also settled in the city following the independence of India. At the 2021 census, 2% of Perth's population identified as being Aboriginal and/or Torres Strait Islander . [ e ] [ 115 ] Language [ edit ] At the 2021 census, 74% of inhabitants spoke only English at home, with the next most common languages being Mandarin (2.3%), Italian (1.1%), Vietnamese (1.0%), Punjabi (0.9%) and Cantonese (0.9%). [ 115 ] Religion [ edit ] St Mary's Cathedral 41.8% of the 2021 census respondents in Perth had no religion, [ 115 ] as against 38.4% of national population. [ 115 ] In 1911, the national figure was 0.4%. [ 116 ] Catholics are the largest single Christian denomination in the Greater Perth area at 19.5%. [ 115 ] Perth is the seat of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Perth . [ 117 ] The Personal Ordinariate of Our Lady of the Southern Cross claims over 2,000 members. [ 118 ] Anglicans are 9.9% of the population. [ 115 ] Perth is the seat of the Anglican Diocese of Perth . [ 119 ] Buddhism and Islam each have more than 50,000 adherents. [ 120 ] The suburb of Gidgengannup in the Perth Hills is home to the Dhammasara Nuns Monastery of the Buddhist Thai Forest Tradition . [ 121 ] [ 122 ] Over 31,000 members of the Uniting Church in Australia live in Perth. [ 120 ] Perth has the third largest Jewish population in Australia, numbering approximately 6,331 in the 2021 census. [ 107 ] Perth's Jewish Day School , Carmel School claims a city Jewish population closer to 10,000. [ 123 ] The city is home to both Orthodox and Progressive synagogues, most notably Perth Hebrew Congregation and Temple David . There is also a Chabad house in Perth. The Baháʼí community in Perth numbers around 2,178. [ 120 ] Hinduism has over 49,000 adherents in Perth; [ 120 ] the Diwali (festival of lights) celebration in 2009 attracted over 20,000 visitors. There are Hindu temples in Canning Vale , Anketell and a Swaminarayan temple in Bennett Springs . [ 124 ] Hinduism is the fastest growing religion in Australia. [ 125 ] Perth is also home to 4,719 Mormons [ 120 ] and the Perth Australia Temple of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints . Governance [ edit ] Perth, like the rest of Australia, is governed by three levels of government: local, state and federal. [ 126 ] Local [ edit ] Further information: Local government areas of Western Australia Parliament House The Perth metropolitan area is divided into thirty local government bodies , including the City of Perth which administers Perth's central business district. The outer extent of the administrative region of Perth comprises the City of Wanneroo and the City of Swan to the north, the Shire of Mundaring , City of Kalamunda and the City of Armadale to the east, the Shire of Serpentine-Jarrahdale to the south-east and the City of Rockingham to the south-west, and including the islands of Rottnest Island and Garden Island off the west coast. [ 127 ] State [ edit ] Further information: Government of Western Australia Supreme Court of Western Australia Perth houses the Parliament of Western Australia and the Governor of Western Australia . As of the 2008 state election [update] , 42 of the Legislative Assembly 's 59 seats and 18 of the Legislative Council 's 36 seats are based in Perth's metropolitan area. The state's highest court, the Supreme Court , is located in Perth, [ 128 ] along with the District [ 129 ] and Family [ 130 ] Courts. The Magistrates' Court has six metropolitan locations. [ 131 ] Federal [ edit ] Further information: Government of Australia Government House Perth is represented by 10 full seats and significant parts of three others in the Federal House of Representatives, with the seats of Canning, Pearce and Brand including some areas outside the metropolitan area. The Federal Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia (previously the Federal Magistrates Court) [ 132 ] [ 133 ] occupy the Commonwealth Law Courts building on Victoria Avenue, [ 134 ] which is also the location for annual Perth sittings of Australia's High Court . [ 135 ] Economy [ edit ] See also: Economy of Western Australia Brookfield Place towering above heritage buildings in the CBD. Built during the late 2000s mining boom, it is tenanted by the mining company BHP . By virtue of its population and role as the administrative centre for business and government, Perth dominates the Western Australian economy, despite the major mining, petroleum and agricultural export industries being located elsewhere in the state. [ 136 ] Perth's function as the state's capital city, its economic base and population size have also created development opportunities for many other businesses oriented to local or more diversified markets.
Perth's economy has been changing in favour of the service industries since the 1950s. Although one of the major sets of services it provides is related to the resources industry and, to a lesser extent, agriculture, most people in Perth are not connected to either; they have jobs that provide services to other people in Perth. [ 137 ] As a result of Perth's relative geographical isolation, it has never had the necessary conditions to develop significant manufacturing industries other than those serving the immediate needs of its residents, mining, agriculture and some specialised areas, such as, in recent times, niche shipbuilding and maintenance. It was simply cheaper to import all the needed manufactured goods from either the eastern states or overseas. Industrial employment influenced the economic geography of Perth. After WWII, Perth experienced suburban expansion aided by high levels of car ownership. Workforce decentralisation and transport improvements made it possible for the establishment of small-scale manufacturing in the suburbs. Many firms took advantage of relatively cheap land to build spacious, single-storey plants in suburban locations with plentiful parking, easy access and minimal traffic congestion. "The former close ties of manufacturing with near-central and/or rail-side locations were loosened." [ 136 ] Bulk carrier at the CBH Grain Jetty in East Rockingham Industrial estates such as Kwinana , Welshpool and Kewdale were post-war additions contributing to the growth of manufacturing south of the river. The establishment of the Kwinana industrial area was supported by standardisation of the east–west rail gauge linking Perth with eastern Australia. Since the 1950s the area has been dominated by heavy industry, including an oil refinery, steel-rolling mill with a blast furnace, alumina refinery, power station and a nickel refinery. Another development, also linked with rail standardisation, was in 1968 when the Kewdale Freight Terminal was developed adjacent to the Welshpool industrial area, replacing the former Perth railway yards. [ 136 ] With significant population growth post-WWII, [ 138 ] employment growth occurred not in manufacturing but in retail and wholesale trade, business services, health, education, community and personal services, and in public administration. Increasingly it was these services sectors, concentrated around the Perth metropolitan area, that provided jobs. [ 136 ] Perth has also become a hub of technology-focused startups since the early 2000s that provide a pool of highly skilled jobs to the Perth community. Companies such as Canva , VGW, Appbot, Agworld and Healthengine all hail from Perth and have made headlines internationally. Organisations like StartupWA, Spacecubed and Perth Angels, and programs like Meshpoints, Curtin Accelerate and Plus Eight are all focused on creating a thriving startup culture in Perth and growing the next generation of Perth-based employers. [ 139 ] Education [ edit ] See also: Education in Western Australia Education is compulsory in Western Australia between the ages of six and seventeen, corresponding to primary and secondary school. [ 140 ] Tertiary education is available through several universities and technical and further education (TAFE) colleges. Primary and secondary [ edit ] Perth Modern School , Perth's first public high school Students may attend either public schools, run by the state government's Department of Education , or private schools, usually associated with a religion, or engage in home schooling. The Western Australian Certificate of Education (WACE) is the credential given to students who have completed Years 11 and 12 of their secondary schooling. [ 141 ] In 2012 the minimum requirements for students to receive their WACE changed [ how? ] . [ 142 ] Tertiary [ edit ] The University of Western Australia , located in Crawley Perth is home to four public universities: the University of Western Australia , Curtin University , Murdoch University and Edith Cowan University . There are also two private universities, the University of Notre Dame Australia , and a local campus of the University of Divinity . The University of Western Australia , which was founded in 1911, [ 143 ] is renowned as one of Australia's leading research institutions. [ 144 ] The university's monumental neo-classical architecture, most of which is carved from white limestone, is a notable tourist destination in the city. It is the only university in the state to be a member of the Group of Eight , as well as the Sandstone universities . It is also the state's only university to have produced a Nobel Laureate : [ 145 ] Barry Marshall , who graduated with a Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery in 1975 and was awarded a joint Nobel Prize in physiology or medicine in 2005 with Robin Warren . Curtin University , previously known as Western Australian Institute of Technology (1966–1986) and Curtin University of Technology (1986–2010), is Western Australia's largest university by student population. [ 146 ] Murdoch University was founded in 1973 and incorporates Western Australia's only veterinary school and, until its controversial closure in 2020, Australia's only theology program to be completely integrated into a secular university. Edith Cowan University was established in 1991 from the existing Western Australian College of Advanced Education which itself was formed on 11 December 1981 from the existing Teachers Colleges at Claremont, Nedlands, Churchlands and Mount Lawley after Graylands had merged into Claremont, Churchlands and Mount Lawley in 1979. It incorporates the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts . The University of Notre Dame Australia was established in 1990. Notre Dame was established as a Catholic university with its lead campus in Fremantle and a large campus in Sydney, and a campus in Broome. Its lead campus is in the west end of Fremantle, using historic port buildings built in the 1890s, giving Notre Dame a distinct European university atmosphere. The Melbourne-based University of Divinity established a campus in Perth in 2022 through its admission of Wollaston College , the theological college of the Anglican Diocese of Perth , as a collegiate college of the University. Colleges of TAFE provide trade and vocational training, including certificate- and diploma-level courses. TAFE began as a system of technical colleges and schools under the Education Department, from which they were separated in the 1980s and ultimately formed into regional colleges. Two are in the Perth metropolitan area: North Metropolitan TAFE (formerly Central Institute of Technology and West Coast Institute of Training ); and South Metropolitan TAFE (formerly Polytechnic West and Challenger Institute of Technology ).

[ 161 ] Perth Concert Hall Due to Perth's relative isolation from other Australian cities, overseas performing artists sometimes exclude it from their Australian tour schedules. This isolation, however, is considered a key factor in the development of a distinct and tight-knit music scene in Perth, with many bands and artists hailing from the city. [ 173 ] Famous musical performers from Perth include the late AC/DC frontman Bon Scott , whose heritage-listed grave at Fremantle Cemetery is reportedly the most visited grave in Australia.

St John of God Murdoch and Subiaco Hospitals, and Hollywood Hospital are large privately owned and operated hospitals. A number of other public and private hospitals operate in Perth. [ 195 ] Transport [ edit ] Main article: Transport in Perth, Western Australia Transperth B-Series train at Perth railway station Perth is served by Perth Airport in the city's east for regional, domestic and international flights and Jandakot Airport in the city's southern suburbs for general aviation and charter flights. Perth has a road network with three freeways— Mitchell , Kwinana and Graham Farmer —and nine metropolitan highways. The Northbridge Tunnel , part of the Graham Farmer Freeway, is the only significant road tunnel in Perth. Perth metropolitan public transport is known as Transperth , and includes trains , buses and ferries, which are provided by the Public Transport Authority . Links to rural areas provided by Transwa . There are 74 railway stations and 14 bus-only stations on the Transperth network. [ 196 ] Perth provides zero-fare bus and train trips around the city centre (the "Free Transit Zone"), including four high-frequency CAT bus routes. The Indian Pacific passenger rail service connects Perth with Adelaide and Sydney once per week in each direction. The Prospector passenger rail service connects Perth with Kalgoorlie via several Wheatbelt towns, while the Australind connects to Bunbury , the MerredinLink connects to Merredin and the AvonLink connects to Northam .

[ 197 ] The Fremantle Outer Harbour at Cockburn Sound is one of Australia's major bulk cargo ports. [ 198 ] Utilities [ edit ] Mundaring Weir Perth's electricity is predominantly generated, supplied and retailed by three Western Australian Government corporations. Verve Energy operates coal and gas power generation stations, as well as wind farms and other power sources. [ 199 ] The physical network is maintained by Western Power , [ 200 ] while Synergy , the state's largest energy retailer, sells electricity to residential and business customers. [ 201 ] Alinta Energy , which was previously a government owned company, had a monopoly in the domestic gas market since the 1990s. However, in 2013 Kleenheat Gas began operating in the market, allowing consumers to choose their gas retailer. [ 202 ] The Water Corporation is the dominant supplier of water, as well as wastewater and drainage services, in Perth and throughout Western Australia . It is also owned by the state government. [ 203 ] Perth's water supply has traditionally relied on both groundwater and rain-fed dams. Reduced rainfall in the region over recent decades had greatly lowered inflow to reservoirs and affected groundwater levels. Coupled with the city's relatively high growth rate, this led to concerns that Perth could run out of water in the near future. [ 204 ] The Western Australian Government responded by building desalination plants, and introducing mandatory household sprinkler restrictions . The Kwinana Desalination Plant was opened in 2006, [ 205 ] [ 206 ] and Southern Seawater Desalination Plant at Binningup (on the coast between Mandurah and Bunbury) began operating in 2011. A trial winter (1 June – 31 August) sprinkler ban was introduced in 2009 by the State Government, a move which the Government later announced would be made permanent. [ 207 ] Sister cities [ edit ] Perth's sister cities are: Kagoshima , Japan (est. 1974) Houston , United States (est. 1984) Megisti , Greece (est. 1984) Rhodes , Greece (est. 1984) San Diego , United States * (est. 1987) Vasto , Italy (est. 1989) Nanjing , China (est. 1998) Taipei , Taiwan (est. 1999) Perth , Scotland (est. 2006) Seocho , South Korea (est. 2008) Chengdu , China (est. 2012) See also [ edit ] 1955 Plan for the Metropolitan Region, Perth and Fremantle List of islands of Perth, Western Australia List of Perth suburbs List of tallest buildings in Perth Notes [ edit ] ^ The city most commonly referred to as the "City of Light" is Paris .
