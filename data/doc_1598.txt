Do not fill this in! ==Springs and dampers==
Most conventional suspensions use passive [[spring (device)|springs]] to absorb impacts and dampers (or shock absorbers) to control spring motions.

Some notable exceptions are [[hydropneumatic]] systems, which can be treated as an integrated unit of gas spring and damping components, used by the French manufacturer [[Citroën]]; and the [[hydrolastic]], [[hydragas]] and rubber cone systems used by the [[British Motor Corporation]], most notably on the [[Mini]]. A number of different types of each have been used:

===Passive suspensions===
Traditional springs and dampers are referred to as passive suspensions — most vehicles are suspended in this manner.

====Springs====
[[File:Pneumatic spring.JPG|Pneumatic spring on a semitrailer|thumb|right]]

The majority of land vehicles are suspended by steel springs of these types:
* [[Leaf spring]] – AKA Hotchkiss, Cart, or semi-elliptical spring<ref name=ID3/>
* [[Torsion bar suspension]]<ref name="ID4">{{cite web |title=Suspension Basics 4 - Torsion Bar Springs |work=Initial Dave |url=http://www.initialdave.com/cars/tech/suspensionbasics04.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100510005045/http://www.initialdave.com/cars/tech/suspensionbasics04.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2010-05-10 |access-date=2015-01-29}}</ref>
* [[Coil spring]]<ref name="ID5">{{cite web |title=Suspension Basics 5 - Coil Springs |work=Initial Dave |url=http://www.initialdave.com/cars/tech/suspensionbasics05.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20120501235454/http://www.initialdave.com/cars/tech/suspensionbasics05.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-05-01 |access-date=2015-01-29}}</ref>

Automakers are aware of the inherent limitations of steel springs &mdash; that these springs tend to produce undesirable oscillations, and carmakers have developed other types of suspension materials and mechanisms in attempts to improve performance:

====Dampers or shock absorbers====
Shock absorbers damp out the (otherwise simple harmonic) motions of a vehicle up and down on its springs. They must also damp out much of the wheel bounce when the unsprung weight of a wheel, hub, axle, and sometimes brakes and the [[differential (mechanics)|differential]] bounces up and down on the springiness of a tire.

===Semi-active and active suspensions===
{{main|Active suspension}}
If suspension is externally controlled, then it is a semi-active or active suspension — the suspension is reacting to signals from an electronic controller.

For example, a hydropneumatic Citroën will "know" how far off the ground the car is supposed to be, and constantly resets to achieve that level, regardless of load. However, this type of suspension will ''not'' instantly compensate for body roll due to cornering. Citroën's system adds about 1% to the cost of the car versus passive steel springs.

Semi-active suspensions include devices, such as [[Air suspension|air springs]] and switchable shock absorbers, various [[self-levelling suspension|self-levelling]] solutions, as well as systems, like [[hydropneumatic]], [[hydrolastic]], and [[hydragas]] suspensions.

Toyota introduced switchable shock absorbers in the 1983 Soarer.<ref name="Toyota_Soarer">{{cite web |title=Technical Development {{!}} Chassis |work=75 Years of TOYOTA |publisher=Toyota |year=2012 |url= http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/automotive_business/products_technology/technology_development/chassis/index.html |access-date=2018-05-16}}</ref> Delphi currently sells shock absorbers filled with a [[MR fluid|magneto-rheological fluid]], whose viscosity can be changed electromagnetically &mdash; thereby giving variable control without switching valves, which is faster and thus more effective.

Fully [[active suspension]] systems use electronic monitoring of vehicle conditions, coupled with the means to change the behavior of vehicle suspension in real time to directly control the motion of the car.

[[Lotus Cars]] developed several prototypes from 1982 onwards, and introduced them to [[Formula One]], where they have been fairly effective, but have now been banned.

[[Nissan]] introduced low-bandwidth active suspension ''circa'' 1990 as an option that added an extra 20% to the price of luxury models. Citroën has also developed several active suspension models (see [[hydractive]]). A fully active system from [[Bose Corporation]], announced in 2009, uses linear electric motors<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.extremetech.com/extreme/259042-bose-sells-off-revolutionary-electromagnetic-suspension |title=Bose Sells Off Its Revolutionary Electromagnetic Suspension |first=Bill |last=Howard |work=ExtremeTech |location=US |date=2017-11-15 |access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thedrive.com/news/20996/the-crazy-bose-magic-carpet-car-suspension-system-is-finally-headed-for-production|title=The Bose 'Magic Carpet' Car Suspension System Is Finally Headed For Production|first=Kyle|last=Cheromcha|website=The Drive|date=22 May 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=https://www.digitaltrends.com/cars/boses-revolutionary-adaptive-suspension-gets-a-reboot-for-2019/?amp |title=Bose's Revolutionary Adaptive Suspension Gets a Reboot for 2019 |first=Chris |last=Chin |work=Digital Trends |location=US |date=2018-05-21 |access-date=2020-01-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://auto.howstuffworks.com/car-suspension.htm|title=How Car Suspensions Work|date=May 11, 2005|website=HowStuffWorks}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1116747_after-30-years-bose-developed-suspension-tech-will-go-into-production|title=After 30 years, Bose-developed suspension tech will go into production|website=Motor Authority|date=15 May 2018 }}</ref> in place of hydraulic or pneumatic actuators that have generally been used up until recently. [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] introduced an active suspension system called [[Active Body Control]] in its top-of-the-line [[Mercedes-Benz CL-Class]] in 1999.

Several [[electromagnetic suspension]]s have also been developed for vehicles. Examples include the electromagnetic suspension of Bose, and the electromagnetic suspension developed by prof. Laurentiu Encica. In addition, the new Michelin wheel with embedded suspension functioning on an electric motor is also similar.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amt.nl/web/Nieuws/Autotechniek/Tonen-Nieuws-Autotechniek/Zwevend-over-de-weg-met-magneetvering.htm |title=Electromagnetic suspension |publisher=Amt.nl |date=2008-11-19 |access-date=2012-08-16 |archive-date=4 January 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104192737/http://www.amt.nl/web/Nieuws/Autotechniek/Tonen-Nieuws-Autotechniek/Zwevend-over-de-weg-met-magneetvering.htm |url-status=dead }}</ref>

With the help of a control system, various semi-active/active suspensions realize an improved design compromise among different vibration modes of the vehicle; namely: bounce, roll, pitch and warp modes. However, the applications of these advanced suspensions are constrained by cost, packaging, weight, reliability, and/or other challenges.

===Interconnected suspensions===
Interconnected suspension, unlike semi-active/active suspensions, could easily decouple different vehicle vibration modes in a passive manner. Interconnections can be realized by various means, such as mechanical, hydraulic, and pneumatic. Anti-roll bars are one of the typical examples of mechanical interconnections, while it has been stated, that fluidic interconnections offer greater potential and flexibility in improving both the stiffness and damping properties.

Considering the considerable commercial potentials of hydro-pneumatic technology (<!--Toyota?-->Corolla, 1996), interconnected [[hydropneumatic suspension]]s have also been explored in some recent studies, and their potential benefits in enhancing vehicle ride and handling have been demonstrated. The control system can also be used for further improving performance of interconnected suspensions. Apart from academic research, an Australian company Kinetic<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kinetic.au.com |title=Kinetic Suspension Technology |publisher=Kinetic |location=Australia |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090411084359/http://www.kinetic.au.com/ |archive-date=2009-04-11 |url-status=dead}}</ref> had some success with various passive or semi-active systems ([[World Rally Championship|WRC]]: three Championships; the [[Dakar Rally]]: two Championships; Lexus GX470 2004 as the 4×4 of the year with KDSS; the 2005 PACE award). These systems by Kinetic generally decouple at least two vehicle modes (roll, warp (articulation), pitch, and/or heave (bounce)) to simultaneously control each mode's stiffness and damping by using interconnected shock absorbers, and other methods. In 1999, Kinetic was bought out by Tenneco. Later developments by the Catalan company [http://www.creuat.com Creuat] have devised a simpler system design based on single-acting cylinders. After some projects on competition, Creuat is active in providing retrofit systems for some vehicle models.

Historically, the first mass-production car with front-to-rear mechanical interconnected suspension was the 1948 [[Citroën 2CV]]. Suspension in the 2CV was extremely soft — the longitudinal link was making pitch softer, instead of making roll stiffer. It relied on extreme anti-dive and anti-squat geometries to compensate for that. This resulted in a softer axle-crossing stiffness that anti-roll bars would have otherwise compromised. The leading arm / trailing arm [[trailing arm|swinging arm]], fore-aft linked suspension system, together with in-board front brakes, had a much smaller [[unsprung weight]] than existing coil spring or leaf designs. The interconnection transmitted some of the force deflecting a front wheel up over a bump, to push the rear wheel down on the same side. When the rear wheel met that bump a moment later, it did the same in reverse, keeping the car level front to rear. The 2CV had a design brief to be able to be driven at speed over a ploughed field, such as by a farmer transporting chicken eggs. It originally featured friction dampers and [[tuned mass damper]]s. Later models had [[tuned mass damper]]s at the front with telescopic dampers/shock absorbers front and rear.

[[British Motor Corporation]]<!--proper name, 'the' not part of the name.--> was also an early adopter of interconnected suspension. A system dubbed ''[[Hydrolastic]]'' was introduced in 1962 on [[BMC ADO16|Morris 1100]], and went on to be used on a variety of BMC models. ''Hydrolastic'' was developed by suspension engineer [[Alex Moulton]], and used rubber cones as the springing medium (these were first used on the 1959 [[Mini]]) with suspension units on each side connected to each other by a fluid-filled pipe. The fluid transmitted the force of road bumps from one wheel to the other (on the same principle as Citroën 2CV's mechanical system described above), and because each suspension unit contained valves to restrict the flow of fluid, also served as a shock absorber.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mgfcar.de/hydragas/moulton.htm |title=Alex Moulton Mgf Hydragas |publisher=Mgfcar.de |access-date=2012-08-16}}</ref> Moulton went on to develop a replacement for ''Hydrolastic'' for BMC's successor [[British Leyland]]. This system, manufactured under licence by Dunlop in Coventry, called ''[[Hydrolastic#Hydragas|Hydragas]]'', worked with the same principle, but instead of rubber spring units, it used metal spheres divided internally by a rubber diaphragm. The top half contained pressurised gas, and the lower half the same fluid as used on the ''Hydrolastic'' system. The fluid transmitted suspension forces between the units on each side, whilst the gas acted as the springing medium through the diaphragm. This is the same principle as the Citroën [[Hydropneumatic suspension|hydropneumatic]] system, and provides similar [[ride quality]], but is self-contained, and does not require an engine-driven pump to provide hydraulic pressure. The downside is, that ''Hydragas'' is, unlike the Citroën system, not height-adjustable, or self-levelling. ''Hydragas'' was introduced in 1973 on [[Austin Allegro]], and was used on several models; the last car to use it being [[MG F / MG TF|MG F]] in 2002. The system was changed in favour of coil springs over dampers due to cost reasons towards the end of the vehicle's life. When it was decommissioned in 2006, the ''Hydragas'' manufacturing line was over 40 years old.

Some of the last post-war [[Packard]] models also featured interconnected suspension.
