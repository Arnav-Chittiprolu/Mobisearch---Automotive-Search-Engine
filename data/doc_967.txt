From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This is a list of piston engines developed by Nissan Motors . Engine naming convention [ edit ] Nissan uses a straightforward method of naming their automobile engines . The first few letters identify the engine family.  The following digits are the displacement in deciliters .  Finally, the trailing letters encode the main engine features, and are ordered based on the type of feature. Below is a list of encoded letters, and the engine features they represent. Make note, the first few letters in the engine name that identify the engine family have nothing to do with these encoded letters for the engine features, and should not be confused as such. Letter Feature Feature type D DOHC Camshaft V Variable Valve Lift Camshaft S Carburetor Fuel delivery T Twin carburetors (e.g. L16T and L18T) Fuel delivery i Throttle Body Fuel Injection Fuel delivery E Multi Port Fuel Injection Fuel delivery D Direct Cylinder Fuel Injection Fuel delivery N Natural gas fueled Fuel delivery P LPG fueled Fuel delivery R Supercharged Power adder T Turbocharged Power adder Ti Turbocharged and intercooled Power adder TT Twin-Turbocharged Power adder HR High Response and High Revolution Special K Improvement (from Kaizen ) Special e Engines specifically built as a power generator for electric motors Special The encoded letters that represent engine features follow a specific order and not all features are necessarily listed all of the time. The basic, common features follow this general order: [Engine family] [two-digit engine displacement in deciliters] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] 1 = Camshaft 2 = Fuel delivery 3 = Power adder 4 = 2nd power adder 5 = Special A good example to start with is the Nissan VG30DETT engine. It belongs to the VG engine family , displaces 30 deciliters (3.0 liters), and the feature letters describe an engine with dual overhead camshafts, electronic port fuel injection and two turbochargers. The next example is the Nissan VQ35DE engine. It belongs to the VQ engine family and displaces 35 deciliters (3.5 liters). The feature letters describe an engine with dual overhead camshafts and electronic port fuel injection, but leaves off any power adder descriptors because it is a naturally aspirated engine. The (single) turbocharged version of the VQ displaces 30 deciliters (3.0 liters) and is logically called the VQ30DET . Not all features are necessarily described in the name. For example, the SR20VE engine has dual overhead camshafts, but the variable valve lift design of the camshafts takes precedence in the naming scheme even though the "V" feature designation doesn't necessarily describe a DOHC arrangement. Many standard DOHC Nissan engines featured Variable Valve Timing, such as the VG30DETT , and as such do not use the "V" designation. The "V" designation is applied only if the engine has variable valve lift. A good example of an engine where not all of the feature designation spots are used is the L28ET engine. The two features listed are electronic port fuel injection designated with the "E" and the presence of a turbocharger designed with the letter "T". The engine has a single overhead camshaft so there is no "D" listed in the name; the camshaft type designation place being left out completely. Nissan does not have a letter designation for the SOHC configuration so the camshaft configuration type is assumed as SOHC if no letter is present. Another useful example (because it repeats letters which have different meanings based on their order) is the MR16DDT engine, which has feature designations that describe an engine with dual overhead camshafts, direct cylinder fuel injection and a single turbocharger.
