From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Belt tensioner ) Device that creates or maintains tension Chain tensioner on a single-speed bicycle Belt tensioner on a belt-drive bicycle A tensioner is a device that applies a force to create or maintain tension . The force may be applied parallel to, as in the case of a hydraulic bolt tensioner, or perpendicular to, as in the case of a spring-loaded bicycle chain tensioner, the tension it creates. The force may be generated by a fixed displacement, as in the case of an eccentric bicycle bottom bracket , which must be adjusted as parts wear, or by stretching or compressing a spring , as in the case of a spring-loaded bicycle chain tensioner; by changing the volume of a gas, as in the case of a marine riser tensioner; by hydraulic pressure, as in the case of a hydraulic bolt tensioner; or by gravity acting on a suspended mass, as in the case of a chair lift cable tensioner. Applications [ edit ] Bolt tensioners are devices designed to apply a specific tension to a bolt . The device may be either removed once the actual nut is threaded into place or left in place, in the case of a hydraulic nut. [ 1 ] The belt or chain tension on a single-speed bicycle can be maintained by either setting the fixed horizontal position of the rear sprocket or the front chainring horizontally, or by a separate tensioner that pushes perpendicular to the chain with either a fixed position or spring tension. [ 2 ] The serpentine belt and the timing belt or chain on an automobile engine may be guided by an idler pulley and/or a belt tensioner, which may be spring-loaded, hydraulic, or fixed. [ 3 ] The chain tension of a chainsaw may be adjusted with a chain tensioner. [ 4 ] A marine riser tensioner is a device used on an offshore drilling vessel that provides a near-constant upward force on the drilling riser independent of the movement of the floating drill vessel. A guideline tensioner is a hydropneumatic device used on an offshore drilling rig that keeps a positive pulling force on the guidelines from the platform to a template on the seabed. Overhead electrical wires may be kept in tension by springs or weights. Conveyor belts Chair lift and gondola lift cables Certain wood trusses , such as the beam tensioner truss picture below. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Fencing made of wire, such as electric fences , barbed-wire fences, and chainlink fences often include tensioning devices to keep them taut. Belt sanders have a mechanism, often a spring-loaded idler drum, to apply the proper tension to the sanding belt, which can be released to allow for changing belts.
