[ 1 ] The all-wheel-drive Aurora allegedly borrowed its framework from the square-shaped front-wheel-drive DeVille . Unlike the DeVille, which positioned its engine transversely, the Aurora placed longitudinally. [ 2 ] Production plans and name passing [ edit ] Cadillac would not go on to produce the car, but the name was passed to Oldsmobile . In terms of powertrain concept and interior design, the series production version of it became the Oldsmobile Aurora , unveiled in 1995.

Media appearances and fate [ edit ] The concept appeared in a scene in the movie Demolition Man . [ 4 ] In May 2024, it was reported by caranddriver.com that the same Cadillac Aurora that appeared in Demolition Man was spotted at a parking lot in Detroit where General Motors (owners of Cadillac) usually places vehicles due for the car crusher , implying its imminent destruction. [ 5 ] Photographs of the Cadillac Aurora in the parking park were posted on the website where the car was shown parked metal-to-metal with a Buick LaCrosse .
