From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Internal combustion engine with two banks of cylinders at an angle resembling a 'V' V-twin motorcycle engine (circa 1910) V6 car engine (circa 1990) A V engine , sometimes called a Vee engine , is a common configuration for internal combustion engines . It consists of two cylinder banks —usually with the same number of cylinders in each bank—connected to a common crankshaft . These cylinder banks are arranged at an angle to each other, so that the banks form a "V" shape when viewed from the front of the engine. V engines typically have a shorter length than equivalent inline engines , however the trade-off is a larger width. V6 , V8 and V12 engines are the most common layout for automobile engines with 6, 8 or 12 cylinders respectively. History [ edit ] The first V engine, a two-cylinder V-twin, was designed by Wilhelm Maybach and used in the 1889 Daimler Stahlradwagen automobile. [ 1 ] The first V8 engine was produced in 1903, in the form of the Antoinette engine designed by Léon Levavasseur for racing boats and airplanes . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The first V12 engine was produced the following year by Putney Motor Works in London , again for use in racing boats. [ 4 ] The first V6 engine to reach production appeared soon after in 1908, by the Deutz Gasmotoren Fabrik in Germany for use as a generator for gasoline-electric railway engines . [ 5 ] However, it was not until 1950 that the V6 engine was used in series production automobiles, with the first example being the Lancia V6 engine . [ 5 ] This V6 engine used a 60-degree V angle and separate crankpins for each cylinder, to reduce the vibration issues experienced by earlier attempts at production V6 engines. Characteristics [ edit ] Compared with an equivalent inline engine (the most common configuration for engines with less than six cylinders), a V engine has a shorter length but is wider. This effect increases with the number of cylinders in the engine; the length difference between V-twin and straight-twin engines might be insignificant, however V8 engines have a significantly smaller length than straight engines. [ 6 ] Compared with the less common flat engine , a V engine is narrower, taller and has a higher center of mass . V-angle illustrated by the yellow lines The "V-angle" (or "included angle") between the cylinder banks varies significantly between engines. Some engines have used a V-angle of 180 degrees (the same angle as a flat engine ), such as several Ferrari V12 engines. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] At the other end of the scale, the 1922–1976 Lancia V4 engine and the 1991–present Volkswagen VR6 engine use V-angles as small as 10 degrees, along with a single cylinder head used by both banks of cylinders. The engine balance of a V12 engine is that of perfect primary and secondary balance. For V engines with fewer cylinders, the engine balance will depend on factors such as the firing interval, crankshaft counterweights and whether balance shafts are present. The crankpins on a V engine are usually shared by two cylinders from opposing banks, with an offset between the two cylinders. Alternative configurations are separate crankpins per cylinder (such as several V-twin engines) or articulated connecting rods . Inverted engines [ edit ] Argus As 10 inverted engine Some airplanes of the 1920s and 1930s used inverted engines , whereby the crankshaft is located at the top of the engine and the cylinder heads are at the bottom. Advantages include better visibility in a single-engined airplane, a higher thrust line, and resultant increased ground clearance for the propeller. Examples include the 1928 Argus As 10 V8 engine and the 1935 Daimler-Benz DB 601 V12 engines. Specific configurations [ edit ] V8 truck engine V12 Formula One engine from 1991 It is common practice for V engines to be described with "V # " notation, where # represents the number of cylinders. Configurations of V engines which have reached production are as follows: V-twin (also known as "V2") V3 V4 V5 V6 V8 V10 V12 V14 V16 V18 V20 V24 V32 See also [ edit ] Straight engine Flat engine Radial engine U engine H engine W engine X engine Media related to V engines at Wikimedia Commons References [ edit ] ^ Larson, Len (2008).
