From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia CEOs and Chairmen [ edit ] The position of CEO and Chairman have been assumed as a single position, unless noted (CEOs who were not Chairman were generally President at the time). From April to September 2006, the role of President was absorbed into the role of Executive Chairman.
