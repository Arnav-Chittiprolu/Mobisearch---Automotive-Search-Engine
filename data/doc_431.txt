The first generation was based on the PQ46 platform , while the second generation, released in 2016, utilizes the Volkswagen Group MQB A2 platform . [ 1 ] It is generally considered to be a medium-sized SUV in Europe, [ 2 ] [ 3 ] while in North America it is considered to be a compact crossover SUV . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The name Tiguan is a portmanteau of the German words Tiger (" tiger ") and Leguan (" iguana ") and won a naming contest by German car magazine publisher Auto Bild —from a field of names that also included Namib , Rockton , Samun and Nanuk . [ 6 ] As of the spring of 2020, six million units had been sold worldwide, with 910,926 units being manufactured in 2019 alone, making the Tiguan the best-selling car overall in the Volkswagen Group . It was also the best-selling SUV in Europe.

[ 14 ] [ 15 ] The production form of the Tiguan was revealed online in June 2007 [ 16 ] [ 17 ] following a prototype preview in Namibia, [ 18 ] before being officially launched at the Frankfurt International Motor Show in September 2007. [ 19 ] The Tiguan went on sale in Europe in early 2008, [ 20 ] and was initially available with two engines, a 2.0-litre 140 PS (138 hp; 103 kW) TDI and a 1.4-litre 150 PS (148 hp; 110 kW) TSI petrol unit. All first generation Tiguans featured two-row seating and transversely mounted four-cylinder engines. Production began in the end of 2007 at Volkswagen's subsidiary Auto 5000 in Wolfsburg and continued subsequently under the company's standard contract arrangements, at Wolfsburg and in Kaluga, Russia. [ 21 ] [ 22 ] The first generation Tiguan is based on the PQ46 platform , which is shared with the four corporate siblings, Volkswagen Passat (B6) , Volkswagen Sharan (7N) , Škoda Superb (3T) and SEAT Alhambra (7N) . [ 13 ] A common misconception is that the Tiguan is built on the PQ35 chassis that underpins the Mk5 and Mk6 generation Volkswagen Golf. While the PQ46 chassis is based upon the PQ35 platform, there are several differences between the more entry level PQ35 and the mid range PQ46. It shares the same dashboard design with the Golf Plus . [ 23 ] It has a 0.37 drag coefficient. [ 24 ] Europe [ edit ] Trim levels [ edit ] Interior The Tiguan in Europe was offered worldwide in various trim levels. In the United States, trim levels included S , SE , and SEL . In the United Kingdom, trim levels were S , Match , Sport , and Escape . In Canada, trim levels were Trendline , Comfortline , and Highline with an optional sport package. In Russia and other markets, trim levels included Trend & Fun , Sport & Style , and Track & Field . European markets received an R-Line trim level beginning in 2010. The Trend & Fun specification offered a maximum approach angle of 18 degrees. Features included six airbags, ESP , Trailer Stability Program integrated with the ESP, ISOFIX child seat anchorages on the rear bench and electronic parking brake with auto hold function, RCD 210 radio with integrated CD player, semi automatic climate control system, four electric window lifts, electrically adjustable and heated outside mirrors, trip computer, RF remote control of central locking and various storage compartments and bins.

The Track & Field package featured a redesigned front module, with a 28-degree approach angle (instead of 18-degree), [ 24 ] hill descent assistant, modified driving pedal characteristic, EDS adaptation (electronic differential locks are activated at the slightest slip), ABS adaptation (which aids with braking on loose substrates), hill ascent assistance, automatic transmission gear level pre-selection (including optimal engine braking effect), 16-inch alloy wheels, tire pressure indicator, black roof rails, engine underbody protection, compass display, special door impact guard strips and seats with adjustable lumbar support. China [ edit ] The import version of Tiguan appeared on the Chinese market in 2009, with a locally built version (aka Shanghai-Volkswagen Tiguan) debuting at 2009 Guangzhou Motor Show. The Chinese built Tiguan is LWB（2684mm）uses 1.8-litre TSI 160 PS (158 hp; 118 kW) and 2.0-litre TSI 200 PS (197 hp; 147 kW), and has a revised front fascia. At the same time, the import Tiguan is still sold in China, which has 2.0 TSI and R-Line kit as highlights. The basic design of the import model is the same as the international one. Due to the regulations, Shanghai-VW Tiguan is given a Chinese name, known as 途观 (tiguan), and the import one keeps the original letter name to differ locally built and import models. Since the launch of the second generation Tiguan, the first generation Tiguan continued to be sold in China as the Tiguan Silk Road until it was discontinued in 2020. [ 25 ] Volkswagen Tiguan (China, pre-facelift Rear 2014 Volkswagen Tiguan (China) North America [ edit ] 2010 Volkswagen Tiguan (United States) The Tiguan was launched in United States and Canada in May 2008 for the 2009 model year. [ 26 ] It was powered by a direct-injected and turbocharged 200 PS (197 hp; 147 kW) 2.0-litre petrol engine. [ 27 ] Imported from Germany, Volkswagen of America had positioned the first generation Tiguan as a niche product due to its high price tag impacted by a crippling dollar-euro exchange, with annual sales of 20,000 to 25,000 units. [ 28 ] As the result, sales were proved lackluster compared to its rivals, with only 175,606 Tiguans sold in the United States between 2008 and 2015. [ 29 ] Tiguan Limited (2017–2018) [ edit ] In April 2017, Volkswagen of America announced that it would continue to sell its outgoing Tiguan alongside the second generation model, rebranding it as the Volkswagen Tiguan Limited. Due to slow sales compared to the second generation model, the Tiguan Limited was discontinued after the 2018 model year.

[ 34 ] The headlights were made bolder and more angular, and the prominent horizontal grille bars of the Golf and new Passat were incorporated, as were the angular line design in the two-part taillight clusters. Performance was also enhanced. The interior trim was revised with an updated three spoke steering wheel and gear selector. [ 35 ] Pre-facelift styling Front (Track & Field) Front Rear Post-facelift styling Front (Track & Field/USA) Front Rear HyMotion [ edit ] At the November 2007 Michelin Challenge Bibendum , in Shanghai , China, Volkswagen showed the Tiguan HyMotion study powered by a hydrogen fuel cell . [ 36 ] The fuel cell produces 80 kW (107 hp) which, when combined with energy stored in the battery, allows the electric motor to output a total of 100 kW (134 hp). These figures allow the Tiguan HyMotion to reach a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph) and accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in about 14 seconds. The 6.8 ampere hour lithium-ion battery can be charged by the fuel cell or by recovered braking energy. Power output from the lithium-ion battery is 22 kW (30 hp).

[ 44 ] It was initially revealed in its short-wheelbase guise, which is 50 kg (110 lb) lighter than the outgoing Tiguan, while also 60 mm (2.4 in) longer, 30 mm (1.2 in) wider, and its wheelbase is extended by 77 mm (3.0 in). As a result, VW claimed interior space has been improved, with rear passengers having 29 mm (1.1 in) more knee room. Furthermore, the rear bench seat is asymmetrically split and can be adjusted up to 180 mm (7.1 in) longitudinally. [ 45 ] The Tiguan Mk2 is available in two wheelbase variants: a short-wheelbase (SWB) version (referred to as "normal wheelbase" (NWB) by Volkswagen) [ 7 ] seating up to five passengers; and a long-wheelbase (LWB) version with standard (or optional in some market) third-row seats, seating up to seven passengers. The latter was revealed in March 2017, offering 109 mm (4.3 in) longer wheelbase and the 215 mm (8.5 in) longer body. [ 46 ] In some markets where the Tiguan is sold in both SWB and LWB variants, the LWB Tiguan is sold as the Tiguan Allspace or Tiguan L (in China). The LWB version is manufactured in Mexico to supply worldwide markets (except China), with some countries importing them as knock-down kits . [ 47 ] The LWB Tiguan will be succeeded by the Tayron Mk2 , except in China where the Mk3 Tiguan is offered in a sole LWB version called the Tiguan L Pro.
