[ 1 ] It features the first implementation of XPeng's LiDAR -less 'vision only' autonomous driving system. Overview [ edit ] Rear view The P7+ is designed to be a larger, cheaper version of the XPeng P7i , which it will be sold alongside rather than replace. It significantly increases the spaciousness of the second row, which was a significant criticism of the P7 series. Weeks before its public reveal, P7+ units were spotted being stockpiled outside of the XPeng Guangzhou factory, and some were spotted while being shipped to showrooms as display models and test drive units. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] The P7+ made its Chinese debut on October 10, 2024 and its international debut at the Paris Motor Show on October 14, which is also when Chinese market pre-orders opened. [ 4 ] The starting price of the P7+ at the pre-sale was CN¥ 209,800 ( US$ 29,600). By October 18, the first batch of production P7+ units had been produced and were in transit to showrooms. [ 5 ] Deliveries began in November, and production capacity had been increased three times by early December to meet demand, as the model achieved the 10,000 and 20,000 delivery milestones within one and two months of launch, respectively. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Battery supplier Eve Energy initially allocated three battery cell production lines to supply the P7+, which was quickly increased to four lines in November due to the model's high demand, and two additional lines will be allocated in January 2025. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] At launch, the P7+ will be available in two versions: Long Range Max, and Ultra Long Range Max. A special Limited Edition Max model, based on the Ultra Long Range trim with different 20-inch wheels, is produced only 500 units. [ 10 ] Unlike previous XPeng models, all trim levels have the same autonomous driving capabilities. Design and technology [ edit ] Despite the similar name to the P7i, the P7+ rides on the larger SEPA 2.0 platform shared with the G6 . While the wheelbase is about the same as the P7i, the overall length of the car is 168 mm (6.6 in) longer. The A-pillar has been moved forward closer to the front wheels, and the C-pillar moved rearward, increasing the length of the cabin. The rear hatch features a raised 'double-decker' fastback design, allowing for increased rear passenger headroom and taller cargo area while maintaining low aerodynamic drag. These changes allow for increased interior space, a significant criticism of the P7i. The P7+ is available in five exterior paint colors: New Moon Silver, Nebula White, Midnight Black, Twilight Purple, and Cloud Beige. [ 7 ] The chassis uses a double wishbone suspension at the front and a multilink independent suspension at the rear. The P7+ has a drag coefficient of 0.206, helped by the use of active grille shutters. Autonomous driving system [ edit ] The P7+ features XPeng's first implementation of a 'vision only' autonomous driving system. Named AI Hawk , it uses two Nvidia Orin X chips providing 508 TOPS of compute, along with a series of eleven cameras, three mmWave radars, and twelve ultrasonic sensors, but notably lacks LiDAR in its sensor suite unlike the P7i. It uses the industry's first implementation of single-pixel LOFIC (lateral overflow integration capacitor) camera sensors, which are better able to deal with high contrast lighting scenarios such as backlighting or headlight glare during nighttime; these sensors are used in the front and rear low- field-of-view cameras. [ 11 ] Interior [ edit ] The P7+ has a near buttonless dashboard, with nearly all controls placed in the 15.6-inch center infotainment touchscreen; the 10.25-inch digital instrument panel is controlled by two sets of button and scroll controls mounted on the two-spoke steering wheel, which are powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8295 SoC . Ahead of the center console armrest is a set of two cupholders and dual ventilated wireless charging pads. On the rear of the center console is a pair of vents and a touchscreen for the rear passengers. The touchscreen houses controls for the seats' heating, ventilation, and massage functions, controls for the rear climate control zone, and media controls with the ability to play videos. The front seatbacks contain a folding tray table similar to airline seats, and there are controls to move the front passenger seat forward to provide more legroom. Both the front and rear seats have heated, ventilated, and massaging seats available. The driver's seat has up to 12-way power seat adjustments, and the rear seatbacks can be power reclined by up to 10 degrees. The P7+ has a front seating space of 956 mm (37.6 in) and 994 mm (39.1 in) in the rear, with 157 mm (6.2 in) of knee room. The roof is spanned by a tinted 2.1-square-metre (23 sq ft) panoramic sunroof that lacks a sunshade. The XPeng-developed sound system consists of twenty Dynaudio -sourced speakers imported from Germany in a 7.1.4 surround sound configuration. It includes a speaker integrated into the driver's seat headrest which will provide audio from navigation prompts and phone calls without interrupting audio for the rest of the cabin. The P7+ has a power rear liftgate which reveals a trunk with 725 liters (192 U.S. gal) of space, which expands to 2,221 liters (587 U.S. gal) with the rear seats folded down. It also has an underfloor compartment, but lacks a frunk despite having an opening hood. 2025 update [ edit ] At Auto Shanghai 2025 in April, XPeng revealed the 2025 update for the P7+. The biggest change is to the Ultra Long Range Flagship trim, which has been updated with a new battery to support 5C charging speeds to charge from 10‍–‍80% in 12 minutes. The flagship trim also now comes with continuous damping control and new hydraulic bushings, and has new 20-inch wheel options. The two other trims including the older Ultra Long Range continue unchanged. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Powertrain [ edit ] The P7+ comes with a choice of two lithium iron phosphate batteries of either 60.7 kWh or 76.3 kWh capacities, sourced from Eve Power . The battery packs have a height of 109 mm (4.3 in), which XPeng claims are the world's thinnest. [ 14 ] Both batteries use an 800 V electrical platform using silicon carbide power electronics, and support up to 3C charging resulting in a claimed 30‍–‍80% charge time of 16 minutes. The P7+ comes with a single 180 kW (241 hp; 245 PS) motor standard, with higher models receiving a single 230 kW (308 hp; 313 PS) unit, both produced by XPeng in Wuhan. It has a top speed of 200 kilometres per hour (124 mph). [ 15 ] An OTA update expected to release in December 2024 will increase the maximum range of the P7+ from 602 to 615 km (374 to 382 mi) for the smaller battery, and from 710 to 725 km (441 to 450 mi) for the larger pack. [ 16 ] The updated Flagship trim in 2025 comes with a Eve Energy-supplied 74.9 kWh LFP battery pack capable of 5C charging from 10‍–‍80% within 12 minutes, and a maximum range of 685 km (426 mi). [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Powertrains Model Year Battery Power Torque Range (CLTC) 10‍–‍80% charge time 0–100 km/h (62 mph) time Long Range 2024– 60.7 kWh LFP 180 kW (241 hp; 245 PS) 450 N⋅m (332 lb⋅ft) 602–615 km (374–382 mi) 20 mins 6.8 s Ultra Long Range 76.3 kWh LFP 230 kW (308 hp; 313 PS) 685–715 km (426–444 mi) 5.9 s Ultra Long Range Flagship 2025– 74.9 kWh LFP 685 km (426 mi) 12 mins Sales [ edit ] At launch in China, customers could put down a refundable CN¥ 99 (approximately US$ 14) pre-order deposit which would provide a CN¥ 3,000 (approximately US$ 420) total purchase discount, leading to 30,000 pre-orders only 1 hour and 48 minutes after opening. XPeng later announced that there were 31,528 firm orders during the November 7 launch day, breaking the brand's record. XPeng chairman He Xiaopeng said on social media that over 10,000 firm orders for the P7+ were placed within 12 minutes after opening. [ 4 ] [ 14 ] On November 28, 2024 at a celebratory ceremony, XPeng announced that they have produced the 10,000th P7+ 20 days after its launch earlier that month on the 7th; deliveries began on November 11. [ 17 ] Weeks later on December 11, Xpeng announced that it delivered their 10,000th P7+. [ 6 ] On January 10, 2025 Xpeng announced that it delivered the 20,000th P7+. [ 7 ] XPeng announced that it had produced the 50,000th P7+ on 28 April 2025. [ 18 ] Year China 2024 17,507 [ 19 ] References [ edit ] ^ Bobylev, Denis (2024-10-10).
