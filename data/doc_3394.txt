From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Woodworking tool for layout and point marking Scratch awl A scratch awl is a woodworking layout and point-making tool. It is used to scribe a line to be followed by a hand saw or chisel when making woodworking joints and other operations. [ 1 ] The scratch awl is a steel spike with its tip sharpened to a fine point. The tip of the spike is drawn across the timber, leaving a shallow groove . It may also be used to mark a point by pressing the tip into the timber. [ 2 ] It is generally used when dimensioning and for laying out with the grain. It may also be used across the grain.  However, a marking knife is preferred for this operation. [ 1 ] Scratch awls are traditionally used in leather crafting to trace patterns onto leather. [ 3 ] They are sometimes used in the automotive and sheet metal trades to punch holes and scribe lines in sheet metal.
