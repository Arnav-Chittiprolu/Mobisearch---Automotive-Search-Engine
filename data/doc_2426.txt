With a majority of its shares owned by Singaporean multinational transport conglomerate ComfortDelGro Corporation at 75%, it was formerly known as Singapore Bus Services before rebranding to SBS Transit on 1 November 2001. It is the largest public bus operator in Singapore, as well as one of the two major operators of Singapore's rail services along with SMRT Corporation . It has a fleet of 3,329 buses and operates 196 routes, as of 2024. [ 2 ] History [ edit ] Singapore Bus Services (1973‍–‍2001) [ edit ] 1973‍–‍1978 [ edit ] Main article: Public buses of Singapore § 1970s: Bus reorganization and mergers Singapore Bus Services Limited was established on 1 July 1973 when the regional bus companies Amalgamated Bus Company, Associated Bus Services and United Bus Company (which were in turn results of amalgamations of privately run Chinese bus companies of the 1960s in 1971) agreed to merge their operations with each taking shareholdings of 53%, 19% and 28% respectively in the new company. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The government-sanctioned merger was undertaken to improve service standards of the bus transport system. SBS inherited many problems from its Chinese predecessors, including use of 14 non-standard bus models that frequently broke down, poor standards among the staff and inadequate infrastructure. Hence, the government seconded a Government Team of Officials to SBS in 1974 to overhaul the management and culture. [ 6 ] Under the supervision of the GTO, SBS completely overhauled their bus fleet with new buses of usually the Albion Viking or Mercedes-Benz OF1413 makes and introduced a rigorous maintenance regime, improving the reliability of their buses greatly whereas a new disciplinary code was introduced, reducing complaints by half from 1979 to 1983. [ 7 ] In 1977, SBS introduced into service its first double-decker buses , the Leyland Atlantean AN68 on route 86 between Tampines Way and Shenton Way . [ 8 ] In light of dissatisfaction over bus services in the Jurong area and requests for improved coverage, SBS started a reorganisation of bus services across the country, starting with Jurong. This consisted of a network of internal services serving a town, with external services terminating at a point in the town, along with bus interchanges to serve as such termini. Additional depots were also constructed, which SBS claimed gave them more control over bus operations. [ 9 ] 1978‍–‍2001 [ edit ] The company was replaced by the Singapore Bus Service (1978) Limited on 17 February 1978. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] In May 1978, the company implemented a rule that car owners are were not allowed to purchases any shares, resulting in more than 5,000 applicants being unsuccessful. The stock was oversubscribed by about 27 times, with S$ 375 million received for 14 million shares at S$ 1.00 each. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The company was listed on the Stock Exchange of Singapore (SES) on 26 June 1978. [ 14 ] In 1992, SBS were reorganised under a new subsidiary SBS Bus Services Pte Ltd. [ 11 ] On 12 November 1997, the original Singapore Bus Services (1978) Limited was renamed DelGro Corporation , with SBS Bus Services Pte Ltd listed separately as Singapore Bus Services Limited on 10 December that year. [ 15 ] SBS also operated taxis as SBS Taxis. SBS Taxis merged with Singapore Commuter and Singapore Airport Bus Services on 1 July 1995 to form CityCab, which remained part of DelGro Corporation. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] SBS also operated Airbus in the past from 1995 to 1997 and Premium Bus Services, Sentosa Services and Jurong Island Services called "SBS Leisure" in 1995 to 2003. SBS had transferred Sentosa and Jurong Island Services in 2003, and Premium Bus Services (555 and 556) in December 2003 to private bus operators. 555 was a bus service from Watten Estate to Spottiswoode Park and 556 was a bus service from Sunset Way to Shenton Way, but it was totally withdrawn on 31 October 2004.

In addition, bus tenders for Choa Chu Kang and Bukit Batok bus services are awarded to TIBS. This move is also to cushion the impact with the rationalisation of bus services caused by Bukit Panjang LRT in 1999, as well as to reduce congestion in depots (Bus 61, 67, 106 and 172).

[ 11 ] On 29 March 2003, DelGro Corporation merged with Comfort Group to form ComfortDelGro Corporation . [ 11 ] [ 21 ] ComfortDelGro Corporation owns 75% of the shares in SBS Transit. On 18 January 2003, SBS Transit commenced operating the Sengkang LRT, followed by the North East MRT line on 20 June the same year. [ 22 ] SBS Transit commenced operating the Punggol LRT on 29 January 2005, followed by the Downtown MRT line on 22 December 2013. [ 23 ] Bus [ edit ] Routes [ edit ] SBS Transit had operated the majority of routes in almost all towns of Singapore with the notable exception of Tuas , Joo Koon, Jurong West , Jurong East , Tengah , Bukit Batok , Choa Chu Kang , Bukit Panjang , Woodlands , Sembawang , Yishun , Punggol and Pasir Ris , where most routes were under SMRT Buses (Woodlands Bus Package, Choa Chu Kang-Bukit Panjang Bus Package & Jurong West Bus Package), Tower Transit (Bulim Bus Package & Sembawang-Yishun Bus Package) and Go-Ahead (Loyang Bus Package). As of 2025, there are 222 wheelchair-accessible bus services that SBS Transit operates. SBS Transit later became the first local operator to win a tender under the BCM in April 2017, and began operating the Seletar Bus Package on 18 March 2018. [ 24 ] It was announced in 2018 by LTA that SBS Transit had won the subsequent package, the Bukit Merah Bus Package. [ 25 ] In 2023, it was announced that SBS Transit retained the Bukit Merah Bus Package for its second term, but lost the bid for Jurong West Bus Package, which was awarded to SMRT Buses . [ 26 ] In July 2024, it was announced that SBS Transit retained the Seletar Bus Package for its second term. [ 27 ] In September 2025, it was announced that SBS Transit lost the bid for Tampines Bus Package, which was awarded to Go-Ahead . Bus service were also introduced Express Feeder bus service 454 and 456. Bus service 454 also lost 1 express feeder and was also awarded to Go-Ahead Singapore. While the only Express feeder bus service was service 456.

SBS Transit purchased 12 Volgren -bodied CNG Volvo B10BLE buses. When SBS was first formed in 1973, it inherited a wide variety of buses of various makes from its Chinese predecessors. Examples of such buses included the Albion Viking , Mercedes-Benz LP1113 and OF1413 and Nissan Diesel RX102K3 with small numbers of Ford R192 and 226 , Seddon , Fargo-Kew , Bedford and Austin . [ 31 ] Most of these buses were bodied by local coachbuilder Soon Chow although some were bodied by other companies such as Supreme Star and Strachan. [ 32 ] Subsequent models that were purchased by SBS included Berliet and Guy Victory in the 1970s and the Volvo B57 and Mercedes-Benz OF1417 in the 1980s, the latter which were bodied by foreign coachbuilders like New Zealand Motor Bodies and Hawke Coachwork . [ 31 ] In 1976, SBS purchased its first 20 Leyland Atlantean AN68 buses to evaluate the suitability of double-decker bus operation, with the buses first entering service on bus 86 on 13 June 1977. [ 31 ] Following the success of the trial, SBS ordered another 500 Leyland Atlantean AN68 buses from 1978 to 1984, all of which were either bodied by Metal Sections or Walter Alexander Coachbuilders ; SBS also conducted comparative trials of double-decker buses of other makes, namely the Leyland Olympian , Volvo Ailsa B55 , Scania BR112DH , Dennis Dominator , Dennis Trident 3 , Mercedes-Benz O305 and Volvo B10MD Citybus . [ 33 ] In 1984, SBS purchased another 200 Leyland Olympian and 200 Mercedes-Benz O305 double-decker buses. [ 33 ] SBS also conducted an evaluation of air conditioned buses (namely the ex-Singapore Airport Bus Services Mercedes-Benz OF1413 coaches) that year and conducted similar trials with other bus models like the Nissan Diesel U31S and Renault PR100 (SBS30P) before its first bulk order for 50 Scania N113CRB buses in 1989. [ 31 ] [ 33 ] In the 1990s, some bus models on the roads included the Volvo B10M , Scania N113CRB , Mercedes-Benz O405 , Leyland and Volvo Olympian and Dennis Dart . [ 34 ] SBS also conducted trials of high capacity single decker buses, namely a superlong Volvo B10M Mark IV (SBS997A), an articulated Volvo B10MA (SBS998Y) and an articulated Mercedes-Benz O405G (SBS999U), in 1996 although the trial did not succeed. [ 33 ] The first low-floor bus , a Volgren -bodied Volvo Super Olympian demonstrator (SBS9888Y) was brought to SBS by Volvo Buses for trial purposes in 1999. After its successful trial, 51 Volvo Super Olympian chassis were further brought in by SBS Transit. 50 buses are bodied by Volgren between 2002 and 2003 while 1 remaining chassis is being reserved for a ComfortDelGro Engineering bodywork, which entered revenue service by 2005. The first wheelchair-accessible bus was also brought into service in 2006. SBS Transit compressed natural gas buses began service in 2002. Hybrid and electric buses came into foray since 2019, although small-scale trials began in 2010. Between 2020 and 2021, one unit of Mercedes-Benz Citaro C2 Hybrid, SG4004B, was brought in for trial purposes and was loaned from Daimler South East Asia under a Special Purpose License. The bus was on revenue service from 9 March 2020 to 8 March 2021 on buses 93 & 272 with SBS Transit based at the Ulu Pandan Bus Depot (UPDEP). All Volvo B10BLE CNG (rigid) buses were retired in 2019 except for the first two units which had been preserved, after that, both Volvo B10TLs and Volvo B9TL CDGEs were retired early and scrapped. Only 20 Volvo B9TL CDGE buses remained in operation until September 2023 when they reached the end of their lifespan, with the last day of service being 22 September. [ 35 ] In March 2024, several units of the Scania K230UB (Euro IV and V) buses were transferred to SMRT Buses from SBS Transit for some testings at Woodlands Depot before the Jurong West Bus Package begins operations in September that year. In October 2021, Alexander Dennis Enviro500 MMC with 3-door and 2-staircase buses was usually enter service debut on bus 974. new bearing Enviro500 MkIV bodywork type and shares with the Enviro400 MMC exterior design, such as new feature for Hong Kong. In 2025, All these electric buses were began operating service debuts to replace with the traditional diesel EEV buses. Rail [ edit ] Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) [ edit ] SBS Transit operates two of Singapore's six MRT lines in the network, the North East Line (NEL) since its opening on 20 June 2003 and the Downtown Line (DTL) since its opening on 22 December 2013. [ 36 ] SBS Transit is also set to operate the Jurong Region Line (JRL) as a joint venture alongside French rail operator RATP Dev under the operator name Singapore One Rail when it opens in 2027. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] The NEL currently spans 21.6 km and 17 stations, running from HarbourFront in the south-west to Punggol Coast in the north-east. As of 2023, the NEL uses a fleet composed of three very similar series of 49 Alstom Metropolis train-sets, namely the C751A , C751C and C851E . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] The operating license for the NEL was awarded to SBS Transit in order to foster competition with SMRT Trains and to create multi-modal public transport companies, each specialising in their own district. In 2018, it was confirmed that SBS Transit's contract for maintaining the NEL would last until 31 March 2033. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] The NEL was Singapore's third metro line and the city's first automated and driverless system. At times, it has been referred to as "the first driverless heavy metro line in the world" or the "world's first fully automated and driverless high-capacity rapid transit line" by some. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] While driverless metro systems have existed long before (notably the Lille Metro since 1983, the Vancouver Skytrain since 1985 and the Kelana Jaya Line and Paris Métro Line 14 since 1998), the NEL is the first application of a fully automated and driverless metro system with heavy rail characteristics such as an overhead catenary (in contrast to earlier systems using third rail ) and 1,435 mm standard-gauge (in contrast to earlier systems featuring smaller rail profiles). Till today, it is the only MRT line in Singapore using the overhead catenary electrical system while the rest of Singapore's MRT uses the third rail. The DTL currently spans 41.9 km and 35 stations as of 2025, running from Bukit Panjang station in the north-west to Expo station in the east via the Central Area . The DTL is fully automated and driverless as well and consists of a fleet of 92 Bombardier Movia C951 trainsets.

Light Rail Transit (LRT) [ edit ] Out of three LRT lines in Singapore, two are operated and maintained by SBS Transit, namely the Sengkang LRT line and Punggol LRT line (SPLRT). These lines serve a total of 29 stations and provide feeder connections to Sengkang and Punggol stations. As of 2025, these lines use a fleet of 57 sets comprising two series of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Crystal Mover APMs (namely the C810 and C810A [ 46 ] ), a number expected to increase in the future with the introduction of C810D APMs. [ 47 ] In 2018, it was confirmed that SBS Transit's contract for both LRT lines would run until 31 March 2033.

Depots [ edit ] Out of ten operational rail depots in Singapore, SBS Transit maintains three, namely: Sengkang Depot which houses NEL and SPLRT trains. The depot is undergoing an expansion program which is targeted for completion in 2027 in order to accommodate more trains, after being in operation since 2003. Tai Seng Facility Building which houses some DTL trains. Gali Batu Depot which houses the majority of DTL trains. It has undergone expansion towards the end of 2010s. East Coast Integrated Depot which is expected to house DTL trains upon its opening in 2026.
