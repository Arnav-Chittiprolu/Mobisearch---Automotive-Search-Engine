Classical and modern history [ edit ] Krishnagiri region is a part of the ancient Kongu Nadu and Chera country. Historically it was ruled by Chera rulers. Later the region came under Cholas , Pallavas , Gangas, Nulambas , Hoysalas , Vijaya Nagar and Bijapur emperors, Wodeyars of Mysore and Nayaks of Madurai. This region of Krishnagiri served as "Gateway of Tamil Nadu" and the protective barrier for the southern region defending onslaughts from invaders with motives of imperialism and exploitation. Krishnagiri Fort become the first and foremost defensive place. The majestic fortress, built on Krishnagiri hill by the Vijaya Nagar emperors, stands as testimony still now. During Mysore war I , the British troops passed through Krishnagiri to attack Hyder Ali 's Forces at Kaveripattinam . British army was defeated here.
