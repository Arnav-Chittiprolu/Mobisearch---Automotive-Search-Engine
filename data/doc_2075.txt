=== Origins ===
{{Main|Hummer}}
The GMC Hummer EV originated from the discontinued [[Hummer]] brand that was founded by [[AM General]], the manufacturer of the original [[Humvee|HUMVEE light military vehicle]] that was later adapted to civilian spec and sold to the public as the [[Hummer H1]]. In 1999, General Motors purchased the rights to the Hummer name and began marketing it as a full-fledged brand with a lineup that eventually included the [[Hummer H2]] and [[Hummer H3]]. The Hummer brand was discontinued in 2010 following the [[General Motors bankruptcy]].
