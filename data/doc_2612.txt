From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Filter used to strain fuel in fuel systems Fuel filter (small cylinder in white) for a tractor engine Fuel filter (in white) in a 1982 GMC Sierra Fuel filter for diesel Volkswagen car engines A fuel filter is a filter used to screen out foreign particles or liquids from the fuel. Most internal combustion engines use a fuel filter, in order to protect the components in the fuel system. Filters for foreign particles [ edit ] Unfiltered fuel may contain several kinds of contamination, for example paint chips and dirt that has entered the fuel tank while filling, or rust caused by moisture in a steel tank. [ citation needed ] If these substances are not removed before the fuel enters the system, they will cause rapid wear and failure of the fuel pump and injectors. [ 1 ] The filters are normally made into cartridges containing a filter paper . [ citation needed ] Fuel filters need to be maintained or replaced at regular intervals. Filters for foreign liquids [ edit ] Some diesel engines use a bowl-like design to collect water in the bottom of the filter (as diesel floats on top of water). [ citation needed ] The water can then be drained off by opening a valve in the bottom of the bowl and letting it run out, until only the fuel remains.
