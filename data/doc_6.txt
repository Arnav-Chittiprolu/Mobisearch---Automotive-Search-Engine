Citroën The Citroën ELO is the French automaker's latest concept, and it's described as a "laboratory of ideas." The minivan with a strange roof features a central driving position like a McLaren F1 , with enough room to seat six passengers or sleep two. The ELO isn't intended for production, but it provides an interesting glimpse at what the French think an adventure-centric van can be. Citroën may not be the first brand that Americans think of when considering anything but complicated suspensions, but the French brand is still going strong in its home market with a wide variety of hatchbacks, crossovers, and vans. Most of those cars are fairly conventional. Still, the lineup has room for funky things like the Ami quadricycle Fiat uses as the base for the Topolino . Now, the brand's latest concept imagines something far funkier than even that. CITROEN This unusually shaped van is called the Citroën ELO, which inexplicably stands for "Rest, Play, and Work" by taking the second letter from each word. That may not be how abbreviations work, but it is a fittingly strange name for a van with a roof that looks wierd in at least three distinct ways.

It seats between four and six in an odd arrangement, with a McLaren F1-style central driving seat that can pivot around to face the rest of the car's seats when not operating. The brand says that the ELO also sleeps two, functions as a power supply, and serves as a "home cinema room." CITROEN If the ELO were to reach production in anything like this form, all of that would be an attractive collection of traits for a small van that would be at home in both the city and a campsite near you. For now, Citroën says the concept is just a "laboratory of ideas" meant to showcase the brand's interest in strange new forms of innovation. Hopefully, that central swivel seat will live on in a van that actually reaches customers in the future.
