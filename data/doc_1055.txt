Respectively the six and seventh generation Passat, and internally designated B6 and B7 , they were marketed in sedan and wagon bodystyles in front-wheel as well as all-wheel drive configurations, with a range of petrol and diesel engines. Unlike its predecessor, the B6 Passat no longer shared its platform with Audi's equivalent model (the Audi A4 ). Based on a modified version of the Mk5 Golf's PQ35 platform (PQ46), the B6 featured a transverse rather than longitudinal engine layout of its predecessor, like the previous B3 and B4 generations, which were related to the A2 (Golf) platform. The PQ46 platform provided increased torsional rigidity. The transverse-engine layout of the four-wheel drive version, marketed as 4Motion , dictated a switch from the Torsen centre differential of the B5, to the Haldex Traction multi-plate clutch . The change to the Haldex system also changes the handling closer to a front-wheel drive car. Compared to the Torsen, the Haldex can direct torque more unequally to the front wheels (from 100:0 to 50:50 front-to-rear bias), thus providing a wider bias range than the 75:25 to 25:75 of the B5 Passat. Haldex is a reactive-type system, behaving as a front-wheel-drive vehicle until slippage is detected, at which point up to a maximum of 50% of the torque can be transmitted to the rear axle. See the Audi -related quattro (four-wheel-drive system) article for more information. The B6 debuted at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2005, and launched in Europe in the summer of 2005, using a long-wheelbase version of the fifth-generation Golf and Jetta , along with a transverse engine layout. B6 Passats were marketed globally, and superseded in North America by a model exclusively manufactured at Volkswagen's Chattanooga Assembly Plant . VW debuted the B7 facelift at the Paris Motor Show in September 2010 and continued to market B7 models globally outside North America. [ 2 ] In Asia, the PQ46 Passat was released by FAW-VW as the Magotan , after Volkswagen's other joint venture Shanghai Volkswagen had decided to continue using the B5 platform for the Passat and the Passat Lingyu (long-wheelbase Passat). [ 3 ] Since August 2010, the wagon version of Passat B6 was available in Asia, which is a fully imported model. But this car is simply called Volkswagen Variant in China, in order not to refer the name "Passat" or "Magotan". Notable variations included the Passat CC , a sedan variant with revised styling, along with the R36 variant, featuring the VR6 engine. The all-wheel drive version, marketed as 4Motion , uses a Haldex Traction multi-plate clutch . A B7 all wheel drive wagon was marketed as the Alltrack and sedan and wagons were also marketed in China. A driverless version of the Passat Wagon finished second in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge . [ 4 ] In spring 2015, Swiss telecommunications company Swisscom tested the driverless Volkswagen Passat on the streets of Zürich . [ 5 ] Saloon (pre-facelift) Variant (pre-facelift) Interior (pre-facelift) Notable variations [ edit ] Passat R36 [ edit ] At the Frankfurt Motor Show in September 2007, Volkswagen launched the 'R Line' R36, created by Volkswagen Individual GmbH. [ 6 ] The R36 uses a 3.6 litre VR6 engine rated 221 kW ; 296 bhp (300 PS ) and 350 N⋅m (258 lbf⋅ft ) of torque, which pushes the saloon and Variant (estate/wagon) to 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 5.6 and 5.8 seconds respectively. The name "R36" is derived from the engine displacement, 3.6-litres. The R36 features redesigned front and rear spoilers, four wheel drive, DSG gearbox with paddleshift on the flat-bottom steering wheel, 18" Omanyt aluminium alloy wheels, 20 mm (0.8 in) lowered suspension, 'R' engraved stainless steel pedals, Recaro seats with R36 logo, heated front and rear seats, Bi-Xenon headlights with cornering function, and twin rear muffler tailpipes. Saloon (front) Saloon (back) Variant Passat CC [ edit ] Main article: Volkswagen CC The CC ("Comfort Coupé") [ 7 ] is a 4-door "coupé" version of the Passat. It debuted at the 2008 North American International Auto Show in Detroit . Originally aimed at competing with the similarly styled Mercedes CLS, the Passat CC intends to be more stylish and luxurious than the previously released Passat B6. In the U.S., the name "Passat" was dropped, and the car is being sold as "CC". [ 8 ] Some options specific to the CC include hands-free parking, lane-departure prevention, intelligent cruise control, and adaptive suspension. Engines offered in the CC mirror those of the regular Passat, with options of the base 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder, or the optional 3.6-liter V-6, which includes 4-motion all wheel drive. Although the CC is marketed as a more luxurious Passat B6, it comes in with a lower price tag. While the MSRP of a Passat B6 is $29,300, the CC comes with a base price of $27,100. [ citation needed ] The Chinese-made CC was released by FAW-VW on July 15, 2010. Two engine options are provided: 1.8T and 2.0T. [ 9 ] Volkswagen facelifted the Passat CC in late 2011 for the 2012 year, with styling updates akin to those of the larger Phaeton . For the updated model, Volkswagen has dropped the Passat name for all markets, now matching the Volkswagen CC branding used since 2008 in North America .

The B7 facelift revised all external body panels (except roof and glasshouse), a revised grille and headlights, and minor changes to the interior. Overall height and width dimensions remained unchanged, while the length was increased by 4 mm. New features include Adaptive Chassis Control (DCC), Dynamic Light Assist glare-free high beams , a fatigue detection system and an automatic " city emergency braking " system. [ 12 ] Saloon (facelift) Variant (facelift) Variant (facelift) Interior (facelift) Passat Alltrack [ edit ] In October 2010, the Passat Alltrack debuted at the 2010 Tokyo Motor Show , bridges the gap between Volkswagen passenger car and SUV ranges. The Passat Alltrack has raised ground clearance from 135 to 165 mm which improves approach angle from 13.5 to 16 degrees, departure angle from 11.9 to 13.6 degrees and ramp angle from 9.5 to 12.8 degrees when compared to the standard Passat wagon. Passat Alltrack is the only VW in the passenger range to offer 4Motion with off-road driving programme, the off-road system works in conjunction with the ABS, electronic differential lock (EDL), DSG and hill descent assist system to control the vehicle in an off-road expedition. The engine range of the Passat Alltrack consists of two 2.0 L TDI with outputs of 103 kW/140 hp and 125 kW/170 hp and two petrol engines, 1.8 L producing 118 kW/160 hp and 2.0 L TSI producing 155 kW/207 hp. The TDI models come standard with BlueMotion Technology packages with Stop/Start system and battery regeneration mode for recovering braking energy. The two lesser powered engine variants 2.0 L TDI and 1.8 L TSI are only available in front wheel drive format with a manual 6 speed transmission. The rest of the range with 4Motion has a 6 speed DSG automated manual transmission, except the 2.0 L TDI with 103 kW/140 hp has an option of 6 speed manual. [ citation needed ] Front Back China [ edit ] Main article: Volkswagen Magotan In China, the PQ46 Passat was released by FAW-Volkswagen ( Volkswagen Group China subsidiary FAW-Volkswagen (FAW-VW) as the Magotan since July 2007, after Volkswagen's other joint venture in China, Shanghai Volkswagen Automotive (SVW), had decided to use the B5 platform for the Passat and the Passat Lingyu (long-wheelbase Passat). [ 13 ] Since August 2010 the wagon version of Passat B6 will be offered in China, which is a fully imported model. But this car is simply called Volkswagen Variant in China, in order not to refer the name "Passat" or "Magotan". In China, the FAW-VW -built Magotan was also replaced by a long-wheelbase version of the Passat B7. The new model will be exclusive to the Chinese market, and at least 100 mm longer than the European B7. [ 14 ] Engines available for Magotan B7L are ranging from 1.4-litre T, 1.8-litre T to 2.0-litre T, a special-developed EA390 3.0-litre VR6 FSI [ 15 ] engine is opted for the top model. Malaysia [ edit ] On December 21, 2010 an agreement to assemble Volkswagen vehicles in Malaysia was signed between DRB-Hicom and Volkswagen AG, which followed the MOU signed by both parties in August of that year aimed at investigating the possibility of local vehicle production. The first locally assembled VW model to be rolled out from DRB-Hicom's Pekan plant in Pahang state, Malaysia, was the Volkswagen Passat in 2012. [ 16 ] Engines [ edit ] Fuel Stratified Injection is used in nearly every petrol engined version of the Passat, ranging from 1.6 to 3.6 litres (the 1.6-litre DOHC can reach 100 km/h (62.1 mph) in 11.5 seconds, and 200 km/h (124.3 mph) for manual transmission versions), and the multi-valve 2.0-litre Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) I4 diesel is available in both 140 PS (103 kW; 138 hp) and 170 PS (125 kW; 168 hp) variants. In the U.S. market, a 200 PS (147 kW; 197 hp) 2.0-litre turbocharged I4 was offered along with the 280 PS (206 kW; 276 hp) 3.6-litre VR6 engine , with six-speed manual (only available on the base 2.0 T model) and automatic transmissions . As of the 2009 model year, the VR6 engine and 4motion option were discontinued on US Passats.

The 1.8 TSI is rated at 160 PS (118 kW; 158 hp), 250 N⋅m (184 lbf⋅ft ) and reaches 0–100 km/h (62 mph) in 8.6 seconds, reaching a top speed of 220 km/h (136.7 mph). This engine is part of the wider Volkswagen Group policy for engine sharing. As at August 2008, the cars were advertised in the UK as Euro 4 emission class . [ 21 ] By July 2009, this had changed to Euro 5 class. [ 22 ] This coincides with the introduction of the EA189 engine family at the centre of the VW emissions violation situation that became public in September 2015.
