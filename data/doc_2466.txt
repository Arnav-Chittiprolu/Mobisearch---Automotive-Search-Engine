Cheers.— InternetArchiveBot ( Report bug ) 03:01, 24 September 2017 (UTC) [ reply ] Cellulosic ethanol [ edit ] The article’s references to cellulosic ethanol frame it as a subject of contemporary research and interest.  I find this framing somewhat problematic as the references cited on the subject are from 2009 or earlier.  Is it valid to indicate cellulosic ethanol science as the current state of research when references are more than 10 years old? Hithigon ( talk ) 00:29, 23 February 2021 (UTC) [ reply ] Good point.  Please see the updated section. Sandcherry ( talk ) 17:00, 23 February 2021 (UTC) [ reply ] The environmental implications are not fully discussed. Many sources suggest it is not a net benefit, and may be an actual harm, and that’s without considering the vast amount of natural wilderness lost or potentially lost to farmland, a very big harm. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 2601:645:C601:6010:8937:1975:D181:D614 ( talk ) 00:46, 20 December 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Retrieved from " https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Ethanol_fuel&oldid=1264025611 " Categories : Former good article nominees B-Class Environment articles High-importance Environment articles Green vehicle task force articles B-Class Climate change articles High-importance Climate change articles WikiProject Climate change articles B-Class energy articles Mid-importance energy articles B-Class Automobile articles Mid-importance Automobile articles Hidden categories: Wikipedia pages using copied template Wikipedia pages using merged-from template without oldid
