[ 1 ] Since the Volkswagen Group is German, official internal combustion engine performance ratings are published using the International System of Units (commonly abbreviated "SI"), a modern form of the metric system of figures. Motor vehicle engines will have been tested by a Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN) accredited testing facility, to either the original 80/1269/ EEC , or the later 1999/99/ EC standards. [ citation needed ] The standard initial measuring unit for establishing the rated motive power output is the kilowatt (kW); [ citation needed ] and in their official literature, the power rating may be published in either the kW, or the metric horsepower (often abbreviated "PS" for the German word Pferdestärke ), or both, and may also include conversions to imperial units such as the horsepower (hp) or brake horsepower (bhp). ( Conversions : one PS = 735.5 watts (W); ˜ 0.98632 hp (SAE)). In case of conflict, the metric power figure of kilowatts (kW) will be stated as the primary figure of reference. For the turning force generated by the engine, the Newton metre (Nm) will be the reference figure of torque . Furthermore, in accordance with European automotive traditions, engines shall be listed in the following ascending order of preference: [ citation needed ] Number of cylinders, Engine displacement (in litres ), Engine configuration, and Rated motive power output (in kilowatts). The petrol engines which Volkswagen Group previously manufactured and installed are in the list of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines article. This transport-related list is incomplete ; you can help by adding missing items . ( October 2021 ) Nomenclature [ edit ] Both vehicle and engine platforms developed by Volkswagen are specified internally as an Entwicklungsauftrag ("EA"), or development assignment . The numbers denoting a particular Entwicklungsauftrag don't follow a strictly chronological scheme but have generally increased over time. EA211 R3/R4 [ edit ] Main article: Volkswagen EA211 engine The EA211 engines are a completely new four-cylinder turbocharged and direct-injection TSI engines. Compared to its predecessor, the EA211 series is significantly more compact, with installation length 50 mm (2.0 in) shorter, thus offering more interior space. The installation position of the engines has also been optimised. Just as in the diesels, the petrol engines are now mounted with the exhaust side facing backwards and tilted at an angle of 12 degrees. The weight of these petrol engines made of die-cast aluminium is only 97 kg (214 lb) for the 1.2 TSI and 106 kg (234 lb) for the 1.4 TSI. The crankshaft alone became lighter by 20 per cent; the connecting rods lost 30 per cent of their weight. In addition the connecting rod bearing journals are now hollow-drilled and pistons now come with flat bottoms, all of them optimized for lower weight.
Regarding thermal management, the EA211 petrol engine is equipped with a modern dual-circuit cooling system. That means that a high temperature circuit with a mechanically driven cooling pump cools the basic engine, while a low temperature circuit flows through the intercooler and the turbo-charger casing. The cylinder-head circuit heats the cabin's interior. The exhaust manifold is integrated into the cylinder head, enabling the engine to warm up more quickly, in turn making heat available quickly for the passenger cabin. At high loads, the exhaust is cooled by the coolant, lowering fuel consumption. 1.0 R3 inline-three 12v [ edit ] The new fuel-saving engine presented at the 2012 Geneva Motor Show identification parts code prefix: 04E, ID code: CHYA, CHYB, CHZD, CPGA, CSEB, DHSB engine displacement & engine configuration 1.0 L (999 cc) inline three engine (R3/I3); bore x stroke: 74.5 mm × 76.4 mm (2.93 in × 3.01 in), bore spacing: 82 mm (3.2 in), [ 2 ] stroke ratio : 0.99:1 – ' square engine ', 333.1 cc (20.33 cu in) cylinder, compression ratio: 10.5:1 (11.5:1 for CNG version) [ 3 ] cylinder block & crankcase cast aluminium alloy; four main bearings, die-forged steel crankshaft cylinder head & valvetrain cast aluminium alloy; four valves per cylinder, 12 valves total, double overhead camshaft (DOHC) aspiration natural and turbocharged fuel system multi-point electronic indirect fuel injection with three intake manifold-sited fuel injectors DIN-rated motive power & torque outputs 44 kW (60 PS; 59 bhp) at 5,000 rpm; 95 N⋅m (70 lb⋅ft) at 3,000–4,250 rpm (CHYA) [ 3 ] 55 kW (75 PS; 74 bhp) at 6,200 rpm; 95 N⋅m (70 lb⋅ft) at 3,000–4,250 rpm (CHYB) [ 3 ] 50 kW (68 PS; 67 bhp) at 6,200 rpm; 90 N⋅m (66 lb⋅ft) at 3,000–4,250 rpm with CNG (CPGA) [ 3 ] 62 kW (84 PS; 83 bhp) at 6,350 rpm; 102 N⋅m (75 lb⋅ft) at 3,000 rpm with Ethanol (CSEB) 70 kW (95 PS; 94 bhp) at 5,000–5,500 rpm; 160 N⋅m (118 lb⋅ft) at 1500–3,500 rpm (CHZB) 85 kW (116 PS; 114 bhp) at 5,000–5,500 rpm; 200 N⋅m (148 lb⋅ft) at 2000–3,500 rpm (CHZD) 94 kW (128 PS; 126 bhp) at 5,500 rpm; 200 N⋅m (148 lb⋅ft) at 2,000–3,500 rpm with Ethanol (DHSB) application Volkswagen up! , Skoda Citigo , Škoda Fabia III , Seat Mii , Seat Ibiza (5th Gen) , Seat Arona , Volkswagen Golf VII , Volkswagen Polo , Volkswagen T-Roc , Volkswagen T-Cross , Audi A1 (GB) , SEAT León (4th Gen) 1.2 R4 inline-four TSI [ edit ] Main article - Volkswagen_EA211_engine These newly developed generation of modern petrol engines are manufactured at the Škoda Auto plant in Mladá Boleslav . identification EA211 engine family.

camshaft valvetrain that incorporates variable intake and exhaust timing. The only aspect to be carried over from the EA111 engine that
preceded it is the 82 mm cylinder spacing. The cylinder bore was decreased by 2 mm (to 74.5mm) while the stroke was increased to 80mm, a
change which helps compactness, increases torque, and is ideal for adding boost.

For discontinued engines, see List of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines § Four cylinder EA111 petrols , and List of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines § Four cylinder EA827/EA113 petrols . The EA827 family of internal combustion engines was initially developed by Audi under Ludwig Kraus leadership and introduced in 1972 in the Audi 80 , and was eventually superseded by the EA113 evolution introduced in 1993. Both share the same 88 mm (3.46 in) cylinder spacing. The latter EA113 was updated with Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct injection, to be topped by the 200 kW (272 PS; 268 bhp) 2.0 TFSI used in the Audi TTS . Forty million engines have been produced. This range will eventually be superseded by the evolved version with heavy changes EA888 project, introduced with the 1.8 TSI/TFSI below, but the EA113 still remains in production. 1.4 R4 16v TSI/TFSI [ edit ] Based on the EA111, this new engine was announced at the 2005 Frankfurt Motor Show , to be first used in the Mk5 Golf GT , the 125 kW 1.4-litre TSI engine is a " Twincharger ", and uses both a turbocharger and a supercharger . Its displacement downsizing leads to improved fuel economy, with 14% more power than the 2.0 FSI, but consuming 5% less fuel. The mechanical supercharger compressor, driven at 5 times the speed of the crankshaft, mainly operates at low engine speeds from idle up to 2,400 revolutions per minute (rpm) to increase low-end torque. At engine speeds just above idle, the belt-driven supercharger provides a boost pressure of 1.75 bar (25.4 psi). The turbocharger assumes full effectiveness at middle revs, and the engine map disengages the clutch-controlled supercharger at a maximum upper limit of 3,500 rpm; the supercharger will then be bypassed once the turbocharger spools up and reaches sufficient speed to provide adequate boost in the upper rev-ranges. This engine is made at Volkswagen-Motorenfertigung, Chemnitz . In 2007, Volkswagen announced the 90 kW model which will replace the 1.6 FSI 85 kW (116 PS; 114 bhp) engine. This engine differs from the 103 kW and 125 kW models in several ways. It uses only one method of forced induction – a turbocharger (and not a supercharger), and has water-cooled intercooler. The engine has reduced frictional losses, optimised camshafts, new intake ports, and new high-pressure injector valves. It is also 14 kg (31 lb) lighter than the 125 kW model, in order to improve fuel economy and reduce emissions.

Output varies based on internal component selection, turbocharger, and engine control unit (ECU) software. This ubiquitous power plant has been extensively used in all four mainstream Volkswagen Group marques, along with Volkswagen Industrial Motor applications. This engine is also used in a very high state of tune in the one-make Formula Palmer Audi (FPA) open-wheeled auto racing series. It develops 300 bhp (224 kW; 304 PS), with an extra 60 bhp (45 kW; 61 PS) available from a driver operated 'push-to-pass' turbo boost button. Based entirely on road-car production engines and prepared and built by Mountune Racing , it only differs by utilising a Pi Research Pectel electronic fuel injection and a water-cooled Garrett T34 turbocharger with closed-loop boost control. Furthermore, an even higher 'step up' version of this engine was used in the later European -based FIA Formula Two Championship . Developed as a pure race engine and again built by Mountune Racing, this variant includes many all-new lightweight components, and has been converted to a dry sump lubrication system. For its initial 2009 season , it produced a continuous maximum power of 400 bhp (298 kW; 406 PS) at 8,250 revolutions per minute (rpm), and includes a limited duration 'overboost' to 450 bhp (336 kW; 456 PS), aided by an all-new Garrett GT35 turbocharger and a Pi Research Pectel MQ12 ECU. From the 2010 season , base power is increased to 425 bhp (317 kW; 431 PS), and with overboost to 480 bhp (358 kW; 487 PS). identification parts code prefix: 058, 06A, 06B engine displacement & engine configuration 1,781 cc (108.7 cu in) inline-four engine (R4/I4); bore x stroke: 81.0 mm × 86.4 mm (3.19 in × 3.40 in), stroke ratio: 0.94:1 – undersquare/long-stroke, 445.2 cc per cylinder, compression ratio: 9.0–9.5:1 cylinder block & crankcase grey cast iron; five main bearings, die-forged steel crankshaft, fracture-split forged steel connecting rods, Mahle forged aluminium alloy pistons cylinder head & valvetrain cast aluminium alloy; five valves per cylinder, 20 valves total, hydraulic bucket tappets, timing belt-driven double overhead camshaft (DOHC) with variable inlet valve timing aspiration cast aluminium alloy intake manifold, turbocharger, intercooler fuel system, ignition system & engine management multi-point electronic sequential indirect fuel injection with four intake manifold-sited fuel injectors; mapped direct ignition with four individual direct-acting single spark coils ; Bosch Motronic ME 7.5 (MBE 975F on Industrial variants) electronic engine control unit (ECU), red line: 6,500 rpm, rev limit 6,800 rpm Mass 149 kg ('BAM' engine, dry) DIN-rated motive power & torque outputs, ID codes, applications 110 kW (150 PS; 148 bhp) at 5,800 rpm; 210 N⋅m (155 lbf⋅ft) at 1,750–4,600 rpm — AEB, AGU, AJH, ANB, APH, ARX, ARZ, ATW, AUM, AWC, AWD, AWL, AWT, AWV, AWW, BJX, BKF, BKV VW Polo GTI , VW Golf Mk4 GTI , VW Bora , VW New Beetle , VW Passat B5 and VW Sagitar .

For discontinued engines, see List of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines § Four cylinder EA111 petrols , and List of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines § Four cylinder EA827/EA113 petrols . The EA888 engines are a family of three- and four-cylinder engines that are currently [ when? ] in use across the Volkswagen Group. An EA888 family is a corporate VAG designed unit that is an evolution of the earlier EA827/113 units. It features some of the latest engine technology such as direct fuel injection, sintered camshaft lobes, thin-walled engine block, variable valve timing and lift for intake and exhaust valves, downstream oxygen sensors, exhaust manifold integrated into the cylinder head, exhaust gas recirculation and cooling, distributors coil-on-plug ignition, lightweight engine internals, slide valve thermostat (some variants), and the addition of port fuel injection to aid low load fuel consumption and cold start emissions. The port fuel injection also aids in reducing the potential carbon deposits that can occur in direct-injected engines. As of 2024, the 'dual injection' system has not been offered in North American markets. Still, VAG has made numerous enhancements to their engine designs such as the positive crankcase ventilation, repositioning injectors and more to lessen the potential that carbon deposits accumulate on intake valves. Currently, the EA888 engine is available in two sizes: 1.8T and 2.0T. Engine output ranges from 111 kW (151 PS; 149 bhp) to over 231 kW (314 PS; 310 bhp). A concept car based on the Volkswagen Golf R, dubbed R400, produced 395 hp from 2 litres of displacement. Furthermore, the R400 would be able to accelerate from 0–100 km/h in just 3.8 seconds, thanks to a haldex 4-wheel drive system, and a 6 or 7-speed DSG gearbox. The EA888 engine family has also found its way into the Porsche lineup, specifically in the Macan models. The Macan uses a reworked version of the Volkswagen Group’s 2.0-litre inline-four EA888 Gen 3 engine. This engine is a variant of the EA888, producing 261 hp and 295 lb-ft. It’s paired with a Doppelkupplungsgetriebe, which means PDK (Porsche Dual-clutch transmission) and is Porsche's version of the DSG found in VAG vehicles. The PDK transmission is essentially two gearboxes in one and features hydraulically actuated wet-clutch packs. Depending on the gear, it alternates power to the engine via two separate driveshafts. This combination of the EA888 engine and PDK transmission in the Porsche Macan showcases the versatility of these technologies and their ability to enhance performance across different vehicle models within the Volkswagen Group. This latest EA888 family of straight-four 16-valve internal combustion engines with variable valve timing is anticipated to be an eventual complete replacement of the EA113 range. It was wholly designed and developed by VAG AG . The only common feature with its predecessors is the sharing of the same 88 mm (3.46 in) cylinder spacing – which keeps the engine length relatively short, meaning it can be installed either transversely or longitudinally , though engineers have said that it is an evolution of the earlier EA827/113 designs due to cost concerns. Grey cast iron (GJL 250) remains the choice material for the cylinder block and crankcase, due to its inherent good acoustic dampening properties. This all-new EA888 range is notable for utilising simplex roller chains to drive the two overhead camshafts, instead of the former engines' toothed-rubber timing belt . Like the final developments of the former EA113 engine generation, all EA888s only use the VAG AG/Bosch Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) direct injection. Furthermore, EA888 engines are also able to utilise the corporate 'valvelift' technology, which complements the existing variable valve timing . This new family of engines is scheduled to be universally available for all markets on five continents, within all marques of the Volkswagen Group . The closely related EA113 range still remains in production.

Known problems [ edit ] The Generation 1 EA888 suffered from higher than usual / favorable engine oil consumption in both 1.8 and 2.0 litre forms. Mainly affecting the Longitudinal Audi applications between 2008 and 2012 (most commonly the 8K / B8 A4 8T / 8F B8 A5 & 8R Q5). In rare occurrences it affects the Transverse applications in the 8P Audi A3, 8J Audi TT and in even rarer occasions would affect the MK6 Volkswagen Golf GTI and lower powered Sciroccos etc. that were not fitted with the EA113 family of engines. In even more extreme cases it would affect the Generation 3 from 2016 to present day. The rectification for this is performed after a two part oil consumption test is carried out by a main dealer, The vehicle will need to be burning more than approximately a metric litre per 1,000 KM or 600 miles, or if the top up oil warning illuminates on the instrument cluster. Only after this test is carried out and an agreement of payment by the manufacturer & customer contribution is agreed the repair can be carried out only by main dealers and manufacturer approved repairers. The rectification that is carried out is to remove the engine, replace the Piston & Connecting Rod assemblies in all four cylinders with modified units, head gasket and so forth. From late 2012, the modified internal engine components were fitted to new replacement engines and new vehicle units by the Volkswagen group engine plants. Another common issue is camshaft timing chain tensioner failure, again in earlier generation 1 models. This was due to the design of the retaining element that after higher mileages and / or premature wear stopped the tensioner from holding the tension in the timing chain. If in the case of this component 
failing, the chain would jump, allowing the pistons and valves to potentially hit each other, causing expensive and possibly terminal engine damage. Along with the earlier mentioned oil consumption issues, this was eventually addressed by the Volkswagen Group engine plants, Who fitted a modified (internally known as Version 2) tensioner that is retained by a much more reliable spring retainer instead. The final mainstream common issue affects all EA888 generations. The cooling system is mainly a problem free system, with the exception of the plastic thermostat unit, these are very commonly known to be prone to leaks, with no specific part of the housing known to leak. On the EA888, the thermostat unit also includes the coolant pump, on the Generation 2 & 3 the coolant pump is still part of the thermostat, however is available separately. The coolant pump / thermostat unit is located under the intake manifold regardless of generation, model year or application. The thermostat side is joined by a plastic union directly to the engine oil cooler, which in turn is mounted to and is an integral part of the ancillary / alternator bracket (also includes the oil filter housing in all generations and applications). The coolant pump is driven by the intake side balance shaft, on the flywheel side of the engine. The rectification is to renew the thermostat unit with a modified unit, and if needed in later models, the coolant pump if necessary. However these newer units are still known to leak. There have currently been no further modifications to the design of this to combat the issues by Volkswagen Group. Turbo [ edit ] Source: [ 10 ] The MQB platform suffers from early turbocharger failure. This affects models like the Audi S3, Golf 7 R/GTI and the Seat Cupra models. More so: models built prior to 2015 are more prone to failure. This can be caused because there is shaft play due to an imbalanced input shaft which can cause the turbine to collide with the teflon coating of the turbocharger, or because of the manifold sealing surface.

EA390 VR6 [ edit ] The VR6 concept as a whole replaces opposing cylinders in a V-arrangement with staggered ones, creating something between an I6 and a V6. By staggering the cylinders, a much tighter V-angle can be achieved, resulting in a tighter form factor and more efficient packaging. The EA390 was originally a 3.2L cast iron block that was released in 2001 in the European markets, and was used across various Volkswagen, Audi and Porsche vehicles. The engine was derived from earlier smaller 2.8L variants found mainly in various 1990s Volkswagens, such as the Golf and the Corrado. It was later discountined in European markets due to favour of more efficient layouts, despite being one of the more efficient naturally aspirated V-style designs of the time. Currently, a 2.5 VR6 engine is only available for Chinese market on Volkswagen Teramont and Talagon . It is derived from now retired 3.0 VR6 engine, which also was available in China only [ citation needed ] . identification parts code prefix: 03H, ID Code: DDKA, DPKA engine displacement & engine configuration 2,492 cc (152.1 cu in) 10.6° VR6 ; bore x stroke: 81.0 mm × 80.6 mm (3.19 in × 3.17 in), stroke ratio: 1:1 – square-stroke, 415.3 cc per cylinder, compression ratio is not disclosed at the moment. cylinder block & crankcase grey cast iron; die-forged steel crankshaft; cylinder head & valvetrain cast aluminium alloy; four unequal-length valves per cylinder, 24 valves total, low-friction roller finger cam followers with automatic hydraulic valve clearance compensation, simplex roller chain-driven double overhead camshaft (DOHC – one camshaft for all exhaust valves, and one for all intake valves), continuous timing adjustment variable valve timing (52 degrees on the inlet, 22 degrees on the exhaust) aspiration single turbo charger from MHI (Mitsubishi Heavy Industries), hot-film air mass meter , electronic drive by wire throttle valve, two-piece cast aluminium alloy intake manifold, two cast iron exhaust manifolds fuel system Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) high-pressure direct injection with two common rails.

For discontinued engines, see List of discontinued Volkswagen Group petrol engines § Eight cylinder petrols . The twin-turbo EA825 in a Bentley Bentayga EA824 and EA825 are families of twin turbo 90 degrees V8 spark ignition engines. Audi uses the EA824, while Porsche uses EA825 for Panamera Turbo. [ 16 ] Bentley uses this for the Bentayga V8 . EA825 uses two twin-scroll turbochargers, iron coating on the cylinder linings, 250 bar (3,626 psi) fuel injector at centre of combustion chamber, cylinder deactivation at 950–3500rpm with a 250 N⋅m (184 lb⋅ft) torque limit. [ 17 ] Of their eight-cylinder petrol engines, all Volkswagen Group V8 engines are primarily constructed from a lightweight cast aluminium alloy cylinder block (crankcase) and cylinder heads. They all use multi-valve technology, with the valves being operated by two overhead camshafts per cylinder bank (sometimes referred to as 'quad cam'). All functions of engine control are carried out by varying types of Robert Bosch GmbH Motronic electronic engine control units . These V8 petrol engines initially were only used in cars bearing the Audi marque , but are now also installed in Volkswagen Passenger Cars 'premium models'. They are all longitudinally orientated , and with the exception of the Audi R8 , are front-mounted . This engine is part of Audi's modular 90° V6/V8 engine family. It shares its bore and stroke, 90° V-angle, and 90mm cylinder spacing with the Audi V6. The earlier V6 engines (EA837) used an Eaton TVS Supercharger instead of turbocharger(s). In 2016, Audi and Porsche released a new turbocharged V6 engine they dubbed EA839. These 2.9L (biturbo) & 3.0L (single turbo) V6 engines share the 4.0T TFSI V8's "hot vee" design, meaning the turbo(s) are placed in the Vee of the engine (between each bank of cylinders) instead of on the outside of each cylinder bank. This allows the turbocharger(s) to produce boost pressure more quickly as the path the exhaust gases travel is much reduced. It also aids in getting the engine's emissions hardware up to temperature more quickly. As with the V6, the V8 is used in various Audi and Porsche models, but the V8 also finds use in Bentley and Lamborghini vehicles. engine displacement & engine configuration 3,993 cc (243.7 cu in) 90° V8 engine ; 90 mm (3.54 in) cylinder spacing; bore x stroke: 84.5 mm × 89.0 mm (3.33 in × 3.50 in), stroke ratio: 0.95:1 – undersquare/long-stroke, 499.1 cc per cylinder, compression ratio: 10.5:1 fuel system; Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) Central-Overhead Injectors exhaust system two twin-scroll turbo chargers and twin air- and water-cooled intercoolers DIN-rated motive power & torque outputs, ID codes, applications 309 kW (420 PS; 414 bhp) at 5,500 rpm; 550 N⋅m (406 lbf⋅ft) from 1,400 rpm to 5,400 rpm — CEUC: Audi S6 C7 , S7 , CEUA: A8 D4 320 kW (435 PS; 429 bhp) at 5,800 rpm; 600 N⋅m (443 lbf⋅ft) from 1,400 rpm to 5,300 rpm — CTGA: A8 D4 , A8 D5 445 kW (605 PS; 597 bhp) at 6,200 rpm; 700 N⋅m (516 lbf⋅ft) from 1,700 rpm to 5,500 rpm — DDTA: Audi S8 D4 (overboost to 750 Nm), CWUC: Audi RS7 performance(C7) , Audi RS6 performance (C7) 412 kW (560 PS; 553 bhp) at 5,700 rpm; 700 N⋅m (516 lbf⋅ft) from 1,750 rpm to 5,500 rpm — CRDB, CWUB: Audi RS6 C7 and RS7 C7 338 kW (460 PS; 453 bhp) at 5,500 rpm; 620 N⋅m (457 lbf⋅ft) from 1,800 rpm to 4,500 rpm — CXYA: A8 D5 , CVDD: Porsche Panamera GTS 353 kW (480 PS; 473 bhp) at 5,500 rpm; 620 N⋅m (457 lbf⋅ft) from 1,800 rpm to 4,500 rpm — CVDE: Porsche Panamera GTS (Facelifted) 373 kW (507 PS; 500 bhp) at 6,000 rpm; 660 N⋅m (487 lbf⋅ft) from 1,700 rpm to 5,400 rpm — CMMC, CYCB: Bentley Continental GT V8 and Flying Spur V8 388 kW (528 PS; 520 bhp) at 6,000 rpm; 680 N⋅m (502 lbf⋅ft) at 1,750 rpm to 5,500 rpm — CMMD, CYCA: Bentley Continental GT V8 S 373 kW (507 PS; 500 bhp) at 5,500 rpm; 770 N⋅m (568 lbf⋅ft) from 2,000 rpm to 4,000 rpm — DCUE, DWRB: Audi SQ7 , SQ8 405 kW (551 PS; 543 bhp) from 5,750 rpm to 6,000 rpm; 770 N⋅m (568 lbf⋅ft) from 1,960 rpm to 4,500 rpm — MCV.DA: Porsche Panamera Turbo, Turbo S E-Hybrid , CVDA: Bentley Continental GT V8 (2019–) , Flying Spur (2019-) 420 kW (571 PS; 563 bhp) at 6,000 rpm; 800 N⋅m (590 lbf⋅ft) from 2,050 rpm to 4,500 rpm — CWWD, DWKA: Audi S8 D5 420 kW (571 PS; 563 bhp) from 5,750 rpm to 6,000 rpm; 770 N⋅m (568 lbf⋅ft) from 1,960 rpm to 4,500 rpm — CVDA: Porsche Panamera Turbo S E-Hybrid (Facelifted) 441 kW (600 PS; 591 bhp) from 6,000 rpm to 6,250 rpm; 800 N⋅m (590 lbf⋅ft) from 2,050 rpm to 4,500 rpm in Audi RS6 C8 and RS7 C8 441 kW (600 PS; 591 bhp) at 6,000 rpm; 800 N⋅m (590 lbf⋅ft) from 2,200 rpm to 4,500 rpm — DHUB: Audi RS Q8 463 kW (630 PS; 621 bhp) at 6,000 rpm; 850 N⋅m (627 lbf⋅ft) from 2,300 rpm to 4,500 rpm — DYGA: Audi RS6 Avant performance (C8) and RS7 performance (C8) 463 kW (630 PS; 621 bhp) from 5,750 rpm to 6,000 rpm; 820 N⋅m (605 lbf⋅ft) from 1,960 rpm to 4,500 rpm — DTCA: Porsche Panamera Turbo S 478 kW (650 PS; 641 bhp) at 6,000 rpm; 850 N⋅m (627 lbf⋅ft) in Lamborghini Urus 471 kW (640 PS; 632 bhp) at 6,000 rpm; 850 N⋅m (627 lbf⋅ft) — DWNA: Porsche Cayenne Coupé Turbo GT , Audi RSQ8 performance 485 kW (659 PS; 650 bhp) at 6,000 rpm; 850 N⋅m (627 lbf⋅ft) in 2023 facelift version of Porsche Cayenne Coupé Turbo GT Audi version of the engine includes electronic monitoring of the oil level, while Bentley engine includes a dipstick for oil check.
