It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages , or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories (except for eponymous maintenance categories). This is a tracking category . It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme . This category is hidden on its member pages —unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. These categories can be used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse " (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list ( discriminated by classifications ). This category combines all articles containing potentially dated statements from May 2024 (2024-05) to enable us to work through the backlog more systematically. It is a member of Category:Articles containing potentially dated statements . Articles in this category contain statements that may become dated originating from May 2024. The statements may need to be updated, removed or edited for perspective. Articles containing older statements are more likely to be dated. This is not a backlog; not all articles in this category will need updating at this point in time. Use {{ As of }} to mark all individual statements that may become dated, this will automatically add them to the appropriate categories. Wherever possible, use {{ Update after }} to mark exactly when statements will need updating in addition to using {{ As of }} . See also [ edit ] Special:Search/ "as of May 2024" for a more complete list. Wikipedia:As of for details of dealing with statements that date quickly. Wikipedia:Avoid statements that will date quickly for guidelines on using precise language when dealing with information that may date quickly. Category:Wikipedia articles in need of updating and the accompanying {{ Update after }} template.
