The cabrios are being evaluated for rigidity, roof operation, and overall durability, says Mercedes. The automaker wants to ensure the open-air version maintains the trademark solidity of the standard model, as well as its signature off-road capability. Later this winter, the prototypes will head to Sweden for cold-weather testing, the goal of which will be to stress every mechanical and structural component in the subzero clime. Mercedes wants to prove that deleting the fixed roof has not compromised the vehicle’s robustness, whether crawling over rocks or slogging through blizzards. Mercedes-Benz Mercedes has been leaning into the G-Class’s cult status of late, acknowledging the model’s desirability despite—or perhaps because of—its impracticality. The automaker says as enthusiastic reaction to early teasers suggests there’s an eager audience for the cab. Mercedes-Benz will reveal full details later, but for now emphasized the Cabriolet will be a “special edition” rather than a full-production variant.
