Transurban, either independently or through financial consortiums, manages and develops urban toll road networks across Australia , Canada and the United States . It is listed on the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Transurban is the full owner of CityLink in Melbourne , which connects three of the city's major freeways. When Transurban was founded in March 1996, it was only limited to the operation of CityLink, under a 'single purpose' restriction. However, in September 2001, an agreement was reached with the Victoria State Government on a corporate restructure to allow Transurban to undertake other activities outside of CityLink and pursue new business. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Since then, Transurban has grown and currently has stakes in six tolled motorways in Sydney and six tolled motorways in Brisbane . Linkt is Transurban's e-TAG toll brand and can be used in all toll roads in Australia. In the United States, Transurban has ownership interests in the 495 Express Lanes on a section of the Capital Beltway around Washington, DC . It also has an interest in the connecting 95 Express Lanes project on Interstate 95 . In Canada, Transurban holds an interest in the A25 Motorway .

Roads and projects [ edit ] Transurban has an interest in 16 urban motorways in Australia, Canada and the United States.

[ 20 ] The other 37.5% stake in the Transurban Queensland consortium is divided between AustralianSuper (25.0%) and Tawreed Investments (12.5%). [ 21 ] The consortium was set up in 2014 to acquire Queensland Motorways , which operated the Gateway Motorway , Logan Motorway , Go Between Bridge , Clem Jones Tunnel (CLEM7) and the then under-construction Legacy Way . [ 22 ] It also inherited the go via tolling system used by Queensland Motorways, which has since been rebranded to Linkt in May 2018.
