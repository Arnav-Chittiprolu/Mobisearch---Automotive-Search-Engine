[ 28 ] [ 29 ] Vehicles sold in the North America and several other regions continued to be called Tucson. [ 30 ] The ix35 was unveiled at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show . [ 31 ] The power output, fuel-efficiency, comfort and safety features were claimed to have been all upgraded. Known by the project name LM , it took 36 months and 280 billion won (approx. US$225 million) to develop. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] The ix35's styling was reported to be based on Hyundai ix-onic concept. [ 34 ] The ix35 was penned by Hyundai designer Cha Il-Hoei in 2007, under the guidance of former BMW designer Thomas Bürkle at Hyundai's Rüsselsheim design studio in Germany and continues the company's styling language, marketed as "fluidic sculpture". [ 35 ] [ 36 ] The compact crossover vehicle has sweeping coupe-like lines, a premium vehicle feel and comes with features unavailable on its predecessor. Facelift [ edit ] The facelifted Tucson was released in South Korea on 2 May 2013, based on the European market ix35 styling with new grille, projector headlights, tail lights, rounded fog lights and front bumper. [ 37 ] This facelift was also released in China in August 2013 under the ix35 nameplate, and was not applied in most markets outside South Korea and China, especially in Europe, where only headlights and tail lights were changed, [ 38 ] and in North America and Australia, where it retained the pre-facelift styling with only headlights were changed. [ 39 ] While in Indonesia, the Tucson received its own facelift in April 2014 based on the global model styling with new grille (similar to the South Korean and Chinese markets), projector headlights, tail lights and fog lights.

The ix35 NU was revealed on the 2017 Shanghai Auto Show in China and was available to the Chinese car market in the third quarter of 2017. [ 41 ] Hyundai ix35 (China, facelift) Second-generation Hyundai ix35 (China) Europe [ edit ] The European market ix35 has a restyled grille, front bumper, rounded fog lights and projector headlights, to differentiate it with global models.

The GL comes with a standard manual transmission, but a 6-speed automatic transmission is available and is standard on GLS and Limited. The North American version uses a different gauge cluster design than the Korean version. The 2011 Tucson offered in the U.S. a new GL trim which replaces the 2010 GLS model as Tucson's base trim. The GL is powered by a new 2.0-litre 4-cylinder engine mated to either a five-speed manual or an available six-speed automatic transmission in order to obtain better fuel economy than the 2.4-litre engine. 2014 model year Tucson for North America have been upgraded with GDI direct injected Theta II engines that obtain more power and better emissions, LED tail/head lights, more stylish alloy rim designs, and a few minor improvements to the interior/audio system. Powertrain [ edit ] Hyundai ix35 FCEV The Tucson/ix35 is available with several engines: an all-new 2.0-litre diesel R engine, one of two Theta-II petrol engine variants (2.0-litre or 2.4-litre), 1.7-litre UII diesel and 1.6-litre Gamma GDI petrol.

The manual transmissions available in Europe is a 6-speed for 1.7-litre and 2.0-litre diesels and 1.6 Gamma and a 5-speed for 2.0 Theta. The 2.0-litre diesel engine, available outside of North America, meets the Euro-5 emissions standards and achieves 6.5 l/100 km (15.4 km/L; 36.2 mpg ‑US ) fuel economy with maximum power output of 184 hp (187 PS; 137 kW). The 2.0-litre petrol engine has a fuel economy of 8.5 l/100 km (11.8 km/L; 27.7 mpg ‑US ) with 166 hp (168 PS; 124 kW). In South Korea, the diesel engine is offered in both front-wheel drive and all-wheel drive configurations, while the 2.0-litre petrol engine is available only in front-wheel drive. The North American versions are powered by either the 2.0-litre producing 165 hp (167 PS; 123 kW) or a 2.4-litre four-cylinder petrol engine producing 176 hp (178 PS; 131 kW) mated to the six-speed automatic transmission. The 2.4-litre engine makes almost the same power as the previous generation V6 engine while managing 20% better fuel economy than the previous generation four-cylinder.

The manual and dual clutch transmission options were dropped in favor of the 6-speed Shiftronic automatic used in the previous model. The 2.0-litre Nu GDi engine continues in the SE and Value trim levels but for other trims the 1.6-litre I4 turbocharged engine was dropped and replaced by a 2.4-litre I4 GDi naturally aspirated engine which produces 181 hp (184 PS; 135 kW) at 6,000 rpm and 175 lb⋅ft (237 N⋅m; 24.2 kg⋅m) with a slight loss in fuel economy.

[ 66 ] First facelift (Chinese market) Second facelift (Chinese market) Second facelift (Chinese market) Powertrain [ edit ] During the Geneva Motor Show, Hyundai also unveiled two concept variants, a Tucson hybrid electric and a diesel-powered plug-in hybrid . The 48V Hybrid combines a 2.0-litre diesel model with 134 hp (100 kW) and a six-speed manual transmission along with a 14 hp (10 kW) electric motor; combined system performance is 148 hp (110 kW) and 413 N·m (305 lb-ft) of torque. This increases system power by 10% while emitting only 109 g/km CO 2 . The concept plug-in-hybrid is also based on the all-new Tucson platform and is equipped with a 1.7-litre diesel engine and a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission. The engine generates 113 hp (85 kW) and is accompanied by a 67 hp (50 kW) electric motor and a 10.7 kWh lithium-ion polymer battery , which delivers an all-electric range of more than 50 km (31 mi). Combined system output is a maximum of 180 hp (135 kW) with 474 N·m (350 lb-ft) of torque, with estimated CO 2 emissions of less than 48 g/km.
