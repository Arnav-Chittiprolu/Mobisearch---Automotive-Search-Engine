ESC is built on top of an anti-lock brake system, and all ESC-equipped vehicles are fitted with traction control. ESC components include a yaw rate sensor, a lateral acceleration sensor, a steering wheel sensor, and an upgraded integrated control unit. In the US, federal regulations have required that ESC be installed as a standard feature on all passenger cars and light trucks as of the 2012 model year.<ref name="Sullivan">{{cite web|last=Sullivan |first=Bob |url=http://redtape.msnbc.com/2010/03/toyota-woes-raise-ghost-in-the-machine-fears.html |title=Red Tape – Who's driving?

Instead, it was frequently bundled with other features or more expensive trims, so the cost of a package that included ESC was several thousand dollars.

===Availability===
Availability of ESC in passenger vehicles has varied between manufacturers and countries. In 2007, ESC was available in roughly 50% of new North American models compared to about 75% in Sweden. However, consumer awareness affects buying patterns, so that roughly 45% of vehicles sold in North America and the UK were purchased with ESC,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thatcham.org/esc/ |title=Electronic Stability Control |publisher=Thatcham.org |access-date=2011-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111126185724/http://thatcham.org/esc/ |archive-date=2011-11-26 }}</ref> contrasting with 78–96% in other European countries such as Germany, Denmark, and Sweden. While few vehicles had ESC prior to 2004, increased awareness has increased the number of vehicles with ESC on the used car market.

ESC is available on cars, SUVs and pickup trucks from all major automakers. Luxury cars, sports cars, SUVs, and crossovers are usually equipped with ESC. Midsize cars have also been gradually catching on, though the 2008 model years of the [[Nissan Altima]] and [[Ford Fusion (Americas)|Ford Fusion]] only offered ESC on their V6 engine-equipped cars; however, some midsize cars, such as the [[Honda Accord (North America eighth generation)|Honda Accord]], had it as standard by then. While traction control is usually included with ESC, there were vehicles such as the 2008 [[Chevrolet Malibu]] LS, 2008 [[Mazda6]], and 2007 [[Lincoln MKZ]] that had traction control but not ESC. ESC was rare among subcompact cars in 2008.{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}} The 2009 [[Toyota Corolla]] in the United States (but not Canada) had stability control as a $250 option on all trims below that of the XRS, which had it as standard.<ref name="usatoday.com"/> In Canada, for the 2010 Mazda3, ESC was an option on the midrange GS trim as part of its [[sunroof]] package, and is standard on the top-of-the-line GT version.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mazda.ca/Configurator/pdfs/eng/2010_Mazda3Sport_EN_EquipmentWalk.pdf |title=2010 Mazda 3 Equipment |access-date=2011-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006151947/http://www.mazda.ca/Configurator/pdfs/eng/2010_Mazda3Sport_EN_EquipmentWalk.pdf |archive-date=2011-10-06 }}</ref> The 2009 Ford Focus had ESC as an option for the S and SE models, and it was standard on the SEL and SES models<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wheels.ca/article/545308 |title=2009 Ford Focus: zeroing in on comfort rather than sportiness |publisher=Wheels.ca |date=2009-05-09 |access-date=2011-11-13}}</ref>

In the UK, even mass-market [[supermini]]s such as the [[Ford Fiesta|Ford Fiesta Mk.6]] and [[Volkswagen Polo Mk5|VW Polo Mk.5]] came with ESC as standard.

ESC is also available on some motor homes.

The ''ChooseESC!'' campaign,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chooseesc.eu|title=Home|last=Larsen|first=Pernille|website=www.chooseesc.eu|access-date=2017-04-29}}</ref> run by the EU's ''eSafetyAware!'' project,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esafetyaware.eu|title=eSafetyAware! eSafetyAware!
