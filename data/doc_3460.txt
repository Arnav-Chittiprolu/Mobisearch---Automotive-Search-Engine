See Template:Navbox visibility for a brief explanation. This is a navigational template created using {{ navbox }} . It can be transcluded on pages by placing {{Masonry tools}} below the standard article appendices . Initial visibility This template's initial visibility currently defaults to autocollapse , meaning that if there is another collapsible item on the page (a navbox, sidebar , or table with the collapsible attribute ), it is hidden apart from its title bar; if not, it is fully visible. To change this template's initial visibility, the |state= parameter may be used: {{ Masonry tools | state = collapsed }} will show the template collapsed, i.e. hidden apart from its title bar. {{ Masonry tools | state = expanded }} will show the template expanded, i.e. fully visible. Templates using the classes class=navbox ( {{ navbox }} ) or class=nomobile ( {{ sidebar }} ) are not displayed in article space on the mobile web site of English Wikipedia. Mobile page views accounted for 60% to 70% of all page views from 2020 through 2025. Briefly, these templates are not included in articles because 1) they are not well designed for mobile, and 2) they significantly increase page sizes—bad for mobile downloads—in a way that is not useful for the mobile use case. You can review/watch phab:T124168 for further discussion.
