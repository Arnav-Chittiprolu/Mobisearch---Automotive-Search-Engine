The Ayla has also been sold by Toyota (Daihatsu's parent company since 2016) as the Toyota Agya in Indonesia, South Africa, [ 1 ] Tunisia [ 2 ] and Americas (except North America), and the Toyota Wigo in the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Brunei and Vietnam through an OEM agreement. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The car is also slightly reengineered and manufactured in Malaysia by Perodua as the Perodua Axia . [ 6 ] The first-generation Ayla and Agya were first unveiled at the 20th Indonesia International Motor Show in September 2012 and went on sale a year later, in September 2013. The second-generation models were unveiled in February 2023 and went on sale a month afterwards. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The name Ayla was taken from the Sanskrit word meaning 'light', while Agya means 'fast'. [ 9 ] The name was chosen to comply with the Indonesian government-endorsed Low Cost Green Car (LCGC) tax exemption program which requires an Indonesian-inspired name. [ 10 ] The program also requires for an Indonesian-inspired badge to be used, with the Ayla using an A-shaped front logo while the Agya for the Indonesian market opting for a Garuda -inspired front badge (except for the second-generation Agya GR Sport which is not eligible for the LCGC program).

Concept models [ edit ] Ayla Turbo Concept [ edit ] The Ayla Turbo is a one-off concept car that was shown at the 26th Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show in August 2018, based on the 1.2-litre model. The two-tone red and black exterior colour is partially inspired from the 1984 Charade De Tomaso Turbo . The front and rear bumper design has also been redesigned. The 3NR-VE engine has been extensively modified by fitting a turbocharger that is equipped with intercooler , wastegate and blow-off valve with 0.5 bar (7.3 psi) of boost that uprates the power output to 147 kW (197 hp; 200 PS) and torque to 242 N⋅m (178 lbf⋅ft). Further engine changes include the use of low-compression piston, dual fuel injector, open air filter and stronger connecting rod. The 3-module piggyback has been used to manipulate the engine data for performance orientation, while the exhaust system uses a stainless steel free-flow type with a diameter of 63.5 mm (2.5 in). The interior has been stripped down in order to gain lower weight and the roll cage has been added, along with FIA -certified Sparco racing bucket seats. The AC and other non-essential features have also been removed. The car made a claimed 0-100 km/h (62 mph) acceleration in 10.3 seconds, 2.3 seconds faster than the standard car. The car was still in developmental phase at the time and costs around Rp 500,000,000 ( US$ 35,100 as of March 2019) to build. [ 48 ] [ 49 ] [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] Ayla Turbo front quarter view Ayla Turbo rear quarter view Ayla BEV Concept [ edit ] Ayla BEV The Ayla BEV is an EV conversion prototype that was first presented at the 29th Gaikindo Indonesia International Auto Show on 11 August 2022. The storage battery uses a 32 kWh unit, while the electric motor is rated at 60 kW (80 hp; 82 PS). The suspension was made stronger due to the car being heavier than the regular ICE -powered model.

[ 61 ] [ 62 ] Sales were commenced at the 2nd Gaikindo Jakarta Auto Week on 10 March 2023. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] The cars shared the same DNGA-A platform with the A200 series Rocky crossover SUV, resulting in a longer body and wheelbase. [ 65 ] The development of the second-generation Ayla and Agya was paralleled with the second-generation Perodua Axia , and was led by chief engineer Toshihiro Nakaho from Daihatsu. [ 66 ] Powertrain updates include the 68ps 1.0-litre 1KR-VE and the 88ps 1.2-litre WA-VE three-cylinder engines.

As a result, the trim is not eligible for LCGC regulations, resulting in an upmarket positioning. Aside from aero kits, the GR Sport trim also received specially tuned power steering programming, steering gear, shock absorbers and coil springs . [ 76 ] [ 77 ] The Stylix based on G CVT trim with GR Parts package was introduced at the 32nd Indonesia International Motor Show on 13 February 2025.

The former trim  is equipped with a 1.0-litre petrol and the latter trim  equipped with a 1.2-litre petrol paired only to a CVT.

According to Daihatsu, the inside lining of the front seat door was improperly modified with a "notch"  to prevent the part from breaking into pieces with sharp edges that could injure occupants during a side airbag deployment. These modifications are not present in production vehicles. In response, Toyota chairman Akio Toyoda and Toyota president Koji Sato publicly apologized. [ 94 ] For the Agya, only vehicles bound to be sold in Ecuador would be affected. Toyota had re-tested the model before delivering it to markets with UN-R95 side crash test regulations.
