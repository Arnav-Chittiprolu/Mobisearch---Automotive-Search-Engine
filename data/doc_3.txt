Just like standard sport-utility vehicles, hybrid SUVs are spacious, high-riding vehicles that typically provide seating for five or more passengers. Unlike regular SUVs which use a gas-burning engine as their sole power source, hybrid SUVs are also aided by a battery pack and one or more electric motors. As a result, hybrid SUVs tend to be more fuel-efficient and, in some cases, more powerful than their gas-only counterparts. There are several different types of hybrid SUVs, with traditional hybrid and plug-in hybrid SUVs being the two main categories. What are the benefits of a hybrid SUV? Fuel efficiency is the main benefit of choosing a hybrid SUV over a standard one, as most hybrid SUVs have higher miles per gallon (mpg) ratings than their nonhybrid counterparts. That’s because they use their gasoline engines less often, therefore using less fuel. Also, after harnessing energy that would typically be wasted during braking, hybrid SUVs send that stored energy back to the battery pack that supplies power to the electric motor. Most plug-in hybrid SUVs can also travel short distances on electricity alone, acting like battery-electric vehicles during short commutes. What are the downsides of a hybrid SUV? Hybrid SUVs, especially plug-in-hybrid models, are usually more expensive than standard SUVs. While that additional initial cost is typically offset by the money saved in fuel over the span of a few years, it can sometimes take much longer depending on the initial upcharge amount and the vehicle’s fuel economy. Hybrid SUVs sometimes sacrifice interior space for the battery and other hybrid components, meaning that some hybrid SUVs have less cargo capacity or passenger room than their nonhybrid counterparts.
