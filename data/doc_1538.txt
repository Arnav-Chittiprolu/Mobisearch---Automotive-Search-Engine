It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages , or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories (except for eponymous maintenance categories). This is a hidden category .

Use {{ As of }} to mark all individual statements that may become dated, this will automatically add them to the appropriate categories. Wherever possible, use {{ Update after }} to mark exactly when statements will need updating in addition to using {{ As of }} .
