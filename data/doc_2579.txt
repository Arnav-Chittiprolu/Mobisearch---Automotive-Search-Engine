The first-generation car was based on the Saab 99 chassis, though with a longer front end to meet U.S. frontal crash regulations [ 1 ] and to make room for the turbo-charged engines, air conditioning and other equipment that was not available in the early days of the 99 model. The 900 was produced in 2- and 4-door sedan , and 3- and 5-door hatchback configurations and, from 1986, as a cabriolet ( convertible ) model. There were single- and twin- Zenith carburettor ; fuel injected , and turbocharged engines, including Full Pressure Turbo (FPT) and, in European models during the early 1990s, Low Pressure Turbos (LPT).

[ 2 ] Sales commenced in the fall of 1978. [ 3 ] It has a longitudinally mounted, 45-degree canted, inline four-cylinder engine, double wishbone front suspension and beam-axle rear suspension. Like its predecessor, the 900 contained a number of unusual design features that distinguish it from most other cars. First, the B-engine , that was installed "backwards", with power delivered from the crank at the front of the car. Second, the transmission, technically a transaxle , bolted directly to the bottom of the engine to form the oil pan (albeit with separate oil lubrication). Thus, power from the crank would be delivered out of the engine at the front, then transferred down and back to the transmission below, via a set of chain-driven primary gears. The body was developed from the older 99 model, keeping the basic layout but with a new longer front-end. This allowed for more space in the engine bay and better crash protection for passengers. The middle and rear parts of the body were identical to those of the 99 Combi Coupé (which was withdrawn from the lineup at the same time). Later a new rear end was designed for the 2-door and 4-door sedans. In the early 1980s, most 900s were produced in Trollhättan. However, coinciding with the introduction of the 9000, most of the 900's production took place elsewhere. The Valmet plant in Finland also produced the base models of the 900, a total of 238,898 examples. The plant in Arlöv (now closed), near Malmö, also produced the car. Refined over several decades of two-digit Saab models, the 900's double wishbone suspension design provided excellent handling and road feel. [ citation needed ] The rear suspension comprised a typical beam axle design, stabilized with a Panhard rod . However, the attachment points between the axle and chassis made up an unusual configuration that, in essence, consists of two Watt's linkages at either end of the axle: A lower control arm attaches the axle to the bottom of the vehicle, while an upper link attaches at the top but faces towards the rear, unlike a typical four-link design with both lower and upper links facing forward.
The design-principle being similar with the rear suspension presented in Alfa Romeo Alfasud already in 1971, except in the Alfasud, the beam axle itself functioned as a sway-bar, hence separate sway-bars in the rear suspension were not needed. 1979 5-door hatchback (US market Turbo, pre-facelift) 1984 Turbo 16 Sedan (pre-facelift) 1986 3-door hatchback (pre-facelift) 1984 2-door sedan (pre-facelift) Early models did not have sway bars ; they began appearing on certain models in 1985, and, in U.S. and possibly other markets, became standard on all trim levels by the late 1980s [ vague ] . The sway bars decreased body roll, but at the expense of some ride comfort and when driven aggressively, increased inside wheel spin. The front and rear bars' diameters were unchanged throughout the production run. [ citation needed ] The 900 has a deeply curved windshield , improving driver visibility . The dashboard is also curved to enable easy reach of all controls, and featured gauges lit up from the front. Saab engineers placed all controls and gauges in the dashboard according to their frequency of use and/or importance so that the driver need only divert their gaze from the road for the shortest possible time and by the smallest angle. This is why, for example, the oft-used radio is placed so high in the dashboard. In keeping with the paradigm of its predecessor, the 99 model, the 900 employed a door design unique in automotive manufacturing, with an undercutting sweep to meet the undercarriage, forming a tight, solid unit when the door was closed. This feature also eliminated the stoop in the cabin at the footing of the door, as seen in automobiles of other manufacturers, thereby preventing water and debris from collecting and possibly entering the cabin or initiating corrosion, as well as enabling passengers to enter and exit the cabin without need to step over several inches of ledge. [ citation needed ] The 900 underwent minor cosmetic design changes for 1987, including a restyled front end and bumpers that went from a vertical to a more sloped design. To save money, Saab kept the basic undercarriage more or less unchanged throughout the 900's production run. The Saab 900 could be ordered with different options, including a high performance option called the Aero or, as it was known in the U.S. "Special Performance Group" (SPG). The Aero/SPG incorporated (depending on the market and model year) a body skirt; a sport-suspension (1987 onwards) that included shorter, stiffer springs, stiffer shocks, and sway bars; leather seats; premium stereo; and air conditioning. Each of these features could also be ordered independently from Saab's Accessories Catalog for fitment to standard models. Another UK option at this time was the fitment of Minilite alloy wheels. Initially these had the words 'Minilite' and 'Saab' cast in raised lettering; later cars had similar wheel made by Ronal . [ 4 ] Power output varied by model year and market, but 900S and 900 Turbo models produced from 1985 and onward were fitted with a 16-valve engine, while the base 900 models kept the earlier 8-valve engine. A 1989 Saab 900 SPG, owned by Peter Gilbert of Wisconsin, was driven over a million miles before being donated to The Wisconsin Automotive Museum. Peter Gilbert claimed a million miles out of the turbocharging unit in addition to the engine itself. Saab gave Mr Gilbert a Saab 9-5 Aero. [ 5 ] History [ edit ] The typical Saab windshield shape is visible. The 900 in 1979 was available in three versions of the B-engine : The GL had the single-carb 100 PS (73.5 kW) engine, the GLs had twin carburettors rated at 108 PS (79 kW), the EMS and GLE had Bosch jetronic fuel injection rated 118 PS (87 kW), and the 900 Turbo was rated at 145 PS (107 kW). The Turbo had a different grille from the naturally aspirated models, which received a design with a hexagonal central element. The only bodywork originally available was the three or five-door hatchback, which was seen as more modern at the time. The EMS was only available with three doors while the automatic-equipped GLE was only offered with five. [ 3 ] Saab's model years were generally introduced in August/September of the preceding year. In the most important foreign market, the USA, the model range was different, mainly due to the omission of carburettor engines due to the stricter emissions regulations in force. The Saab 900 was introduced only with two engines: the fuel injected version of 115 hp (86 kW), producing 110 hp (82 kW) in Western and Rocky Mountain states, and the Turbo with 135 hp (101 kW). Engine performance was lower than in other markets due to emissions regulations. The body shapes included three-door GLi, EMS and 900 Turbo variants, along with the 900 GLE and Turbo 5-doors. An optional automatic transmission was available on all models except the Turbos. For the 1980 model year, all versions in all markets received the sleeker turbo-style grille. The 900 also received larger taillights rather than the earlier units shared with the 99, as well as lower, adjustable head restraints. [ citation needed ] 1980 was also the first year for a five-speed gearbox, originally only available in the EMS and the Turbo. [ 6 ] By 1980 in the US, all naturally-aspirated models were now powered by the 110 hp (82 kW), "Lambda" emission control engine which required unleaded fuel only. 1980 was also the last model year for the Saab 99 in the US market. First shown during the 1980 Geneva Motor Show, Saab introduced for the MY 1981 a new body style: a 4-door sedan. With the introduction of the new 4-door sedan, the country importers finally decided which models and in which forms they wanted to offer the 900 in their respective markets. So not all engine and body variants were offered in every country. A policy that Saab maintained in the following years and makes generalization impossible. The information here on individual models and engines depending on the model year is therefore only indicative. While the new body shape complemented the model range in all markets, it replaced the 5-door variant in the U.S. The introduction went along with a considerable boost in equipment (except the base model "GL") as well as broader side trims, larger luggage compartments and fuel tanks on all models. Another big change: the spare tyre was moved to underneath the floor, rather than standing upright in the luggage compartment (this was the case again with the later introduced convertible). [ 3 ] With the introduction of the new 4-door body type for MY 1981, Saab simplified the model designation on the international markets (with the exception of the US): GL for the model with the single carburettor (with 3, 4, or 5 doors), GLs for the models with the twin carburettor engine (also with 3, 4, or 5 doors), GLi as designation for the models with fuel injection (with 3 or 4 doors), and the GLE was now offered as a better equipped GLi only as four-door Sedan. Top of the range was the "Turbo" with the corresponding engine (with 3, 4, or 5 doors). The EMS designation was dropped. In the USA the simplification went even further: "900" for the base model with the 110 hp (81 kW) 8V mechanical Bosch injection engine, "900 S" with the same engine, but better equipment, and "900 TURBO" with the 8V Turbo 135 PS (100 kW) engine. Since 1980 engines in the US were always equipped with catalytic converters. All models were available only as 3- or 4-door type. Also a big change underneath the bonnet for MY 1981 was the evolution of the old "B engine" to the new "H engine" (which was retained until the end of the 900 series in 1994). The H engine was simplified compared to the old engine design, making it more robust and lighter and, according to Saab, should also reduce fuel consumption. The power output remained the same in all variants as the B engine. Characteristics of the new engine type: no countershaft, ignition distributor driven directly by the camshaft. It is assumed that Saab used up old B engine blocks in the Saab 99, so the new engine layout was not officially introduced in the 99 until the MY 82. A big change for 1982 was the introduction of Saab's Automatic Performance Control (APC), a.k.a. boost controller for the turbo models. The APC employed a knock sensor, allowing the engine to use different grades of gasoline without engine damage. Another new feature that year was the introduction of central locking doors (on the GLE and Turbo). The long-wheelbase 900 CD was also introduced. Asbestos -free brakes were introduced in 1983, an industry first. [ 7 ] The front pads were semi-metallic while the rears were made from silica. The GLE model gained a new central console, while the decor strips on the bumpers of all models were made wider (necessitating wider trim pieces on the flanks as well). [ 7 ] A new luxury package was made available on Turbo models. 1985 Saab 900 CD, a limited production version with a longer wheelbase and stretched front and rear doors. Model year 1984 in Europe saw the introduction of the 16-valve DOHC B202 engine (introduced in the US in 1985). With a turbocharger and intercooler, it was rated at 175 PS (129 kW) in the Turbo 16 model (less for catalyst-equipped engines) without catalytic converter (160 PS (118 kW) with cat). The Turbo 16 Aero (designated SPG, Special Performance Group in North American Markets) had a body kit allowing the car to attain speeds up-to 210 km/h (130 mph). A different grille and a three-spoke steering wheel appeared across all models. The connection between the side strips and the bumpers was changed, Turbo hatchbacks received a black trim piece between the taillights, and the GLi began replacing the twin-carburetted GLs. At the 1983 Frankfurt Motor Show a two-door sedan was shown; it went on sale in January 1984, initially only as a GLi. The 2-door was only ever built at the Valmet plant in Finland. [ 3 ] In the 1985 model year, Saab deleted the 2-carburettor engine and simplified the naming again. The entry-level model with the single carburettor was only called "900" and the models with the 8V injection engine were called "900i". Depending on the market, models with the 8V Turbo engine were simply called either "900 Turbo". Models with the 16V turbo engine were called "900 Turbo 16" or (with special equipment "900 Turbo 16 S").
The nomenclature GL and GLs was discontinued from 1985 onwards. Now, the base 900 had the single-carburettor engine. Two turbocharged models were offered: The 900 Turbo had the 8-valve engine, while the Turbo 16 (also Aero) had the 16-valve intercooled unit. Wheel trims (naturally aspirated cars) and alloys (turbos) were redesigned, and the Turbos also received chromed grilles. [ 3 ] The 8-valve turbo received an intercooler for 1986, bringing up power to 155 PS (114 kW), while the 16-valve cars had hydraulic engine mounts. The eight-valve Turbo was also available as a two-door. Side marker lights at the rear of the front fenders were also added, while the 900i gained new interior fabrics. [ 3 ] The new Saab-Scania badge was introduced, placed in the steering wheel, on the bonnet, and on the bootlid. 1986 also marked the introduction of the 16-valve 900i 16 and 900 convertible, both only for North America initially. 1987 facelift [ edit ] Facelifted Saab 900 sedan with composite headlamps and integrated bumpers (Australia) Facelifed Saab 900 3-door hatchback (Australia) A new grille, headlamps , front turn signal lights and "integrated" bumpers freshened the 900's look for 1987, though the sheetmetal was largely unchanged. Several common parts for the 900 and 9000 were introduced for 1988 model year, including brakes and wheel hubs. This also meant that Saab finally abandoned the use of parking brakes on the front wheels, in favor of the rear wheels. [ 8 ] Power steering was added on the 900i. The base 900, available with two or four doors, kept the pre-facelift appearance for 1987. Also new was the carburetted 900c. [ 3 ] The Aero model received slightly bigger fender extensions so as to accommodate larger wheels, while the window trim was blacked out on all models. For 1988 catalytic converters became available with all fuel injected engines in Europe, all with cruise control as standard equipment [ citation needed ] to further help lower emissions. A water- and oil-cooled turbocharger (replacing the older oil-cooled unit) was also introduced to improve the unit's durability. [ 8 ] In each of the seasons 1987 and 1988, there was a special 'one-make' race series, in the UK, called the Saab Turbo Mobil Challenge , sponsored by Saab Great Britain and Mobil . It was run by the BARC . The eight-valve engines were phased out in 1989 and 1990, with the turbo versions taken off North American markets by the end of 1984; North American 900S models received the non-turbo 16-valve engine for 1986. A non-turbo 16-valve engine replaced the 8-valve FI unit in the 900i (900S in North America) as well, while the carbureted engines were dropped. In Europe the eight-valve Turbo dropped out with the 1989 model year, with the limited production 900 T8 Special built to celebrate end of production. 805 were built for Sweden, featuring Aero trim and equipment. [ 3 ] The 900i 16 arrived in Europe, with 128 PS (94 kW; 126 hp). Anti-lock brakes were introduced as well, and were standard on Turbo models. High-mounted rear brake lights appeared during 1988, and power of the catalyzed Turbo 16 Aero jumped from 160 to 175 PS (118 to 129 kW; 158 to 173 hp). [ 3 ] Larger pinion bearings were fitted to manual gearboxes for 1989 to improve their strength and reliability. For 1990, the eight-valve engine was taken out of production while a low-pressure turbo engine with 145 PS (107 kW; 143 hp) was available in European markets. ABS brakes and driver's side airbags were standardized for all North American market cars beginning with the 1990 model year. In the spring of 1990 the naturally aspirated 900i 16 Cabriolet was added. [ 3 ] A 2.1 L (2,119 cc; 129 cu in) ( B212 ) engine, bored out by 3 mm (0.12 in), was introduced in 1991. This engine was available in the United States until the end of the original 900, but in most of Europe, this engine saw limited availability because of tax regulations in many European countries for engines with a displacement of more than 2000 cc. In Sweden, the 2.1-16 was introduced in late summer 1991 for the 1992 model year and had 140 PS (103 kW) rather than the 128 PS (94 kW) of the 2.0. [ 9 ] The 2.1 was made standard fitment on the naturally aspirated Cabriolet, except in markets where the tax structure did not suit it. Front seats from the 9000 were standard from 1991 on and electronically adjustable units were available as an option. Airbags became available as an option in Europe as well, while there was also an Aero trim of the Cabriolet. The 900 no longer offered the mesh wheels. There was also a change in the door locks, which carried over to the 900NG. For 1992 there were mostly equipment adjustments, with ABS brakes finding their way into most of the lineup everywhere. [ 3 ] 1993 brought no changes, and "classic" 900 production ended on 26 March 1993. The final classic convertibles were still sold as 1994 models. Production of the 900 "classic" totaled 908,817 units, including 48,888 convertibles. Influenced by then owner General Motors (GM), in 1994 Saab introduced the New Generation (NG) 900 SE, based on the Opel Vectra chassis. While this design contained styling cues reminiscent of the classic 900, the 900 (NG) was fundamentally a different car. Convertible [ edit ] Saab 900 convertible prototype with luggage rack, later available as an accessory Saab 900 convertible In the mid-1980s, the president of Saab-Scania of America (U.S. importer owned by Saab AB), Robert J. Sinclair , suggested a convertible version to increase sales. The first prototype was built by ASC, American Sunroof Company (now American Specialty Cars ). Similarly, Lynx Motors International Ltd produced two cars, just prior to the official 1986 launch. The Trollhättan design department, headed by Björn Envall , based its version on the 3-door hatchback while the Finnish plant used the sturdier 2-door sedan version, with the latter being selected for production as it was deemed more attractive. A limited production run was initially planned but due to the high influx of orders, production was extended. The new car was shown for the first time at the Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) in the autumn of 1983. The first prototype generated enormous interest and in April 1984, Saab decided to put the car in production at Valmet Automotive in Finland. The production of the first 900 convertible started during the spring of 1986. The convertible usually had a 16-valve turbocharged engine, with some trim levels equipped with the intercooler, but it was also offered in certain markets with a fuel-injected 2.1 L naturally aspirated engine from 1991 onwards. The cabriolet/convertible, was made on the 'classic' chassis for an additional year after the discontinuation of the 900 Classic in 1994. In US and Canadian markets, commemorative versions were produced for 1994 featuring special charcoal metallic "Nova Black" paint, wooden trim for the dashboard, black leather piping on the seats and higher-performing engines. Engine development [ edit ] Saab introduced a turbocharger in 1978 in its 99 Turbo with the B engine (based on the Triumph Slant-4 engine ). This engine was also used in early 900 Turbo models. For 1981 the B-engine was re-designed as the H engine, which was used through to 1993 (and 1994 cabriolets). Unlike the earlier version, the H-engine is very durable. [ 10 ] Saab used Bosch -made mechanical K-Jetronic continuous fuel injection in the fuel injected and 8-valve turbocharged versions, and the Bosch LH 2.2, 2.4 and 2.4.2 and Lucas Automotive electronic fuel injection systems were used in the 16-valve versions. The 2.1 L inline-four 16-valve engine used the Bosch LH 2.4.2 EZK electronic ignition system with a knock sensor. 1981 was also the first year that the Turbo was available with an automatic transmission. The four-speed manual option disappeared after this year. [ 10 ] What set the 900 Turbo apart from its turbo-equipped competitors, especially in the early- and mid-1980s, was the development and use of the Automatic Performance Control (APC) boost controller from 1982. The system allowed the engine to run at the limits of engine knocking. The system had a knock sensor attached to the intake side of the engine block and if knocking of any kind was present, the APC-system would decrease the charge pressure by opening a wastegate , a bypass to the exhaust. This enabled the use of various octane fuels and also made the use of the turbocharger safer for the engine. Some 900 Aeros, Carlssons and Commemorative Editions had special APC controllers in red and black enclosures that provided more boost and increased power to 175 hp (130 kW) or 185 hp (138 kW) without a catalytic converter. By 1983, Saab had sold 100,000 turbo-charged cars. [ 11 ] At first, Saab used a Garrett T3 turbocharger, which was oil-cooled. From 1988 through 1990, water-cooled T3s were fitted. In 1990, Saab fitted Mitsubishi TE-05 turbochargers in the SPG models only for the US; for other countries, and for the US from 1991, all 900 Turbos were fitted with the TE-05. Also water-cooled, the TE-05 was slightly smaller than the Garrett T3, providing improved throttle response and quicker spool-up. The TE-05's exhaust inlet flange utilizes a Garrett T3 pattern. 1981–1994 2.0L B202 H engine 1984–1993 2.0 L B202 T16 Engines [ edit ] 1979–1989: 2.0 L (1,985 cc) B201 NA , single-carb, 101 PS (74 kW; 100 hp) at 5,200 rpm and 162 N⋅m (119 lb⋅ft) 1979–1984: 2.0 L (1,985 cc) B201 NA, dual-carb, 108 PS (79 kW; 107 hp) at 5,200 rpm and 165 N⋅m (122 lb⋅ft) 1979–1989: 2.0 L (1,985 cc) B201 NA, FI , 118 PS (87 kW; 116 hp) at 5,500 rpm and 167 N⋅m (123 lb⋅ft) at 3700 rpm 1979–1985: 2.0 L (1,985 cc) B201 Turbo , 145 PS (107 kW; 143 hp) at 5,000 rpm and 235 N⋅m (173 lb⋅ft) 1986–1989: 2.0 L (1,985 cc) B201 Intercooled turbo, 140–155 PS (103–114 kW; 138–153 hp) at 5,000 rpm and 235 N⋅m (173 lb⋅ft) 1984–1993: 2.0 L (1,985 cc) B202 16-valve turbo, 160–175 PS (118–129 kW; 158–173 hp) at 5,500 rpm and 255 N⋅m (188 lb⋅ft)-273 N⋅m (201 lb⋅ft) 1987–1993: 2.0 L (1,985 cc) B202 16-valve, NA, 126–130 PS (93–96 kW; 124–128 hp) at 6,000 rpm and 170 N⋅m (125 lbf⋅ft)-177 N⋅m (131 lb⋅ft) 1990–1993: 2.0 L (1,985 cc) B202 16-valve low pressure turbo (LPT), 145 PS (107 kW; 143 hp) at 5,600 rpm and 202 N⋅m (149 lb⋅ft) –1994: 2.0 L (1,985 cc) B202 16-valve intercooled turbo (FPT) in the convertible. 1991–1993: 2.1 L (2,119 cc) B212 NA, FI, 140 PS (103 kW; 138 hp) at 6,000 rpm and 230 N⋅m (170 lb⋅ft) Performance [ edit ] Saab 900i; 118 PS (DIN).

Only 300 units were built. These had the 1,985 cc 8-Valve engine with Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection. Interior trim was blue turbo velour with a special gear knob with the car's number. Outside, the model was a standard non-turbo apart from alloy wheels, Tjugofem pinstriping and Turbo style rear spoiler. 900c [ edit ] The 900c was built in Uusikaupunki , Finland and in Arlöv , Sweden just outside Malmö, was a late 1980s carburetted model. It used an eight-valve B201 engine with a single carburettor rated at 100 PS (74 kW; 99 hp) and included power steering as standard equipment. Prototype 900 SPG in Mother of Pearl White.

In North America, the model designation became SPG (Special Performance Group – per Saab USA's own literature – SAAB data correctly refers to it as Sports PacKage) due to a model and trademark conflict with GM in English speaking countries and the US. In the UK it was known as the T16S. The Aero/SPG was the first Saab to be delivered with the 160 hp (119 kW; 162 PS) 16-valve turbocharged engine. The most notable difference from the 900 Turbo was the body kit that wrapped around the car and the specialty wheels. The engine was tuned to produce higher output. The SPG also had a lowered and stiffer suspension. These prototypes were painted a mother of pearl white and had red leather interiors with matching Colorado Red dashboards. Unfortunately, during testing, the colour was found to be too difficult to repair in terms of color, and as such, this color was never offered to the public for sale. Only 29 of these prototype Aero/SPGs were manufactured. The factory retained, and subsequently destroyed, 22 of the white prototypes. The remaining seven vehicles were employed as press vehicles for the series launch. In 1984, the first year of consumer production, the Aero/SPG was delivered in black and in silver (in markets other than US). In Australia the 1985 models painted in silver colour had a dark red leather interior. In the US, cars painted in black colour were featured tan leather interiors. In Canada and in the rest of the world, the cars were black with red leather interiors. Production of the SPG was extremely limited and paint color availability varied by year. The final year of production was 1991 in the US. In total, over the course of six years, 7,625 SPGs were built and imported to North America. In the rest of the world, Aeros were equally rare—especially those equipped with leather interiors, A/C and other amenities. 900EP (900S) [ edit ] The EP was a special Ecopower model for the Italian market. It uses a 16 valve low pressure turbo (LPT) engine and has a pre-heated catalytic converter. It was sold outside Italy with a 900S badge. 900 CD [ edit ] 1985 Saab 900CD In 1977 Saab's Finnish subsidiary Saab-Valmet (Today Valmet Automotive ) had created an elongated executive model of the 99 combi coupé named Finlandia . With the introduction of the 900, the concept was transferred onto the new chassis. The Finlandia was 20 cm (7.9 in) longer than standard, by adding 10 cm (3.9 in) to the front and rear doors, but only the rear leg room was larger. The idea behind the car was to produce an executive car which would appeal to the Nordic market as an option to big German and US sedans. The first cars were sold as the Saab 900 Finlandia. These cars made between 1979 and 1982 were combi coupés, and did not have the 'CD' designation. Very few examples of these early models were exported outside of Finland. After the more elegant 4-door sedan was introduced, the CD designation replaced the nickname and the Swedish Saab headquarters started to officially offer the car for export. The 900 CD was made at the Valmet Automotive factory in Uusikaupunki , Finland. At least in the domestic market, the cars were essentially built to the buyer’s wishes. The list of optional extras for the CD included a leather interior, reading lights, rear blinds, footrests, and even an in-car telephone. However, due to the cars’ special nature and demanding customer base, the trim and technical specifications of some examples can be unique. The Uusikaupunki factory clearly had high aspirations for the car. Valmet Automotive even developed a prototype of an even longer, seven seat limousine as a concept car of an official state car . These aspirations were moderately met, although the Finnish government did not actually ever commission Saab to build such a car, the Saab 900CD was favoured as an official executive vehicle by several local municipalities, such as the city of Oulu, and several larger corporations in the wood and paper industry and electronics manufacture industry. It was also used by the Finnish government as the official state car of the Prime Minister during The Second Government of Mauno Koivisto between 1979 and 1982. He was particularly fond of its performance as it was equipped with a turbocharged engine, and he could thus out-run his bodyguards’ Saab 900's which were naturally aspirated. In total, 579 cars were built between 1979 and 1986. 900 Springtime in Sweden [SIS] [ edit ] In 1988, Saab commissioned 288 special models of the 900 convertibles, one for each of its United States dealers, as part of the 1988 Dealer Meeting in Sweden. Dubbed the Springtime in Sweden, or "SiS" model, these cars are differentiated by their Aero/SPG-like bodywork and 3-spoke wheels. Each car was painted black, with buffalo grey leather interiors and black convertible roofs. Each car was marked with a special "Springtime in Sweden" emblem that was attached to the lower left of the glove box door. The emblems were all identical and are not serialized. All were Turbo models. [ citation needed ] Of the 288 built, approximately 4 were automatics and the remaining 284 had 5-speed manual transmissions, per Saab records. Emblems on the exterior body were deleted in the scheme of the SPG, with only the word Saab and the Saab-Scania roundel on the trunk appearing on the car. The car was fitted with the standard Saab grille for the period, but did not feature the miniature "turbo emblem." The SPG suspension was not fitted, and aside from the SPG body fairings and dash emblem, the SIS is identical to a standard 1988 900 Turbo Convertible in the black/gray color combination. [ citation needed ] The SiS models were sold, one to each dealer, however some dealers used the opportunity to trade their SiS convertible with other dealers in an effort to get other car models (specifically the 9000CD) for sale. Contrary to popular belief, the SIS was not given to the dealers for free. Dealers paid for their own car, the invoice price even reflected the increased cost of the SPG bodywork. Each dealer did, however, receive an Orrefors crystal vase, engraved with the Saab-Scania logo, packed in the trunk when the SIS was delivered stateside as a surprise gift. [ citation needed ] Some individuals, in an attempt to demonstrate the provenance of their vehicles, point to a sticker behind the driver side door card that reads, in part, "AERO" and "CABRIO". This sticker was once affixed to all Saab 900 convertibles and does not designate the vehicle as part of the SiS series. Numerous vehicles are inaccurately listed for sale or referred to as authentic SiS models. There have also been reports of SiS glove box badges being stolen or replicated. One indicator of an authentic SiS is the inclusion of the SiS glove box badge, along with the original window sticker and matching VINs. [ citation needed ] 900 Enduro [ edit ] The Enduro was a special version of the 1980 900 Turbo assembled by Saab Scania Australia Pty. Ltd.; only eleven 900 Enduros were made along with a full body kit as a spare. [ 15 ] Ken Matthews Prestige (a large Sydney-based Saab dealer at the time) were originally commissioned by Saab Australia to oversee the design and implementation of the overall engineering package, with the body modifications themselves designed and built by Purvis Cars of "Eureka" fame. [ 16 ] The package consisted of large fibreglass wheel arches to accommodate the extra track width 4 inches (100 mm) front and 9 inches (230 mm) rear, front air dam and rear fiberglass spoiler fully 2 inches (51 mm) wider than normal 900 Turbo of that year. Extra gauges (oil pressure [0 to 500kPa – 0 to 75 psi], battery voltage [10 to 16 volts] and ammeter [-50 to +50 A]) were mounted where the radio usually was. The radio was moved to a new lower centre console that was not fitted to the 1980 model as standard. It was Eurovox MCC-9090R cassette player and radio with Voxson VX-89 graphic equaliser powering 6 speakers – 2x4" full range front, 2x1" dome tweeter overhead and 2x6" tri-axial rear. Apart from this, the car had a standard turbo version interior with green seats and triangular center steering wheel. The cars were fitted with either gold or black-centred (depending on body colour) Simmons 'P-4' 3-piece composite alloy 7.5x15" wheels with polished lip. The overall outside edge-to-edge distance is 4 in (100 mm) wider at the front and 9 in (230 mm) at the rear over a 900 Turbo of the day – mainly to decrease the roll centre height and improve turn-in response. Tyres were 225/50VR15 Pirelli Cinturato P7 units in the front and rear. Spare wheel was a full size steel rim 5x15" with Michelin 175/70HR15 tyre. Suspension was improved with 290 mm (free length) by 17 mm 368 lb 7.1 turn springs up front and 300 mm (free length) by 16 mm 484 lb 9 turn springs at the rear. Steering caster was set to +2.25 deg +/- .25 deg, camber to -1.75 deg +/- .25 deg and toe in was 2.5 mm +/- 0.5 mm. To increase performance, the waste gate was set at 17 psi (1.2 bar), which delivered a claimed 175 hp (130 kW) from its 8-valve B201 slant-4 engine. Upstream water injection came standard. Paint was a 2-pack Dulux Acran enamel and came in at least four known colours: 137B "Aquamarine Blue Metallic" and a very light green (almost white) referred to as 152G "Marble White". There was at least one Enduro painted in 121B "Solar Red" and a fourth in 148B "Acacia Green Metallic". The hood, side window frames and rear deck were painted in Dulux GT Satin Black. Large "ENDURO" (in 99 TURBO style font) stripes were emblazoned on the hood, the rear deck and along both sides at sill level, although not all vehicles were treated to the "Enduro" hood graphics. None of the cars are known to be ever exported from Australia, but it's believed that no more than 6 examples survived to this day, with only 3 of them actually known. 2 of those were already extensively modified over the years, one awaiting full restoration. Some of the cars had the wheel centre replaced from Simmons P-4 to deeper dish V-4 version. There is also known a "half-Enduro" car, now owned by a real Enduro owner. The Saab dealer in Adelaide did the same Enduro fiberglass bodykit for their showcar (with a paint scheme of then non-existent 900 Lux) and advertised the conversion option for $5000. This was quickly put to an end as the dealer chose not to risk his dealership agreement with Saab. [ 17 ] 900 Lux [ edit ] 900 'Lux' with a Toppola camper shell The Lux was a special model available 1983 and 1984. It came in a two-tone paint, usually slate blue metallic on top and silver below. It had a three-spoke steering wheel or more rarely four-spoke. It was one of the rarest models sold by the company, but the number produced is unknown. 900 SE [ edit ] The SE model was produced in May 1990 and was sold as a 5-door hatchback. A special colour called Iridium Blue with blue pinstripes down the sides. The car also featured multi-spoke alloys, full suite of electric equipment, grey leather seats, and wood effect as standard. Only 300 were originally made for the UK-market, with a choice of either a 2.0L N/A engine or 2.0L LPT version. [ 18 ] Later more SE versions were made, e.g. the US-market SE Turbo convertible (1991), which gained the SPG's body kit and wheels, and the 3-door LPT 900 SE Aero (1993). However, these were not part of the original limited run. [ citation needed ] 900 Carlsson [ edit ] The Carlsson was a special edition 900 produced in honour of Erik Carlsson , of which only 600 examples were sold in the three years it was in production (1990 to 1992) and only available in the UK. It is thought by most that there were only 200 examples sold but in fact there were 200 examples sold for each of those three years. The standard colours which were offered were white, black or red but at the end of production, customers had the choice to order the Carlsson in a bespoke colour. All 900 Carlssons were 3-door hatchbacks, had a body coloured AirFlow body kit, were fitted with twin chrome exhausts, whaletail rear spoiler and were powered by the 1,985 cc turbocharged engine with an upgraded (Red) APC producing 185 hp (138 kW; 188 PS). The 900 Carlsson was also equipped with the "Type 8" primary gear set. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] [ 21 ] 1993 and 1994 Commemorative Editions [ edit ] 314 Commemorative Edition 900 Turbo 3-door Hatchback Coupés were made for the U.S. market in 1993. All the cars were painted solid black with a tan leather interior and had 5-speed manual transmissions. The horsepower was increased to 185 bhp (138 kW) by outfitting the cars with the "red box" APC controller, a 2.8-bar fuel pressure regulator (base turbo was 2.5 bar), and a distributor with enhanced vacuum advance. The cars rode on the SPG suspension. The interior was further embellished by a walnut dash facia and a leather gear knob and gaiter. The wheels were 15" directionals painted medium-gray metallic units with a polished lip. Each Commemorative Edition was shipped with a small brass plaque indicating its number in the series. The plaques were serialized to indicate its number out of 325. [ 22 ] However, only 314 were actually built. In addition, 15 identically equipped cars were shipped to Canada, and were equipped with metric (kilometer) speedometer instruments. [ citation needed ] 500 Commemorative Edition 900T convertibles were delivered to the U.S. market in 1994. They were the last 500 classic 900 convertibles to be built. They had the same performance modifications as the 1993 Commemorative Edition vehicles with the exception of the lower SPG suspension. They all had the 5-speed manual transmission, and came with the same uniquely styled wheels, walnut dash facia, and leather gear knob and gaiter. The tan leather interior was further enhanced with black piping, which was exclusive to this model. The cars were all painted Nova Black Metallic (another feature exclusive to the 1994 Commemorative Edition) and had tan canvas tops. 500 identically equipped cars were shipped to Canada but have metric instruments. The 1994 CE vehicles did not have a plaque designating or celebrating the series. The VIN numbers do however run sequentially which, along with the Ruby, were the only Saab special edition series to do so. [ 23 ] Saab 900 Ruby 900 Ruby [ edit ] Only available in the UK, the Ruby had the 185 bhp (138 kW; 188 PS) 'Carlsson' engine but no body kit. All were in 'Ruby' Red and can be distinguished from other 900s by the colour-coded bumpers and grey (rather than silver) alloy wheels. They also had the unique air-conditioned interior of buffalo leather with Zegna pure wool inserts in the seats and door panels. There were 150 examples, which were the last classic style 900s sold in the UK. Swedish Special Edition [ edit ] 15 rarer LHD "Ruby" versions were also produced. 8 were made available to the Swedish market, known as the "Swedish Special Edition" [ 24 ] and the rest were scattered in Europe. They were identical to the UK spec but had a more refined lower dash or knee guard and electric front seats. Conversions [ edit ] Saab 900 Safari Lynx Engineering produced two "convertible" models, just prior to the official 1986 launch. A demountable camper module, the Toppola , was created for the 3/5-door hatchback. Coachbuilder Nilsson built a wagon variant, the 'Safari'. There were also a few limousine conversions. A typical modification is a 20 cm wheelbase stretch. Dealer models [ edit ] This article needs additional citations for verification .

Find sources: "Saab 900" – news · newspapers · books · scholar · JSTOR ( November 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Some Saab dealers made special models. Saab Wimbledon made the Sprint and the Sport . The Sprint had a special body kit, lower, stiffer springs, and Pirelli Cinturato P7 on 7"x16" wheels. It also came with an intercooler, full colour-coding and 3-spoke leather steering wheel. The Sport had alloy wheels, full colour-coding and spoilers, uprated suspension, 3-spoke leather steering wheel, Clarion stereo and an electric aerial. Heuschmid GmbH offered options such as tuning, intercooler, suspensions tweaking and custom alloy wheels. EIA Motors of France made a series of 100 naturally aspirated 16 valve tuned to 158 bhp (118 kW; 160 PS). Lynx Motors in the UK made a short run conversion of the two-door 900 shell to a convertible. The Winchester edition was a 4-door slate blue sedan and blue velour interior and wood trims. Saab A.I.M of the Netherlands made two special models; both in an attempt to sell off 8-valve turbos late in the model's life. Red Arrow : a red 900 Turbo 8V two-door (MY 1987 and 1988 – slant nose) with a grey AirFlow body kit and a whale tail spoiler. 150 were planned, 100 with whale tail and SuperInca wheels and 50 without whaletail and with 15-spoke Turbo85 wheels instead. Tan cloth interior with Carlsson steering wheel, manual side mirrors, window and no air-conditioning. [ 25 ] Silver Arrow (MY 1985 and 1986, flat nose): Metallic silver 900 Turbo 8V sedan (known as Tudor or notchback) with special red/anthracite side striping, wooden four-spoke steering wheel and gear knob, aubergine velvet interior, with only manual windows and mirrors. The engine featured an intercooler and produced 155 bhp (116 kW) (no catalytic converter for Silver Arrow, so the Red Arrow made a bit less hp as it had it fitted already). Both 'Arrows' have a 1-150 and 1-200 numbered plaque on the dashboard and also a logo on the sides of the hood – above the fenders and on the back. It is believed that none of Arrows actually reached planned numbers for the limited production run – highest Red Arrow known is 138, Silver Arrow is 186. There are also few convertible versions styled as the Red Arrow (red car with grey AirFlow body kit), with no special version designated to it.

This all-new 900 was produced in 1994 through 1998 model years. In mid-1998 it received over 1100 individual improvements (although some were actually introduced on the 1998 900) and was renamed the Saab 9-3 (in most markets; in the US the new model was introduced in 1999). Variants [ edit ] 5-door hatchback Convertible Variants included 900i (4-cylinder, non-turbo), S (4-cylinder, non-turbo in the US; sometimes turbo in other markets) and SE (4-cylinder turbo or V6) models in three-door hatchback, five-door hatchback and convertible body styles. For 1997 and 1998 only, there was also a Saab 900 Talladega , after a record-breaking endurance test in 1996, on the Talladega Superspeedway . The "S" and "SE" trim levels varied greatly in terms of equipment although in general, the SE trim level included Automatic Climate Control (ACC), leather interiors, wood-trimmed dashboards, and 16-inch wheels. Depending on market, the NG900 was available with a choice of 2.0 L or 2.3 L Saab 16-valve DOHC engines (Saab B204 and B234 ) in naturally aspirated or turbocharged form (2.0 L only), as well as a 2.5 L version of GM's European 54° V6 engine . Engine management for the turbos was by Saab Trionic 5 with Direct Ignition (SDI) and Automatic Performance Control (APC), and for naturally aspirated models by Bosch Motronic fuel injection. A distributor-operated ignition system was provided for naturally aspirated engines in some markets. In contrast to the 'classic' Saab 900 with its longitudinally mounted engine and front-hinged bonnet, the NG900 had a more-common transversely mounted engine with rear-hinged bonnet. The convertible variant was introduced in 1995. Convertibles were produced at the Valmet plant in Finland. Convertibles were available in the "S" and "SE" trim levels. Sensonic [ edit ] The 'Sensonic' clutch variant (available on Turbo models only) provided a manual gear lever as in a standard manual transmission car but omitted the clutch pedal in favor of electronics which could control the clutch faster than an average driver, essentially turning it into a clutchless manual transmission . When the driver started to move the gearshift, a computer-controlled microprocessor would drive an electric motor , in turn, operating a hydraulic actuator connected to the clutch master cylinder , which used hydraulic fluid, and controlled the clutch automatically. [ 28 ] With the car in gear but stationary, the clutch was released only when the throttle was applied. If neither brake nor gas pedal was depressed, a warning tone sounded and a message flashed on the on-board display, and if no action was taken after seven seconds, the engine was shut off. Printed in error, a "Hill Start" function for Sensonic-equipped cars (as described in the owner's manual under "Rolling") was intended to assist in getting underway on hills to prevent rolling forwards or backwards. [ 29 ] However, this feature was not implemented on any production unit. [ 30 ] The 'Sensonic' clutch ceased production when the 900 model was replaced in 1998. Saab Information Display [ edit ] The NG900 introduced the Saab Information Display , or SID (available on S or SE models only), which gave the driver real-time information while driving, such as fuel efficiency and outside temperature. Base specification cars had a digital clock in place of the SID and a non-digital instrument panel with a mechanical odometer (as opposed to the digital odometer on higher-spec models). The SID also controlled other vehicle components, including but not limited to audible warnings for turn signals and the vehicle's horn. NG engines [ edit ] 2.0 L B204I naturally aspirated 16-valve four cylinder, 130 PS (96 kW; 128 hp) 2.0 L B206I naturally aspirated 16-valve four cylinder with no balance shafts , 133 PS (98 kW; 131 hp) 2.0 L B204L 16-valve turbo intercooled , 185 PS (136 kW; 182 hp) 2.3 L B234I naturally aspirated 16-valve four cylinder, 150 PS (110 kW; 148 hp) 2.5 L B258I 24-valve 54º V6 , 170 PS (125 kW; 168 hp) Night Panel [ edit ] Panel illuminated Night Panel One Saab innovation, inspired by the company's roots in aeronautics , was the 'Black Panel' feature available in classic models through the turn of the panel dimming knob, and subsequently available (on S or SE models only), through the touch of a button on the SID (Saab Information Display) digital panel (classics had analog display), which extinguished most instrument panel lights, to eliminate distraction from dash lights during night driving. While active, the SID activated feature permitted darkened instruments to re-illuminate themselves when they required driver attention — if for example, the engine speed increased alarmingly or if the fuel level should drop below 15 litres (4 US gal). [ 31 ] This feature was later renamed 'Night Panel' in Saab 9-3 and Saab 9-5 models. In the later Night Panel version, the speedometer is only illuminated up to the 87 mph/140 km/h mark. The remainder of the scale will only be illuminated if the speed of the car exceeds 84 mph/135 km/h. [ 31 ] 900i [ edit ] This section does not cite any sources .

( November 2024 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Saab 900i 3-door (front) Saab 900i 3-door (rear) Under General Motors, Saab was repositioned as a luxury marque. This meant that the NG900 would be positioned, and priced, above the Opel Vectra , with which it shared its platform. It would also make the base 900i more expensive than the Vectra. This led to cost-reduction measures for the 900i. The 900i would lose its rear-window wiper, the exclusive Saab Information Display , and would utilize a different instrument layout with a mechanical odometer instead of a digital one; early models even lacked a tachometer. The NG900i would also lose its rear spoiler. Some 900i models were later equipped with a standard instrument cluster and the basic SID. The 900i was only available in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan as a three-door or a five-door with a choice of a 2.0 or 2.3 L engine . It did not sell very well in the UK and Australia, where the S and SE models were popular with Saab drivers. It was, however, popular as a cheaper alternative to the S and SE models.
