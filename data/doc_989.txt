[ 2 ] The Royale's predecessor was launched in 1972 by General Motors Korea (GMK) [ n 1 ] as the Rekord , becoming the Saehan Rekord in 1976 when Saehan Motors replaced GMK, until production ended in 1978. This car was a version of the German Opel Rekord D . [ 4 ] The second generation Saehan Rekord was a development of the Opel Rekord E . Production began in 1978, along with the Saehan Royale . The Royale was the Rekord E bodyshell with the front grafted on from the Opel Senator A . The Saehan Royale became the Daewoo Royale in 1983, with Saehan Rekord being discontinued and incorporated into the Royale lineup as the Daewoo Royale XQ . In 1989, the flagship Daewoo Imperial was introduced, based on the standard Royale. While Royale production (excepting taxis) ended in 1991, Imperials continued until 1993, being replaced by the Daewoo Arcadia .

[ 7 ] The GMK Rekord was based on the German-designed Opel Rekord D . [ 8 ] In August 1975, a version of the Rekord, known as the Rekord Royale was launched by GMK. [ 7 ] The Royale version was based on the Opel Commodore B , which was essentially the Opel Rekord with a lengthened engine bay. [ 9 ] 12,005 Royales were produced between 1975 and 1978. [ 10 ] In November 1976, GMK changed its name to Saehan Motors, [ 7 ] and as a result, the Rekord and Rekord Royale became the Saehan Rekord [ 11 ] and Saehan Rekord Royale .

It was introduced in 1978 along with the Saehan Royale , which was essentially the Rekord E, featuring the front-end of the larger Senator A . [ 18 ] In January 1983, after Daewoo gained control, Saehan Motors changed its name to Daewoo Motors. At the same time the Saehan Royale was renamed Daewoo Royale , [ 19 ] and the Saehan Rekord was absorbed in the Royale range, becoming known as the Royale XQ. [ 20 ] Production of the XQ ended in 1987. [ 21 ] 1986–1987 Daewoo Royale Salon Super Until November 1984, Royale body panels were stamped by Holden in Australia, where the Rekord-Senator hybrid was manufactured there as the Holden Commodore . [ 22 ] After November 1984, Daewoo began pressing their own panels on a newly installed production line. [ 22 ] The E1 bodystyle continued to be built as the Royale XQ and Diesel, while the Prince received the Senator A2's front end. All Korean-built shells, however, received a unique rear pressing with large, somewhat sloped rectangular taillights, which increased the length by about 5 cm (2 in). [ 23 ] The Royale Salon continued with the Senator A1 front end until it received a whole new front in 1987. The Royale Salon Super was introduced in 1986. However, unlike other Royales that utilised the Opel Rekord E2 / Senator A2 hybrid with the four-window glasshouse design, the Salon Super used the six-window design from the Senator A. [ 24 ] A second design revision came in 1987 with a new front-end design, featuring a revised grille and headlamps , along with minor trim changes. While lower-specification versions such as the Royale Salon retained the four-window design, the Royale Super Salon continued using the six-window design from the now discontinued Salon Super. [ 25 ] The old-style XQ and Diesel received an all new front end of a smooth, upright, and rectangular appearance. 1989 marked another design change; the Royale Prince inherited a new grille insert and adopted the six-window glasshouse. [ 26 ] From 1989, Daewoo introduced the top-of-the-range Imperial, which was marketed separate from the Royale range. [ 27 ] Imperial production ended in 1993, replaced by the Daewoo Arcadia . [ 28 ] Specification levels [ edit ] External images 1978 : Rekord Royale , Rekord Royale , 1983 : [5] 1985 : Royale XQ , Diesel , Prince , Salon 1987 : Royale Duke , Prince 1500 , Super Salon 1989 : Royale Prince , Imperial Various Daewoo Royale engines were four-cylinder Opel units, [ 29 ] with Daewoo offering the Royale in several different levels of luxury: the Diesel, Salon, Duke, XQ, and Prince: [ 30 ] Royale Diesel [ 31 ] (May 1980–April 1989): As the Royale Duke Diesel from early 1987; fitted with Opel's 2.0-liter diesel engine. [ 32 ] Royale Salon [ 33 ] (September 1980 – September 1991): fitted with a 1979 cc engine and three-speed automatic transmission . This powertrain combination produced 100 PS (74 kW) ( DIN ) and 156 N⋅m (115 ft⋅lb) (DIN). Top speed was claimed at 176 km/h (109 mph). [ 34 ] Royale Salon Super [ 31 ] (March 1986 – 1987): This fully equipped model (digital dashboard, trip computer, EFI, etcetera) uses the Senator's six-window glass house. [ 35 ] Royale Super Salon [ 36 ] (1987–1991): a facelift model of the Royal Salon Super with 2.0-liter EFI engine with trip computer, 9-band Equalizer audio and Seat Heating. [ 37 ] Royale XQ [ 38 ] (August 1983 – 1987): fitted with a 1492 cc engine and four-speed manual transmission . This powertrain combination produced 44 kW (60 PS; 59 hp) (DIN) and 100 N⋅m (74 ft⋅lb) (DIN). Top speed was claimed at 135 km/h (84 mph). [ 39 ] Royale Duke (February 1987 – March 1989): a new lower-end model fitted with a more modern 1498 cc engine. [ 40 ] Duke City (April 1988 – 1989): a version intended for taxi use, fitted with a 1.6-liter LPG engine. This became the Royale Prince LPG (also with a 2-litre engine) after 1989. Royale Prince [ 41 ] (July 1983–June 1991): used the E2 bodywork, fitted with a 1897 cc engine and four-speed manual transmission. This powertrain combination produced 63 kW (86 PS; 84 hp) (DIN) and 142 N⋅m (105 ft⋅lb) (DIN). Top speed was claimed at 168 km/h (104 mph). [ 42 ] Daewoo Imperial [ 43 ] (February 1989 – mid-1993): the Imperial was the ultimate development of the Royale, developed in response to the Hyundai Sonata and Grandeur . [ 28 ] Imperial styling was reminiscent of the contemporary Chrysler Imperial and New Yorker , but also some Japanese luxury sedans. Its formal roofline, and much revised front- and rear-end styling helped to cover up the car's Opel Senator roots. [ 44 ] Imperial was specified with a vinyl roof , Bosch anti-lock brakes , digital instrumentation , cruise control , automatic climate control air conditioning , power windows , power door locks , power steering , a trip computer , and leather upholstery. [ 43 ] A 2969 cc engine and four-speed automatic transmission was also fitted. [ 43 ] This powertrain combination produced 135 kW SAE (184 PS) and 230 N⋅m (170 lb⋅ft), or 115 kW DIN (156 PS). [ 44 ] [ 43 ] Top speed was claimed at 195 km/h (121 mph). [ 45 ] Outdated, and with a negative reputation for quality, the Imperial was outclassed by the new Hyundai Grandeur and only 863 examples were built in a little over four years.
