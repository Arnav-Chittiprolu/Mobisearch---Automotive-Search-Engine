2026 Volkswagen Tiguan Turbo First Test Review: What 268 HP Really Delivers We Tested the 2026 Volkswagen Tiguan Turbo. Here's Where 268 HP Pays Off. An extra 67 hp gives the capital-T Turbo version of VW's small SUV a big push forward. Frank Markus Writer Jim Fets Photographer Dec 05, 2025 See All 48 Photos 48 Not only has every Volkswagen Tiguan ever sold in the USA been powered by a turbocharged spark-ignition (TSI) engine, but they’ve also all been powered by a variant of the same engine: VW’s workhorse EA888 2.0-liter , which has morphed through five generations of development since the Tiguan’s May 2008 U.S. launch . The engineering team is so darned proud of this fifth-gen unit, it convinced the marketing department to ignore the potential confusion and badge the top-spec 2026 Volkswagen Tiguan with the biggest turbocharger “Turbo.” Hey, most Porsche 911s today are turbocharged, and the Turbo nomenclature is working out well there. If it's good enough for Porsche... See All 48 Photos 48 Earning that Capital T The differences between the fourth-gen base engine powering most new Tiguans and the fifth-gen one in the 2026 Tiguan SEL R-Line Turbo are many, but a larger turbo earns most of the credit for the additional 67 horsepower and 37 lb-ft to the tune of 268 horsepower and 258 lb-ft of torque in all. (As we’ve previously noted, increasing the fuel injection pressure and adding variable valve lift to the exhaust cam added 17 hp for the 2025 model year and newer Tiguans equipped with the gen-four engine.) To combat the increased lag a larger turbo can cause, this one is fitted with movable vanes that work like your thumb on a hose, narrowing the nozzle area to speed up the flow of the exhaust gases and more quickly spool the turbine, then opening up to accommodate higher flow rates. Fuel injection pressure is increased again (from the base engine’s 5,100 to 7,250 psi), and the charge-air cooler is integrated directly into the intake manifold. The engine still runs a modified Miller cycle (think Atkinson for turbo/supercharged engines) that VW refers to as the Budack cycle. Basically, it closes the intake valves early under some conditions, reducing the crankshaft’s compression work while retaining full expansion. Regular Gas, Same EPA Combined MPG Increasing output this much on regular 87 octane fuel, with no change in EPA city or combined fuel economy, is darned impressive (highway mileage for the Turbo drops 1 mpg, as there are equipment differences that impact frontal area). These gains are even more impressive when you remember that the latest emissions controls no longer allow full-throttle fuel enrichment—engines must always run “stoichiometric,” 14.7 parts air to 1 part fuel. This requirement drove the higher fuel pressure and standard global fitment of an exhaust particle filter. Other fifth-gen engine features include a nitrided crankshaft , plus stronger connecting rods and pistons. See All 48 Photos 48 How’s It Drive? This is clearly a more athletic Tiguan than we’ve become accustomed to over the years. Drop the hammer, and the turbo spools quickly, whooshing the compact crossover away from a stop with the urgency of the late VW Arteon , which weighed nearly as much and shared the same engine output specs and a similar eight-speed automatic. In MotorTrend testing, the Tiguan SEL R-Line Turbo dashed from 0 to 60 mph in 7.0 seconds, a 1.1-second improvement over a 201-hp 2025 Tiguan SEL R-Line 4Motion. Depress the lovely volume knob on the center console once, then rotate it a click to engage Sport mode (the others are Eco, Comfort, Custom, Off-Road, and Snow). This also engages S mode shifting, which is pretty good about holding gears when slowing for curves, although in some low-speed sections of our drive we still felt the need to grab a downshift paddle and upshifts could be quicker. The chassis at least serves as a perfectly willing partner in the type of driving parents engage in when their impressionable spawn are onboard, and the ride is mercifully supple. The 2026 Tiguan Turbo is no oversized Volkswagen GTI in terms of steering or braking feel (rear brake size is increased slightly over the lower level turbo/AWD model), but the 255/40 all-season tires that wrap around its 20-inch wheels never begged us for mercy while cornering at mild-misdemeanor velocities on twisty rural Michigan roads. Pushed to their limits in our figure-eight track test, they helped the Tiguan achieve a respectable 0.85 g of cornering grip. Under full-force braking, the 4,018-pound Turbo stopped from 60 mph in 111 feet, about 10 feet better than what's typical for the segment. See All 48 Photos 48 Is the Tiguan Turbo Worth the Money? The base price of the 2026 Volkswagen Tiguan SEL R-Line Turbo is $44,560, or $4,340 more than the next closest SE R-Line Black 4Motion. Note that this premium includes a lot of swag, including three-zone climate control, extended 30-color ambient lighting, quilted Varenna leather seats, a heated wheel, ventilated and massaging front seats, heated rear seats, power liftgate, 12-speaker Harman Kardon audio, and more. For reference, that’s about $2,300 more than a top-of-the-line Honda CR-V AWD Sport Touring Hybrid, and about $585 less than a similarly equipped Toyota RAV4 Hybrid Limited . With hybridization, the Honda and Toyota approach the Tiguan Turbo’s performance, but of course those two also achieve roughly 50 percent better fuel economy. There’s no question, however, that the 2026 Tiguan Turbo makes a better first impression than its more efficient competition when settling in behind the wheel. Its interior is vastly dressier and more richly equipped, with bigger screens, snazzier contrasting leather seats, an available Wi-Fi hotspot, and improved smartphone integration that shares phone navigation directions on the driver’s info screen. See All 48 Photos 48 Pressing the volume knob twice lets you toggle between seven cockpit “atmospheres”: Lounge, Nature, Joy, Energetic, Minimal, Me, and Inactive. Each adjusts the ambient lighting, driver-info screen designs, radio volume, and more. As for that seat massage function: It’s legit, featuring 10 actuators that can perform six programs at varying intensity levels. The luxury drops off in the second row, however, with hard plastic door panels surrounding the contrasting-color vinyl insert and no attempt to duplicate the molded-in stitching that adorns the front doors. This perceptible swank in the front row is designed to overwhelm your emotional right brain, shouting down all the rational arguments your left brain will be making in favor of the sensible-shoes Honda CR-V or Toyota RAV4 regarding reliability, resale value, efficiency, and overall cost of ownership.

At 16 I started running parts for an Oldsmobile dealership and got hooked on the car biz. Engineering seemed the best way to make a living in it, so with two mechanical engineering degrees I joined Chrysler to work on the Neon, LH cars, and 2nd-gen minivans. Then a friend mentioned an opening for a technical editor at another car magazine, and I did the car-biz equivalent of running off to join the circus. I loved that job too until the phone rang again with what turned out to be an even better opportunity with Motor Trend. It’s nearly impossible to imagine an even better job, but I still answer the phone… Read More Share You May Also Like MotorTrend Recommended Stories Load More
