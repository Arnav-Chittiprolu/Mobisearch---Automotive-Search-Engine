From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Compact luxury crossover SUV Motor vehicle BMW X3 BMW X3 (G45) Overview Manufacturer BMW Production 2003–present Body and chassis Class Compact luxury crossover SUV ( D ) Body style 5-door SUV The BMW X3 is a compact luxury crossover SUV manufactured by BMW since 2003, based on the BMW 3 Series platform. BMW markets the car as a Sports Activity Vehicle , the company's proprietary descriptor for its X-line luxury vehicles. The first-generation X3 was designed by BMW in conjunction with Magna Steyr of Graz , Austria—who also manufactured all X3s under contract to BMW. BMW manufactured the second-generation X3 at their Spartanburg plant in South Carolina , United States. Starting with the third generation, BMW South Africa's Rosslyn plant began production of the X3, alongside the Spartanburg plant, after the facility underwent a major upgrade to prepare for the X3 production, replacing the long-running 3 Series production in the plant. About 76,000 units will be manufactured there annually. [ 1 ] The car was the first mid-size, premium SUV on the market. [ 2 ] In 2008, BMW started competing with the Mercedes-Benz GLK-Class (renamed GLC-Class since 2016), and numerous other SUVs in this segment. The X3 is smaller than the X5 and X6 , and bigger than the X1 and the X2 . The battery electric model is sold as the BMW iX3 .

The E83 was designed by BMW in conjunction with Magna Steyr of Graz , Austria who also manufactured all first-generation X3s under contract to BMW. Interior As a precursor to the X3, in 2003 BMW presented the xActivity concept vehicle at the Detroit Auto Show featuring the 3 Series platform and a fixed-profile convertible body style with reinforced longitudinal rails connect the A-pillars to the rear of the car on both sides, eliminating B- or C-pillars. The X3 premiered in September 2003 at the Frankfurt Auto Show (Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung) , sharing its rear suspension with the E46 330xi and using an automatic four-wheel drive system marketed as xDrive . All X3 models feature BMW's all-wheel drive system , with a default 40:60 torque split between the front and rear axles and the ability to direct all torque to either axle. The system used an electronically controlled multiple-plate clutch to enable infinitely adjustable, fully variable distribution of torque from front to rear with the capability of up to 100 per cent of engine torque going to either axle. BMW markets the crossover as a Sports Activity Vehicle , the company's descriptor for its X-line of vehicles. The X3 was conceived to combine the agility of a compact model with the driving experience of the company's X5. The X3 featured an upright, high H-point seating configuration, marketed as "command seating". Styling exhibited interacting concave and convex surfacing, characteristic for the company at the time along with a reinterpreted Hofmeister kink . BMW upgraded the model in 2005 and facelifted the model in 2007, with revised body bumpers, engine, interior trim, and suspension. The X3 3.0i won the Canadian Car of the Year Best Sports Utility Vehicle award for 2005. The X3 was initially criticised for its harsh ride, austere interior, lack of off-road capability and high price. [ 10 ] U.S-spec X3 models were well-equipped, with standard equipment such as: the BMW Business A/M-F/M-CD radio (with optional dealer-activated Bluetooth functionality for wireless phones), an eight-speaker premium audio system, leatherette-trimmed seating surfaces, dual power front bucket seats, aluminium interior trim accents, keyless entry, and seventeen-inch (17") aluminium-alloy wheels. Optional equipment included a ten-speaker premium audio system with Digital Sound Processing (DSP), Sirius Satellite Radio, a dashboard-mounted colour GPS navigational system that replaced the upper dashboard storage compartment and contained a modified version of BMW's "iDrive" multimedia system, eighteen-inch (and later nineteen-inch) aluminium-alloy wheels, Nevada leather-trimmed seating surfaces, heated front and rear seats, a heated steering wheel, a security system, BMW Assist, a panoramic dual-pane moonroof, Xenon front headlamps with adaptive front headlamps, and sport front bucket seats. 2003–2006 [ edit ] Bluetooth could actually be ordered straight from the factory (part of the Premium Package) and functioned without dealer intervention. (Although the BMW X3 was originally offered and promised with Bluetooth support in 2004, none of the cars that shipped from the factory actually had it installed. Few were able to get it to work with servicing from their dealer.) The interior was upgraded with more consistent plastic panels. Also instead of having grey carpeting which was present on all 2004 X3s, the 2005 X3 came with carpeting that matched the leather ordered (with the exception of the Terracotta interior with black carpeting). Slightly softer suspension. Front fenders are one-piece, as opposed to the two-piece found on 2004 models. A 2.0d engine became available in 2005 for some markets – joining the 2.5i and 3.0i engines (found stateside) as well as the 3.0d engine sold elsewhere in the world. An 'Open-Door' indicator was added on the 2004 models. 2006–2010 [ edit ] For 2006, the U.S.-spec X3 lost its 2.5L M54 inline 6-cylinder engine for the 2.5i model. The only model available from 2006 onwards for the U.S.-spec X3 was the 3.0L M54 inline 6-cylinder engine (later, the N52 inline 6-cylinder engine) and the 3.0i model (later, 3.0Si or xDrive30i ). This further increased the X3's base price. In September 2006, the E83 received a facelift with revised headlights, grille, front bumper, tail lights, rear bumper, and interior. For the 2007 model year, the US market X3 was powered by the N52 inline 6-cylinder engine that debuted on the 2006 E90 3 Series. Internationally, the X3 received smaller engines including the 4-cylinder petrol and diesel options. In Europe, the range started with a 2.0-litre 4-cylinder petrol, a 4cyl. turbo diesel and continues with 6-cylinder turbo & bi-turbo diesels . The largest diesel offered was the sport diesel with 210 kW (282 hp). U.S. market 2006 X3's were equipped with a version of the 'M' technik body kit with unpainted door sills and wheel arches. U.S. spec Sport Package 2006 X3's received the full 'M' body kit (with painted front, side and rear plastic) available internationally as a factory accessory. 2.5i was removed for sale from the U.S. and Adaptive headlamps and a panoramic sunroof were made available, as well as upgraded dashboard components and leather seating. Since September 2008, the Edition Exclusive and Edition lifestyle were available. The M-Sport Package was replaced in March 2009 by the Sport Limited Edition.

The vehicle was unveiled in 2010 at the 2010 Paris Motor Show . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] For this generation, production moved from Magna Steyr in Austria to at BMW's United States plant in Greer, South Carolina . [ 27 ] Production started on 1 September 2010, [ 28 ] and ended in August 2017. [ 29 ] Dimensions-wise, the F25-based X3 is almost as large as the original E53 series X5 . [ 30 ] At launch, all models use all-wheel drive , badged as xDrive. Transmission choices are a six-speed manual or eight-speed ZF 8HP automatic transmission . The emission standard for all engines was Euro 5, until the June 2014 LCI facelift when all diesels became Euro 6. [ 31 ] A rear-wheel drive only model called sDrive was added to the range in some markets in 2012. [ 32 ] M Performance Parts were released in the facelift and can be installed to all models. These include carbon fibre mirrors, a sport steering wheel, M rims, black kidney grilles and Aluminium pedals. 30d models also get a power boost kit making 27 hp more (286 hp) and 18d and 20d models can be fitted with a dual exhaust. Europe UK models went on sale on 18 November 2010. Early UK models included the xDrive20d. [ 33 ] xDrive30d was added in April 2011. [ 34 ] xDrive35d was added from September 2011. [ 35 ] sDrive18d was added on 20 August 2012. [ 36 ] From early 2013, the latest generation of BMW Professional Navigation System became available. [ 37 ] North America US models arrived in US BMW Centres by the end of 2010 as 2011 model year vehicles. Early US models included xDrive28i, xDrive35i. [ 38 ] In 2013 model year (produced in April 2012 and delivered in May 2012), a turbo four cylinder xDrive28i was introduced as replacement for the inline six xDrive28i, with new features such as standard Auto Start/Stop, Driving Dynamics Control with ECO PRO, New Driver Assistance Package (includes Lane Departure Warning ). [ 39 ] All US market vehicles come with an 8-speed automatic transmission. For 2011, the F25 X3 is available in the US, only with a 3.0-liter inline six-cylinder gasoline engine either normally aspirated or with a twin-scroll turbocharger. In 2012, the F25 X3 xDrive28i model's 3.0L naturally aspirated inline six-cylinder gasoline engine was replaced by the 2.0L TwinPower twin-scroll, single-turbo inline four-cylinder gasoline engine that was first introduced on the BMW 3 Series (F30) , the BMW N20 , more specifically coded N20B20O0. [ 40 ] A rear-wheel-drive sDrive28i model joined the X3 model line-up, marking the first non-xDrive BMW SAV to ever be sold in the United States. In 2013, the F25 X3 xDrive28d model joined the X3 line-up, powered by a 2.0L turbocharged inline four-cylinder diesel engine, again first introduced on the BMW 3 Series (F30) .

The XD3 is fitted with an Alpina-modified version of BMW's B57 diesel inline-six engine. In the quad-turbo left-hand drive version, the engine outputs 285 kW (382 hp) and 770 N⋅m (568 lbf⋅ft), giving a 0–100 km/h (62 mph) time of 4.6 s and a top speed of 266 km/h (165 mph). In the bi-turbo right-hand drive version, the engine outputs 245 kW (329 hp) and 700 N⋅m (516 lbf⋅ft), giving it a 0–100 km/h (62 mph) time of 4.9 s and a top speed of 254 km/h (158 mph). Alpina XD3 at Geneva Motorshow 2018 Alpina XD3 at Geneva Motorshow 2018 Alpina XD3 BMW iX3 (G08; 2020) [ edit ] The BMW iX3 (model code G08 ) is a battery electric version of the BMW X3 (G01). [ 74 ] It was presented at the 2018 Beijing Motor Show in April as a concept vehicle, it is the third car of the electric-focused BMW i family and the first battery electric BMW SUV. Production began in September 2020 at BMW's factory in Dadong , Shenyang, China. [ 75 ] [ 76 ] It will not be available in Taiwan, United States, and Canada, reportedly due to the vehicle's limited range and sole rear-wheel-drive configuration for the North American market. [ 77 ] [ 78 ] The production version of the BMW iX3 was unveiled in July 2020. It has an 80 kWh battery pack with 73.83 kWh [ 79 ] usable capacity, which delivers up to 460 km (290 mi) of range based on the WLTP . The iX3 is powered by a single electric motor on the rear axle that produces 210 kW (282 hp) and accelerates from 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) in 6.8 seconds. It has an electronically limited top speed of 180 km/h (112 mph). [ 80 ] The electric powertrain is BMW's fifth-generation scalable electric drivetrain that is distinguished by a more compact design than that used by the BMW i3 with the electric motor, transmission, and power electrics grouped together in a single component. It does not feature rare-earth materials in its construction and allows BMW to significantly reduce production costs over the old model. [ 81 ] The batteries consists of 188 prismatic cells and are positioned on the floor, lowering the centre of gravity by 75 mm. [ 80 ] Supported for 150 kW DC fast charging, the iX3 can be charged from 0 to 80 per cent in 34 minutes or 100 kilometres (62 mi) in 10 minutes. It has 510 litres (18 cu ft) of boot space, 40 L (1.4 cu ft) smaller than in a conventional X3. [ 75 ] It features adaptive flat LED headlights, 19-inch bi-colour wheels, three-dimensional LED taillights, it also features a BMW Live Cockpit Professional along with a 12-inch digital display and a 12-inch central touch screen and leather seats. [ 82 ] In 2025, the NA5 iX3 was released as the successor to the G08. It will be sold alongside the gasoline-powered G45 X3.

[ 86 ] For the first time in the model history, the X3 is available with a long wheelbase (LWB) version, codenamed G48, exclusive for the Chinese market. [ 87 ] Unlike the previous model, BMW confirmed that the flagship M high-performance model will not be produced for the X3 G45, therefore the M Performance M50 model served as the highest performance internal combustion model of the X3 G45. BMW instead focused on developing the M model of the battery-electric powered iX3 .
