It is built on a body-on-frame chassis, and powered by turbocharged four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines. [ 3 ] It was unveiled simultaneously in two locations on 29 October 2024 at the Jeddah International Motor Show in Saudi Arabia , and in Hobart , Tasmania , Australia. [ 4 ] Etymology [ edit ] The vehicle is named after the Tasman Sea , located between Australia and New Zealand . According to Kia, the name was chosen due to the importance of the Australian and New Zealand markets for the vehicle. [ 5 ] Overview [ edit ] The Tasman will be produced in South Korea, with Australia targeted to be one of the main markets for the vehicle. Kia claimed the Tasman will be "the most Australian vehicle" it has ever developed. [ 6 ] Kia Australia claimed a major involvement in the development of the pickup truck, and targeted around 10 percent of pickup truck market share in the country once the Tasman went on sale. [ 7 ] The Tasman will be built on an all-new platform, and slated to compete with the Ford Ranger , Isuzu D-Max , Mitsubishi Triton , Nissan Navara and Toyota Hilux , and will match their braked towing capacity of 3,500 kg (7,700 lb) and a payload of around 1,000 kg (2,200 lb). [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The name 'Tasman' was confirmed in April 2024, [ 10 ] before the first official appearance of the Tasman on 23 April 2024, when Kia Australia released images showing the vehicle wrapped in artistic camouflage sticker designed by local artist Richard Boyd-Dunlop. [ 11 ] The Tasman, which required four years of development and more than 18,000 quality tests. Every Kia design studio worldwide contributed twenty initial Tasman design studies to the project. They were later reduced to three final full-size proposals shown to Kia regions and the winner was subsequently chosen. The Tasman has also been subjected to substantial clinics with potential buyers over the last 12 months. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] The Tasman is offered with four bed accessory configurations: Single Decker, Double Decker, Sports Bar and Ladder Rack. There are chassis cab and single cab models. [ 14 ] The Tasman Weekender concept was unveiled on 8 April 2025.

The design department within Kia has created something unique and there are a lot of positive responses from it [...] We knew we had to do something creative and different. And this is the beginning of a journey for Kia as well of course.
