It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages , or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories (except for eponymous maintenance categories). This is a tracking category . It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme . This category is hidden on its member pages —unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. These categories can be used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse " (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list ( discriminated by classifications ). This category combines all articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases from October 2025 (2025-10) to enable us to work through the backlog more systematically. It is a member of Category:Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases . Articles are automatically put into this monthly category by inline templates such as {{ weasel inline }} , {{ by whom }} , {{ who }} , and {{ which }} , which mark specific words as " weasel words ". (Do not add this category directly.) The key to improving weasel words in articles is either a) to name a source for the opinion or b) to change opinionated language to concrete facts. After you have made any necessary edits, remove the template.
