From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This article is about a car model produced by the South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai. For the Hyundai marque, see Genesis Motor . Motor vehicle Hyundai Genesis 2015 Hyundai Genesis ( DH ) Overview Manufacturer Hyundai Production 2008–2016 (as Hyundai Genesis) 2016–2020 (as Genesis G80 ) Body and chassis Class Executive car ( E ) Body style 4-door sedan Layout Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive Front-engine, four-wheel-drive Chronology Successor Genesis G80 The Hyundai Genesis ( Korean : 현대 제네시스 ) is an executive car manufactured and marketed by Hyundai Motor Company over two generations from 2008 until 2016, before it was renamed the Genesis G80 . It is a five-passenger, four-door, rear- or all-wheel-drive sedan . Introduced in concept form at the 2007 New York International Auto Show , [ 1 ] and internally designated as the BH model, the Genesis was expected to cost $533 million to develop. [ 2 ] Hyundai began marketing the first generation Genesis worldwide (except in Europe) in 2008 as a "premium sports sedan". [ 3 ] The second generation Genesis (model DH) debuted in Seoul, Korea in November 2013 [ 4 ] [ 5 ] followed by the 2014 North American International Auto Show [ 6 ] and Toronto Auto Show . [ 7 ] On 4 November 2015, Hyundai announced that the name Genesis and Hyundai's second generation luxury model would move to a new and separate luxury division, Genesis Motor . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The Genesis — as a Hyundai model — was replaced in actuality in 2017 when the second generation Hyundai Genesis was renamed the G80 . [ 10 ] The move followed the model's success in the luxury market, paired with consumer acceptance of the Genesis nameplate. [ 11 ] Development and design [ edit ] Hyundai Genesis Concept Introduced in March 2007 as the "Concept Genesis", the sedan was designed by Hyundai as a "progressive interpretation of the modern rear-wheel drive sports sedan". [ 12 ] Hyundai conceived the idea for the Genesis in 2003. The body design took three years and the total cost of the program was $500 million over a development period of 23 months. Reliability testing ran for 800,000 miles. [ 13 ] Hyundai reportedly benchmarked the BMW 5 Series ( E60 ) sedan during the Genesis' development; the company's press release indicates the Genesis body in white exceeds the BMW in torsional rigidity by 14%. [ 14 ] The production Genesis sedan received a five-star crash rating in every category from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Hyundai markets the Genesis as offering "the performance of a BMW 5-Series and the interior packaging of a 7-Series at the price of a 3-Series". [ 17 ] Reviewing the Genesis 4.6 at its US introduction, automotive journalist Dan Neil called the absence of brand emblems at the front of the Genesis "a move that subverts the grammar of luxury".

Notably, the Korean market Genesis does not carry a Hyundai badge, only the 'Genesis' emblem. [ 3 ] [ 47 ] Hyundai has been criticised by Korean consumers over the price discrepancy between the US and Korean markets. Yonhap reports the Genesis costs "₩58.3 million (US$57,000) in Korea, whereas in the U.S. it sells for $32,000." This has led to dumping allegations [ 48 ] and a growing market in reimported Genesises by gray market dealers. Korean regulators are currently investigating whether Hyundai has abused its 75% domestic market share. [ 49 ] [ needs update ] However, Hyundai cars in South Korea have more available options and that may be the reason for the mark-ups. [ citation needed ] Marketed as the Hyundai Genesis in the US and Canada, the vehicle is the largest, most powerful car that Hyundai has ever marketed there before the launch of the Equus. [ 3 ] The Genesis sedan went on sale in the US in August 2008. In its first five months of sales, the Genesis under-performed in the competitive US market selling only 6,167 units. According to Hyundai, Genesis saw sales of just 1,297 units in its first full sales month and the company expected to move around 8000 units from the US showrooms by the end of 2008. [ 50 ] In 2009, the Genesis sold 21,889 units in the U.S. (sedan and coupe combined). [ 51 ] There had been internal discussions within Hyundai about creating a separate brand to feature the Genesis sedan as well as the soon to come Equus sedan in North America, but due to prohibitive costs and potential delays the Genesis and Equus remained tagged with the Hyundai brand [ 52 ] until 2016. In late 2016, The Genesis brand became separate from Hyundai in the United States. The Genesis was not marketed at first in Europe because of Lexus's failure to thrive in Europe. [ 53 ] According to a September 2007 article in Tradingmarkets.com, "in the eyes of European purchasers of luxury vehicles, Hyundai sedans have been perceived as having a poor image and unreliable durability compared with its rivals." [ 54 ] "The planned launch of Genesis comes at a time when Hyundai is striving to shake off its poor-brand image, known for generous warranties and low prices." [ 54 ] The latest Genesis [ clarification needed ] will be sold in Europe, priced at about €65,000 in Germany. [ citation needed ] The Genesis is sold in Latin America in Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Colombia, Chile and Peru, offering versions with engines of 3.3 and 3.8 liters, and in Brazil only with the 3.8 liters engine. Australia was the first country in the Oceania region to get the Genesis sedan, arriving in November 2014. Coupe [ edit ] Main article: Hyundai Genesis Coupe A rear wheel drive sports car from Hyundai, dubbed Hyundai Genesis Coupe and sharing the Genesis Sedan's platform and name, was unveiled at the 2008 New York International Auto Show . Awards [ edit ] The Genesis sedan has received numerous awards and recognitions. Among them: Named one of the top five luxury sedans in 2008 by the National Automobile Dealers Association [ 55 ] USA Today stated Hyundai proves it's a master of luxury 2008 [ 56 ] Named as Consumer Reports 'Top-Rated Upscale Sedan' (2009) [ 57 ] Ranked No. 1 midsize premium car by JD Power 2009 APEAL study (beating out the BMW 5 Series , Jaguar XF ) [ 58 ] Given 9.5 out of 10 points in 2009 by Edmunds.com, which stated it features a cabin comparable to a top-of-the-line Lexus , but pointed to lack of "brand cachet" as its main drawback [ 59 ] According to Edmunds.com in 2009: "With badges removed, the Genesis could easily pass as a Lexus or Mercedes-Benz, although we doubt many brand-conscious people would give a Hyundai a second glance."
