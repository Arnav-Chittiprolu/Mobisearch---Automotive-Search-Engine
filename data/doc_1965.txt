== Overview ==
The [[concept car]] that precedes its design was called the Volvo Concept 40.2. It was designed by [[Thomas Ingenlath]] alongside the Volvo Concept 40.1, which later became the basis of the XC40. These two concept cars were both unveiled in 2016.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Rabe |first=Mattias |date=2016-05-18 |title=Volvo 40.1 och 40.2 officiella – visar märkets tuffare framtid |url=https://teknikensvarld.expressen.se/nyheter/bil-och-trafik/volvo-40-1-och-40-2-officiella-visar-markets-tuffare-framtid-301505/ |access-date=2025-03-03 |website=Teknikens Värld |language=sv}}</ref> During production, Volvo decided to shift their focus to small crossovers later that year.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Volvo set to become a 'crossover company'|url=https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/volvo-set-become-crossover-company|access-date=19 July 2020|website=Autocar|language=en|archive-date=19 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719081453/https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/industry/volvo-set-become-crossover-company|url-status=live}}</ref> Therefore, Polestar picked the 40.2 as the basis for their Polestar 2 design.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Volvo confirms Polestar 2 electric "sedan"|url=https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1117738_volvo-confirms-polestar-2-electric-sedan|access-date=19 July 2020|website=Green Car Reports|date=17 July 2018 |language=en|archive-date=20 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200720000416/https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1117738_volvo-confirms-polestar-2-electric-sedan|url-status=live}}</ref> Volvo's exterior design chief Maximilian Missoni tweaked the car's taillights, grille, and wheels in order to differentiate it as a standalone vehicle.<ref>{{Cite web|title=6 things you need to know about Polestar|url=https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1122902_6-things-you-need-to-know-about-polestar|access-date=19 July 2020|website=Motor Authority|date=3 May 2019 |language=en|archive-date=19 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200719085035/https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1122902_6-things-you-need-to-know-about-polestar|url-status=live}}</ref> The Polestar 2 is also the first car with Google's [[Android Automotive]] operating system built in.

Polestar 2 is the second car under the Polestar brand after the [[Polestar 1]]. Polestar 1 is, however, a [[plug-in hybrid]] and limited production vehicle, making the Polestar 2 the first [[battery electric vehicle]] and mass production Polestar vehicle.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}

The production version was officially unveiled on 27 February 2019 during an internet livestream and made its first public appearance at the [[Geneva Motor Show#2019|2019 Geneva Motor Show]] that month.<ref>{{cite web |language=en |url=https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2021-polestar-2-ev-geneva-motor-show-408-hp-vegan-interior/ |title=2021 Polestar 2 heads to Geneva Motor Show with 408 hp, vegan interior |last1=Ewing |first1=Steven |publisher=CNET |date=27 February 2019 |access-date=27 February 2019 |archive-date=27 February 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190227223752/https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/2021-polestar-2-ev-geneva-motor-show-408-hp-vegan-interior/ |url-status=live }}</ref> The car had a starting suggested retail price of US$49,900 as of October 2021.<ref>{{cite web |title=Polestar 2 |url=https://www.polestar.com/us/polestar-2/ |publisher=Polestar |access-date=2 October 2021 |archive-date=30 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210930162027/https://www.polestar.com/us/polestar-2/ |url-status=live }}</ref> For the 2022 model year, Polestar announced that additional options would be available for the Polestar 2.<gallery widths="180" heights="120">

===2024 facelift===
[[File:Polestar 2 (Facelift) IMG 9469.jpg|thumb|left|Polestar 2 2024 facelift]]

An updated Polestar 2 was revealed in January 2023 for the 2024 model year, with rear-wheel drive becoming the standard drivetrain for the entry-level model instead of the previous front-wheel drive.  The single motor model was upgraded to produce {{cvt|299|hp|PS kW}} and {{Convert|361|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque, an increase of {{cvt|68|hp|PS kW}} and {{Convert|118|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}, resulting in a 1.1 second faster {{Cvt|0-60|mph|km/h}} time – now 5.9 seconds. The long range trim's battery was also upgraded to a capacity of 82 kWh. The powertrain of the dual-motor model's output was raised by {{cvt|13|hp|PS kW}} and {{Convert|79|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} for a total of {{cvt|421|hp|PS kW}} and {{Convert|546|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}}, enabling a {{Cvt|0-60|mph|km/h}} time of 4.3 seconds. Dual-motor models, now using an [[Induction motor|asynchronous motor]] in the front, will be able to disengage the front axle to increase efficiency and range.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |last=Day |first=Lewin |date=24 January 2023 |title=2024 Polestar 2 Switches from FWD to RWD in a Surprise Move |url=https://www.thedrive.com/news/2024-polestar-2-gets-more-power-more-range-and-rear-wheel-drive |access-date=3 August 2023 |website=The Drive |language=en |archive-date=11 June 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230611013629/https://www.thedrive.com/news/2024-polestar-2-gets-more-power-more-range-and-rear-wheel-drive |url-status=live }}</ref>

The front end also received an update, exchanging its grid-like grille for a more covered version, with an array of sensors and a camera in the center. In addition, the Pilot Pack will come standard for dual-motor models in the North American market.<ref name=":0" />

Technical upgrades include a suspension lowered by {{cvt|25|mm|in}}, specially designed [[Öhlins]] manually adjusted dampers, stiffened springs, bespoke [[Pirelli]] P ZERO tires, and improved performance, with the two electric motors having been tuned to produce a combined output of {{cvt|470|hp|PS kW}}.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.automobile-magazine.fr/voitures-electriques/article/38079-la-polestar-2-fin-prete-a-affronter-la-tesla-model-3-performance|title=La Polestar 2 fin prête à affronter la Tesla Model 3 Performance ?|first=Thomas|last=Kim|date=22 March 2023|website=L'Automobile Magazine|access-date=25 March 2023|archive-date=22 March 2023|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230322222702/https://www.automobile-magazine.fr/voitures-electriques/article/38079-la-polestar-2-fin-prete-a-affronter-la-tesla-model-3-performance|url-status=live}}</ref>

== Recalls ==
In October 2020, Polestar issued a recall on all Polestar 2 models due to a software defect that caused loss of power to the vehicle whilst driving. As the vehicles were not capable of [[Over-the-air programming|OTA]] software updates at that time it required all of the vehicles to be recalled to a service centre for a manual software update.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34276283/polestar-2-ev-recall/|title=All Polestar 2s Recalled for Software Glitch That Can Shut Down the EV|first=Roberto|last=Baldwin|date=29 October 2020|website=Car and Driver|access-date=13 October 2020|archive-date=13 October 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201013172856/https://www.caranddriver.com/news/a34276283/polestar-2-ev-recall/|url-status=live}}</ref>
