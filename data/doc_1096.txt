[ 2 ] It is meant to depict a technologically advanced automobile in the Chicago cityscape from the year 2035. This sports coupé is a visionary interpretation of Audi's typical automobile design . An important challenge presented to the designers was that in order for the car to have successful advertising for Audi as product placement, despite its extreme character, the car still had to be recognised by those audience members familiar with car designs as an Audi. To accommodate this demand, the engineers implemented a current Audi front-end design which includes the trapezoidal "Audi single-frame grille ", the company's trademark four overlapping rings, and the Multi Media Interface (MMI) driver-to-car control system. [ 1 ] The RSQ also includes special features suggested by film director Alex Proyas . The car uses spheres instead of conventional wheels. [ 1 ] Its two reverse butterfly doors are hinged to the C-pillars of the body. [ 1 ] Although this kind of collaboration was a first for Audi, a similar project named the Lexus 2054 was developed by Lexus for use in the 2002 film Minority Report .
