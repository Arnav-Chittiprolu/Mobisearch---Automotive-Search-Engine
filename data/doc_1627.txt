Easytronic is not a tiptronic gearbox design; it does not have a torque converter . It is fundamentally a conventional manual transmission , with a single-plate dry clutch . The transmission is controlled by an electronic control unit (ECU). The Easytronic is generally used in smaller modern front-wheel drive cars, including the Corsa 1.0 & 1.2 & 1.3D , Tigra 1.4 90 ps , Meriva 1.6 & 1.8 , Astra 1.4 & 1.6 , Zafira 1.8 140 ps and Vectra/Signum 1.8 140 ps . The Easytronic transmission is manufactured for Adam Opel AG by ZF Friedrichshafen AG . [ 1 ] The Easytronic system allows for a computer to assume control of the manual gearbox and clutch via electromechanical means. As of Easytronic 3.0, [ 2 ] [ verification needed ] the gearbox can be operated in either fully-automatic or sequential semi-automatic mode. In the former, the car behaves much like a traditional automatic transmission, selecting gears with no driver input; in the latter, the gears can be selected sequentially (using the gear select lever) by the driver. It also offers a traditional automatic-like 'creep' mode [ 3 ] for low-speed maneuvering. Opel's Easytronic is advertised as a low-cost alternative to a traditional automatic transmission for city drivers.
