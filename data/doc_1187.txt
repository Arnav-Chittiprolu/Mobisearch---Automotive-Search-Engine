The '''Hyundai Kona''' ({{langx|ko|현대 코나}}) is a [[subcompact crossover SUV]] produced by the South Korean manufacturer [[Hyundai Motor Company|Hyundai]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Rogers|first=Cameron|date=August 24, 2020|title=Hyundai Kona Prices, Reviews, and Pictures {{!}} Edmunds|url=https://www.edmunds.com/hyundai/kona/|website=[[Edmunds.com]]}}</ref> The first-generation Kona debuted in June 2017 and the production version was revealed later that year. It is positioned between the [[Hyundai Venue|Venue]] or [[Hyundai Bayon|Bayon]] and the [[Hyundai Tucson|Tucson]] in Hyundai crossover SUV line-up. The [[Battery electric vehicle|battery electric]] version called the Kona Electric (or Kona EV) was first launched in [[South Korea]] during the first half of 2018 and rolled out gradually worldwide afterwards.<ref name=":0" />

==Naming==
The Kona is named after the [[Kona District, Hawaii|western district]] of the [[Hawaii (island)|island of Hawaiʻi]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://motoringjunction.com/car-news/hyundai-kona-creta/ |title=2018 Hyundai Kona Unveiled; Smaller Than Creta |date=2017-06-17|work=Motoring Junction|access-date=2017-06-20|language=en-US}}</ref> The company stated the name "reflects the lifestyle of modern customers", in line with its "progressive design" that it adopts.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Panait|first=Mircea|date=2017-04-03|title=2018 Hyundai Kona B-SUV Is Named After A Hawaiian District|url=https://www.autoevolution.com/news/2018-hyundai-kona-b-suv-is-named-after-a-hawaiian-district-116631.html|access-date=2020-12-11|website=autoevolution|language=en}}</ref> The Kona naming also continues Hyundai's tradition of naming crossover SUV models after famous travel destinations, including the Creta, Santa Fe, Tucson and Veracruz.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Hyundai Motor Company Australia {{!}} Hyundai Australia|url=https://www.hyundai.com/au/en/hyundai-info/news/2017/04/hyundai-motor-reveals-kona-as-hawaii-inspired-name-for-new-compact-suv|access-date=2020-12-11|website=www.hyundai.com|language=en}}</ref>

The vehicle is marketed in [[Portugal]] as the '''Hyundai Kauai''', as Kona is too similar to ''cona'', a slang word for the female genitalia in [[European Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Hyundai KAUAI |url=https://www.hyundai.pt/automoveis/kauai/ |website= Hyundai.pt |publisher=Hyundai Portugal|access-date=9 January 2018|language=pt}}</ref><ref name="Carscoops"/> Like Kona, [[Kauai]] is a place in [[Hawaii]].

In [[China]], the vehicle was sold as the '''Hyundai Encino'''.<ref name="Yonhap"/><ref>{{cite news|script-title=zh:2017广州车展：北京现代ENCINO正式亮相 |trans-title=2017 Guangzhou Auto Shot: Beijing Hyundai's Encino revealed |url= http://auto.ifeng.com/guonei/20171117/1100887.shtml |access-date=9 January 2018|work=[[Phoenix Television]]|date=17 November 2017| language = zh-hans|quote={{lang|zh-hans|北京现代旗下全新小型SUV车型——ENCINO(海外版车型为KONA)正式亮相。}} [Beijing Hyundai's new compact SUV -- Encino (overseas version named Kona) is officially unveiled]}}</ref>

The car is sold both in Iceland and Norway under its original name. In Icelandic the word ''kona'' means woman, while in Norwegian ''kona'' is the singular definite form of ''kone'', meaning ''wife''.

===Kona N===
Released at Hyundai N Day on 27 April 2021, the Kona N is Hyundai's first high-performance SUV under the [[Hyundai N]] division. A 2.0-litre turbocharged GDI engine features flat power that maintains maximum output from about 5,500 rpm. The engine is capable of an output up to {{cvt|280|PS|hp kW|0|abbr=on}} and maximum torque is about {{cvt|289|lbft|Nm kgm|abbr=on|sigfig=3}}. The output can temporarily reach up to {{cvt|290|PS|hp kW|0|abbr=on}} when in the N Grin Shift mode.

In the front, an N logo and a dark chrome-colour Hyundai logo are attached to the grille. At the sides and rear, a front lip spoiler, double-wing rear spoiler and side sill mouldings offer added downforce, improving grip force and high-speed stability. It also features an N-exclusive triangular third brake light. Inside, the seats, steering wheel, gear knob and hand brake are tinted with Performance Blue while faux suede seats come with side bolsters. An N-dedicated colour Sonic Blue was added and N Grin Shift, N Power Shift, N Track Sense Shift and Variable Exhaust Valve System come as standard.

The second-generation Kona was revealed in December 2022.

According to Hyundai, the second-generation Kona was first designed as a battery electric vehicle before being adapted for other variants. Compared to the previous generation, the vehicle has a significantly larger footprint with around {{cvt|150|mm|in|1}} additional length (depending on the variant) and a {{cvt|60|mm|in|1}} longer wheelbase.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-12-20 |title=2023 Hyundai Kona revealed - SUV designed as an EV first; larger; also available with ICE and hybrid power |url=https://paultan.org/2022/12/20/2023-hyundai-kona-revealed/ |access-date=2023-09-26 |website=Paul Tan's Automotive News |language=en-US}}</ref> As the result, the rear legroom is {{cvt|31|mm|in|1}} larger at {{cvt|925|mm|in|1}}.

=== Kona Electric ===
The second-generation Kona Electric is available since launch. The variant is distinguished with pixelated front and rear thin light bars and blocked front grille, while a Parametric Pixel design feature has been applied to the front and bottom of the rear bumper.<ref name=":2" />

The Kona Electric is built with a 400 V electrical architecture, which impairs its DC fast charging times comparing to other Hyundai EVs built on the more recent 800 V architecture. Hyundai claims a 10-80% state of charge can be accomplished in 41 minutes, against the 18 minutes it claims for some of their 800V models.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.hyundai.com/worldwide/en/eco/ioniq5/charging | title=IONIQ 5 Charging &#124; Eco - Hyundai Worldwide }}</ref> It also includes vehicle-to-load (V2L) support, with different maximum outputs depending on the market.

Two battery capacities are offered, which are 48.4 kWh (Standard Range) and 65.4 kWh (Long Range) powering a front-mounted electric motor.<ref name=":2" />

The Kona Electric N-Line was revealed on 17 January 2024.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Chilton |first=Chris |date=2024-01-17 |title=Hyundai Kona Electric N Line Has N Looks But NNNo Extra Power |url=https://www.carscoops.com/2024/01/hyundai-kona-electric-n-line-has-n-looks-but-nnno-extra-power/ |access-date=2024-01-19 |website=Carscoops}}</ref><gallery widths="200" heights="110">
