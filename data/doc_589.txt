The architecture debuted in 2002 with the Saturn Vue and was later used for the Chevrolet Equinox and Captiva and similar models. Development [ edit ] The Theta uses a four-wheel independent suspension . Engine choices include the Family II straight-4 , Ecotec straight-4 , 3400 V6 , and even a Honda V6, the L66 . A 5-speed automatic and two 5-speed manual transmissions are used. The original Saturn Vue used a short 106.6 in (2708 mm) wheelbase, with a 61 in (1549 mm) track. The Chevrolet Equinox and Pontiac Torrent use a stretched 112.5 in (2857 mm) wheelbase, but share much with the Saturn. The Suzuki Grand Vitara , although similar in size and appearance to a Saturn Vue, was developed by Suzuki using some Theta components, but should not be considered a Theta derivative. Engineering for the Opel Antara and Chevrolet Captiva was performed in large part in Korea by GM Daewoo Auto & Technology , and by Opel in Germany. Hybrids [ edit ] The Saturn Vue was one of the first of General Motors ' vehicles to be offered with a hybrid powertrain, GM's belt alternator starter (BAS) system, in 2006.
