[ 3 ] History [ edit ] Orient Overseas [ edit ] Founder of Orient Overseas, Tung Chao-yung , operated the first all-Chinese crewed ship between Hong Kong and Europe and the east coast of the United States [ 4 ] in 1947. [ 5 ] However, Tung Chao-yung already established his Hong Kong operation in 1937. [ 6 ] He was the vice-president of Shipowners Association in Tianjin at that time. [ 6 ] Tung Chao-yung then [ when? ] named the company Orient Overseas Line. [ 4 ] In 1969, the business was renamed as Orient Overseas Container Line . [ 4 ] [ non-primary source needed ] The holding company of the group, Orient Overseas Container (Holdings) Limited, was incorporated on 27 February 1973. [ 7 ] It was a listed company in Hong Kong , Far East [ zh ] and Kam Ngan stock exchanges since May 1973. [ 8 ] These exchanges were merged in 1986. Jardine Matheson was a minority shareholder of the listed company. [ 6 ] In 1973, Orient Overseas Line purchased the passenger liner President Cleveland and renamed it Oriental President . [ 9 ] Also in 1973, Orient Overseas commissioned the building of Wall Street Plaza (88 Pine Street), an office building in New York, as well as a nearby plaza.  The building was built by I. M. Pei's company and designed by architect Jim Freed . [ 10 ] In 1974, Orient Overseas Container (Holdings) acquired a bulk freighter company from the Tung family's C.Y. Tung Group, for HK$43 million. [ 11 ] In 1976, the listed company acquired additional assets from the Tung family, including two container ships and 33% shares of another container shipping company, Dart Container Service . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] In 1980, Orient Overseas Container (Holdings) acquired a British shipping company, Furness, Withy & Co. [ 14 ] Shortly before the death of Tung Chao-yung in 1982, [ 14 ] Tung Chee-hwa , his eldest son, succeeded to be the chairman of Orient Overseas. [ 13 ] In 1983, Orient Overseas Container (Holdings) Limited, was renamed to Orient Overseas (Holdings) Limited. [ 7 ] In February 1986, Orient Overseas (Holdings) Limited submitted a plan to the creditors for re-structuring the group of companies, including the formation of a new business unit centered on Orient Overseas Container Line Limited. [ 15 ] In October, Crédit Commercial de France cancelled the application to the court on liquidate Orient Overseas. [ 16 ] Orient Overseas was suspended in the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) due to its financial problem, which the suspension was lifted in February 1987. [ 17 ] In the same year, Orient Overseas announced to consider to close down the oil drilling business unit. [ 18 ] In November, the group announced to sell some subsidiaries of group, such as Kuwait Hong Kong General Insurance and others companies. [ 19 ] The insurance and oil drilling businesses were acquired by China Merchants Group . [ 20 ] In May 1988, Orient Overseas acquired additional stakes in the Terminal No. 2, 4 and 6 of Kwai Tsing Container Terminals from Hongkong International Terminals Limited. [ 21 ] Orient Overseas (International) Limited [ edit ] Orient Overseas (International) Limited (OOIL), was incorporated in Bermuda on 29 July 1986. [ 22 ] Some time later, it became the new holding company of the group. OOIL became a listed company on 31 July 1992. [ 23 ] OOIL's predecessor, Orient Overseas (Holdings) Limited (OOHL), ceased to become a listed company in the same year. Each OOHL's share is offered 1.08431411 shares of OOIL in exchange. [ 24 ] Orient Overseas (Holdings) was deregistered and dissolved in 2005. [ 25 ] The listed company also sold the stake in Furness Withy and the Kwai Tsing Container Terminals during its restructuring. [ 26 ] The company paid dividend again in 1994, the first time since the restructuring. [ 26 ] In 1996, Tung Chee-chen , Tung Chao-yung's younger son and Tung Chee-wah's younger brother, took over the chairman position of OOIL, since Tung Chee-wah's election as Chief Executive of Hong Kong . [ 4 ] In 2006, Orient Overseas sold four container terminals to the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan . [ 27 ] In July 2017, OOIL received a US$6.3 billion take over bid from its Chinese rival, COSCO Shipping . The bid has been accepted by the Tung family, subject to shareholder and regulatory approval. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The takeover was completed in 2018. [ 4 ] In April 2019, OOIL sold a container terminal in Long Beach to Macquarie Group for US$1.78 billion. [ 30 ] In May 2019, Orient Overseas Associates (the holding company in the US) backed out of a deal to lease office space at Wall Street Plaza in New York to Amnesty International .  This raised speculation that interference from mainland China-headquartered COSCO Shipping was involved, as denying leases is out-of-character for building owners.
