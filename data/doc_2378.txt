It was launched in 2017 by crown prince Mohammad bin Salman , who was the driving force and hands-on chair behind the project. [ 2 ] The site is at the northern tip of the Red Sea , due east of Egypt across the Gulf of Aqaba and south of Jordan . The total planned area of Neom is 26,500 km 2 (10,200 sq mi). Multiple regions are planned, including a floating industrial complex, global trade hub, tourist resorts, and a linear city powered by renewable energy sources. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Thousands of people have been forcibly moved to make way for the project and villages have been razed. [ 5 ] Much of the city is expected to be completed by 2030, as it is one of the focal points of Saudi Vision 2030 . [ 6 ] Some experts have expressed skepticism about the ambitions of the megaproject . [ 7 ] Initially estimated to cost $1.6 trillion, [ 2 ] the project's estimated costs were eventually in excess of $8.8 trillion (more than 25 times the annual Saudi budget). [ 8 ] On 29 January 2019, the Saudi government announced that it had established a closed joint-stock company named Neom. [ 9 ] The company, which is solely dedicated to developing the economic zone of Neom, is wholly owned by the Public Investment Fund , the Saudi government's sovereign wealth fund . [ 10 ] Saudi Arabia originally aimed to complete major parts of the project by 2020, with an expansion completed in 2025, but fell behind schedule. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] By July 2022, only two buildings had been constructed, and most of the project area remained bare desert. [ 12 ] In 2024, an opening party was held for Sindalah , three years after schedule and at three times its initial cost. [ 8 ] As of July 2025, Sindalah remains closed to the public. [ 13 ] In 2024, Neom was reported to have been substantially scaled back from its original plan; however, this was denied by the Saudi Economic Minister, Faisal F. Alibrahim . [ 8 ] [ 14 ] An internal audit of the megaproject found extensive problems, including "evidence of deliberate manipulation", by the managers of the project. [ 8 ] By 2025, new contracts for Neom dried up and there was no mention of Neom in Saudi Arabia's pre-budget statement for 2026. [ 15 ] Neom's construction has also been criticised for environmental and human rights violations, with expatriate employees describing abusive working conditions and members of the local Howeitat tribe protesting against their forced expulsion. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Around 20,000 people are expected to be forcibly relocated. [ 18 ] Members of the Howeitat tribe have been killed resisting evictions, including Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti who was killed by Saudi security forces under disputed circumstances. [ 19 ] Three other members of the tribe were also sentenced to death for resisting evictions. [ 20 ] Etymology [ edit ] Neom means "new future". [ 21 ] The first three letters are the Greek prefix neo meaning "new", and the fourth letter, M, represents the Arabic word for "future" ( Arabic : مستقبل , romanized : Mustaqbal , Hejazi Arabic pronunciation: [mʊsˈtaɡbal] ). [ 22 ] History [ edit ] Salman announced plans for the planned city at the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh on October 24, 2017. [ 23 ] He said that it would operate independently from the "existing governmental framework" with its own tax and labour laws and an "autonomous judicial system". [ 24 ] Egypt announced in 2018 that it would contribute some land to the Neom project. [ 25 ] Klaus Kleinfeld was announced by Salman as the inaugural director for the Neom project upon its launch. [ 26 ] In 2018, Kleinfeld signed Gladstone Place Partners LLC to handle communications services for the Neom project for a fee of $199,500 plus expenses of $45,000. [ 27 ] [ full citation needed ] [ 28 ] Kleinfeld was then announced as an advisor to bin Salman and Nadhmi Al-Nasr as the director of Neom. [ 26 ] The initiative to create the city of Neom emerged from Saudi Vision 2030 , a plan to reduce Saudi Arabia's dependence on oil, diversify its economy, and develop public-service sectors . [ 29 ] Plans call for robots to perform functions such as security, logistics , home delivery, and caregiving [ 30 ] and for the city to be powered solely with wind and solar power. [ 24 ] Failures [ edit ] In 2023, Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman said of the critics of the project, "They say in a lot of projects that happen in Saudi Arabia, it can't be done, this is very ambitious. They can keep saying that. And we can keep proving them wrong." [ 2 ] In 2025, the Wall Street Journal reported on an internal audit of the megaproject which found extensive problems, including "evidence of deliberate manipulation", by the managers of the project. [ 8 ] By 2025, new contracts for Neom dried up and there was no mention of Neom in Saudi Arabia's pre-budget statement for 2026. [ 15 ] In October 2024, an opening party for Sindalah , a luxury island destination, was held, the first for Neom region. [ 31 ] Despite the opening party, the Wall Street Journal reported that as of March 2025, Sindalah remains closed to the public [ 8 ] and its fate is uncertain. [ 32 ] A few weeks after the opening party, Neom CEO Al-Nasr was removed from his position and replaced by Aimen Al-Mudaifer , head of the Local Real Estate division at Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund . [ 1 ] Former Neom employees likened the working culture to Hans Christian Andersen ’s fairy tale The Emperor’s New Clothes , as dissent was ignored or punished. [ 2 ] Bin Salman, the project's hands-on chair, proposed increasingly bold ideas for the project that staff had concerns about.

[ edit ] The Line ( Arabic : ذا لاين ) is a planned smart city in Neom, Tabuk Province, Saudi Arabia , to be housed in a single very long building—a linear settlement —that is designed to have no cars , streets or carbon emissions . [ 50 ] [ 51 ] The project was thought up by Saudi ruler Mohammed bin Salman , who was the hands-on chair of the project. [ 52 ] The initial plan was for the city to span 170 kilometres (110 mi) at a height of 500 m (1,600 ft) [ 53 ] and a width of 200 metres (660 ft), sized to accommodate a population of 9 million, 25% of Saudi Arabia's 2022 population of 35.5 million. [ 54 ] The Line was planned to have an entirely glass mirror exterior, [ 54 ] with all basic services within a five-minute walking distance. [ 55 ] [ 56 ] The city is one of the five announced regions of Neom and is a part of Saudi Vision 2030 project. [ 50 ] Neom Bay [ edit ] Coast and islands, Neom peninsula (middle) The development work of the project's first phase, Neom Bay, was planned to start in the first quarter of 2019 with completion by 2020. [ 57 ] [ needs update ] The developments were to include constructing the airport at Sharma, which would operate regular commercial flights between Riyadh and Neom. [ 58 ] The plan of Neom Bay's developments also involves building the first residential area in Neom as part of Phase 1. [ 59 ] Neom Bay Airport [ edit ] In June 2019, it was announced that the Neom Bay Airport would begin commercial flight traffic after the first phase of the airport was completed with a runway length of 3,757 m (12,326 ft). [ 60 ] [ 61 ] [ 62 ] The first commercial flight was by Saudia from Riyadh. [ 63 ] The planned airport has been registered by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) with the code NUM. [ 61 ] Oxagon [ edit ] Oxagon (originally named Neom Industrial City) was announced as a floating industrial complex in the shape of an octagon. According to the announcement, it will be located around 25 kilometres (16 mi) north of the town of Duba , and cover roughly 200–250 square kilometres (77–97 mi 2 ) of land, of which approximately 40 square kilometres (15 mi 2 ) will form the city. [ 64 ] Oxagon is designed to focus on manufacturing, industrial research and development, incorporating the former Duba port, which has been renamed the "port of Neom". [ 65 ] [ 66 ] The plans for the complex include a desalination plant , a hydrogen plant , and an oceanographic research center. [ 67 ] [ 68 ] It will also be home to the cognitive multinational company Tonomus (originally NEOM Tech & Digital Company), which is the first subsidiary company to evolve from NEOM. [ 69 ] [ 70 ] [ 71 ] On 16 December 2022, Saudi Arabia's Ministry of Industry and Mineral Resources , the Saudi Authority for Industrial Cities and Technology Zones and Neom signed a memorandum of understanding to facilitate collaboration and legislation in support of Neom's Future Factories Program. [ 72 ] Trojena [ edit ] Main article: Trojena On 3 March 2022, the Trojena project was launched, which will potentially be the first major outdoor skiing destination in the Arabian Peninsula . The project's site is about 50 kilometres (31 mi) from the Gulf of Aqaba coast in the Sarat Mountains , with elevations ranging from 1,500–2,600 metres (4,900–8,500 ft). Although it is in the desert, the site's climate is considerably cooler than is the rest of Neom's territory. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] Ennismore, a lifestyle and hospitality company, was announced as the inaugural partner with its brands 25hours Hotels and Morgans Originals. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] In September 2023, Zaha Hadid Architects designed a 330 m (1,080 ft) tall skyscraper for Trojena which will stand on a mountain overlooking an artificial lake. Renders of the skyscraper, which will be connected to the lakeside development by a cable car, showed a crystalline structure made of numerous columns that narrow towards the peak. [ 81 ] Sindalah [ edit ] Main article: Sindalah In December 2022, Neom announced plans for Sindalah, an 1,100,000-cubic-yard luxury resort complex off the city coast. [ 82 ] It is planned to have an 86-berth marina and three luxury hotels, and it could accommodate as many as 2,400 visitors daily. [ 83 ] [ 82 ] A nine-hole golf course overlooking the sea was constructed in 2023. In October 2024, Sindalah held a grand opening party, but had not yet open to visitors as of March 2025. [ 8 ] Aquellum [ edit ] In January 2024, Neom announced Aquellum, a "subterranean digitalized community of the future" that would "invert architectural principles to integrate with nature". Described as an "upside-down skyscraper", it is planned to be dug into a 450 m-high (1,480 ft) mountain, with access from an underwater square. [ 84 ] Leyja [ edit ] Leyja is a planned tourist destination which is designed to support the Saudi Vision 2030 plan for a sustainable tourism industry. According to the Saudi Press Agency , 95 per cent of Leyja's land area will be preserved for natural space. [ 85 ] Leyja includes three Hotels which are the Adventure Hotel, designed by Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA), Oasis Hotel, designed by Mario Cucinella Architects (MCA), and the Wellness Hotel, designed by Killa Design . The hotels will provide 120 boutique rooms and suites. [ 86 ] Agriculture [ edit ] Neom plans for 6,500 hectares (16,000 acres) of the surrounding land to become agricultural fields and to rely heavily on genetically engineered crops . [ 87 ] [ 88 ] Utilities [ edit ] A subsidiary, ENOWA , has been founded to provide renewable energy, green hydrogen, and zero waste desalination. [ 89 ] [ 90 ] International relations [ edit ] In March 2020, Neom signed a partnership deal as a principal partner with Mercedes-EQ Formula E Team . [ 91 ] In June 2022, Neom became the title sponsor of McLaren Racing 's electric motorsport division as NEOM McLaren Electric Racing from the 2022–23 season, with McLaren's Formula E and Extreme E divisions renamed as NEOM McLaren Formula E Team and NEOM McLaren Extreme E Team , respectively. [ 92 ] Following McLaren's exit from Formula E and Extreme E, Neom continued their partnership by sponsoring McLaren's second F1 Academy entrant as McLaren Oxagon for the 2026 season . [ 93 ] [ 94 ] In July 2020, the American company Air Products & Chemicals announced that it would build the world's largest green hydrogen plant in Saudi Arabia. The company will jointly own the US$5 billion project with Saudi Arabia's ACWA Power and Neom. [ 95 ] In March 2021, Neom signed a four-year global sponsorship agreement with the Asian Football Confederation . [ 96 ] In 2022, Neom hosted Extreme E's 2022 Desert X-Prix and held the naming rights to the series' Island X-Prix in Sardinia . [ 97 ] [ 98 ] In May 2022, Indian conglomerate Larsen & Toubro was awarded the contract for construction of a 2,930-megawatt solar power generation plant, a 1,370-megawatt wind-power farm, a 400-megawatt battery energy storage system, and a power transmission network of about 190 km. [ 99 ] In October 2022, Trojena was announced as the future host of the 2029 Asian Winter Games . [ 100 ] After opening its first international office in London in November 2023, Neom opened its second one in New York in February 2024. [ 101 ] Suggestion of Israeli cooperation [ edit ] This section needs additional citations for verification . Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources in this section. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. ( November 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) See also: Arab–Israeli normalization Despite historically antagonistic relations, Israel is speculated to play a significant role in the development of NEOM, with some suggesting that Saudi Arabia may be expressing an interest in Israeli intellectual capabilities for this purpose. It is also suggested that Israel has reciprocated this interest. In line with this, Saudi Arabia is reported to hope to establish an economic partnership with Israel to promote the economic development of NEOM. In particular, analysts suggest that Saudi Arabia may be interested in enhancing economic relations with high-tech industries in Israel , which are essential for the technological vision of NEOM. According to a report in an Israeli newspaper [ which? ] , there is purportedly evidence of coordination between Arab businessmen and diplomats in Tel Aviv , with companies in Israel said to be prepared to secure contracts worth billions of dollars. The Saudi Arabian government is also reportedly involved in such communications. Consequently, analysts have proposed that NEOM could serve as a potential impetus for normalisation between Saudi Arabia and Israel. [ 102 ] [ 103 ] Controversies [ edit ] High mortality rates [ edit ] See also: Human trafficking in Saudi Arabia Researchers documented alarmingly high mortality rates among migrant workers from India, Bangladesh, and Nepal employed on Saudi construction projects, including Neom. Government sources show that 70–80% of worker deaths are officially classified as "natural causes", but investigations reveal many workers actually collapsed at their workplaces before dying. [ 104 ] A 2024 ITV documentary reported approximately 21,000 foreign worker deaths since construction began in 2017, with an additional 100,000 workers reported missing. [ 105 ] [ 106 ] This information pertains to the construction projects of "Saudi Vision 2030", which includes NEOM. [ 107 ] Workers report extreme conditions including 16-hour workdays for 14 consecutive days in temperatures reaching 50°C. Many describe feeling like "trapped slaves", with some required to pay fines equivalent to five months' salary to leave their positions. [ 104 ] Researchers collected information about migrant workers' deaths from Indian, Bangladeshi, and Nepali government sources. Across nationalities the large majority of deaths of workers were attributed to "natural causes", which accounted for 74 percent of 1,420 Indian migrant worker deaths recorded just at the Indian embassy in Riyadh in 2023; 80 percent of 887 Bangladeshi deaths during the first 6 months of 2024, and 68 percent of 870 Nepali migrant worker deaths from 2019 to 2022. At least 13,685 Bangladeshis died in Saudi Arabia between 2008 and 2022, according to records kept by the Bangladeshi government. More than 1,500 Bangladeshis died in 2022 alone, a rate of more than four a day. [ 108 ] Approximately 20 percent of Neom workers are from Bangladesh. Five of the nine cases Human Rights Watch documented of deaths that official documents classify as nonwork related, including by "natural causes", involved workers who collapsed at their workplace and later died, their families said. [ 104 ] [ 106 ] [ 109 ] [ 110 ] Abusive work culture [ edit ] See also: Kafala system In 2022, former employees reported NEOM project CEO Nadhmi Al-Nasr for promoting a management culture that "belittled expatriates , made unrealistic demands, and neglected discrimination in the workplace". [ 22 ] [ 111 ] The resignation letter of a former chief executive, Andrew Wirth , accused Nasr's leadership of being "consistently inclusive of disparagement and inappropriately dismissive and demeaning outbursts". [ 111 ] Nasr, appointed by Prince Mohammed with the responsibility to lead NEOM, was accused in his tenure of berating and scaring his employees, as confirmed by present and former staff members. [ 112 ] Two gigaprojects under the Saudi Vision 2030 were merged in 2022, while the remaining three projects lost their expatriate chief executives and turned over the senior management. [ 111 ] The Saudi government refused to comment, while Neom declined to make Nasr available for answers or interview requests. However, Neom issued a written statement in defense of Nasr and the management culture at the megaproject, asserting that Neom represented "a scale and ambition the world has never seen before" and that it continued to retain and attract more talent because "employees are passionate about what they do and deeply committed to living up to, and delivering on, the Neom vision". [ 113 ] Anthony Harris, a former director of innovation at Neom's education team, accused the crown prince Mohammed bin Salman of fostering a faulty workplace culture since "Nadhmi takes his cue from his boss, and everyone else at Neom takes their cue from Nadhmi." [ 111 ] At one company meeting, Nasr said on record, "I drive everybody like a slave, when they drop down dead, I celebrate. That's how I do my projects." [ 111 ] He also threatened to replace employees stuck in other countries during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in 2020, which included the former director of branding and marketing. [ 111 ] In late 2018, Neom's progress suffered after the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi . [ 114 ] Advisers to Neom, including Daniel L. Doctoroff [ 115 ] and architect Norman Foster , were reported to have distanced themselves from the project and the "toxic" Saudi crown prince. [ 116 ] Evictions and executions [ edit ] It is estimated that 20,000 people will be forced to relocate to accommodate the planned city. [ 18 ] The Howeitat tribe, who are native to the area, have said that they do not oppose the city but would rather not face forced expulsion and violence. [ 19 ] On 13 April 2020, activist Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti posted videos online announcing that Saudi security forces were trying to evict him and other members of the Howeitat tribe from their historical homeland to make way for the development of Neom. [ 22 ] [ 19 ] In the videos, Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti said that he would defy the eviction orders, although he expected that Saudi authorities would plant weapons in his house to incriminate him. [ 117 ] He was later shot and killed by Saudi security forces, who claimed he had opened fire on them. [ 117 ] London-based human rights activist and fellow Howeitat tribe member Alya Alhwaiti disputed this version of events, stating that al-Huwaiti did not own firearms. [ 19 ] al-Huwaiti's funeral was held near the village of al-Khoraibah and was well attended despite the presence of Saudi security forces. [ 19 ] Eight cousins of al-Huwaiti have been arrested for protesting against the eviction order, but Alhwaiti has said that she and other human rights activists hoped to challenge the arrests. [ 19 ] In June 2020, Salman signed a $1.7 million contract with American public-relations and lobbying firm Ruder Finn to counter the criticism and controversies involving the Neom city project. [ 118 ] In November 2020, British lawyers representing the Howeitat tribe urged Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab to boycott the G20 Summit in Saudi Arabia , arguing that the United Kingdom has a moral imperative to take a stand in defense of the tribe and confront Saudi Arabia over its human-rights issues. [ 119 ] In October 2022, the Specialized Criminal Court of Saudi Arabia sentenced three members of the Howeitat tribe to death for resisting displacement. [ 20 ] The three men were arrested in 2020 for opposing the eviction of their tribe for the project. One of the condemned men, Shadli al-Howeiti, was the brother of Abdul Rahim al-Huwaiti . [ 120 ] In May 2024, a former intelligence officer for Saudi Arabia named Col. Rabih Alenezi claimed that Saudi authorities have permitted the use of lethal force to clear land for Neom and he was ordered to shoot a villager for refusing to be evicted. [ 121 ] Surveillance [ edit ] Designers of The Line announced plans to use data as a currency to manage and provide facilities such as power, waste, water, healthcare, transport and security. [ 122 ] [ 123 ] It was said that data would also be collected from the smartphones of the residents, their homes, facial recognition cameras and multiple other sensors. According to Joseph Bradley, the chief executive of Neom Tech & Digital Co., the data sweep would help developers feed the collected information to the city for further predicting and customizing every user's needs. [ 122 ] However, Saudi Arabia's poor human rights record [ 124 ] and use of espionage [ 125 ] and surveillance technology for spying on its citizens [ 126 ] emerged as a roadblock, according to digital rights experts. Vincent Mosco, a researcher into the social effects of technology, stated that "the surveillance concerns are justified" while further adding that "it is, in effect, a surveillance city". [ 122 ] The Saudi Ministry of Communications and Information Technology did not respond to digital rights experts and researchers' requests for comments. [ 122 ] Viability and concept [ edit ] The project has been critiqued as a "laboratory of false solutions" inasmuch as carbon capture and storage (CCS), green hydrogen , and carbon-offsetting are self-serving panaceas backed by the fossil fuel industry which do not work at scale. [ 127 ] In October 2022, Neom was announced as the host of the 2029 Asian Winter Games , a decision that received criticism concerning its adverse environmental impact. [ 100 ] Amidst increasing global-warming concerns, the project drew multiple points of concern, including the expected high temperatures in the desert land, the energy impact, and detour of local water resources to the construction of artificial ski slopes from scratch. Raphael Le Magoariec, a political scientist and specialist in the geopolitics of sports in the Persian Gulf region said that Riyadh "mainly wants to promote its city of the future". [ 100 ] International Ski and Snowboard Federation secretary general Michel Vion expressed surprise at the decision of the Olympic Council of Asia and Olympic downhill silver medalist Johan Clarey said, "it is awful for our sport." [ 100 ] Furthermore Salman's vision for the city includes such fanciful technologies as flying cars , robot maids , dinosaur robots, and even a giant artificial moon. [ 128 ] Former managers and executives involved in the Neom megaproject have said that the project's projections are completely unrealistic and that some of them refused to sign off on plans. Dissenters and skeptics have been removed from Neom-related projects. [ 8 ] Internal audit [ edit ] In March 2025, the Wall Street Journal reported on an internal audit of the Neom megaproject wherein it was found that executives, aided by McKinsey & Company , had relied on unrealistically rosy assumptions to justify cost overruns. [ 8 ] The audit found "evidence of deliberate manipulation" of finances by "certain members of management". [ 8 ] McKinsey's fees have reached $130 million in a single year.
