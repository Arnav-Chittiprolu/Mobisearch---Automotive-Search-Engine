An SUV formerly called the "Audi e-tron", with a 328-kilometer (204-mile) EPA range and a 95-kWh battery, entered production in 2018 [ 4 ] [ 5 ] and was first delivered in 2019. The vehicle is sold in many countries, including the US, Canada and multiple countries in Europe. At the end of September 2019, there were more than 10,000 e-trons registered worldwide. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Audi announced that the facelifted e-tron will be renamed, and will be sold as the Audi Q8 e-tron ; it was revealed on November 9, 2022. [ 9 ] Q2L e-tron (2019) [ edit ] Audi Q2L e-tron is based on the gasoline-powered vehicle Audi Q2 , which is based the MQB platform. The Q2L e-tron is an all-electric version of the long-wheelbase variant of the subcompact SUV Audi Q2 , which went into production at the Foshan plant in November 2019 and is sold exclusively in China. Powered by a 38 kWh lithium-ion battery of Chinese supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology , the Q2L e-tron has a range of 265 kilometres (165 mi) on one charge and a top speed of 150 km/h (93 mph). Its electric motor delivers the maximum power of 100 kW (134 hp) and maximum torque of 290 N⋅m (214 lbf⋅ft). [ 10 ] Q8 e-tron Sportback (2020) [ edit ] Main article: Audi Q8 e-tron § Sportback version Audi Q8 e-tron Sportback is based on the MLB platform. The e-tron Sportback is an all-electric coupé SUV shown first as a concept at the 2017 Shanghai Motor Show. It has the same powertrain/battery as the e-tron SUV . Both cars are produced in Brussels, Belgium. [ 11 ] As in the e-tron SUV, the battery of the vehicle is liquid-cooled. [ 12 ] The production version was revealed at the 2019 Los Angeles Auto Show . European and American deliveries started in 2020. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] The 2020 e-tron Sportback has an EPA range of 351 kilometres (218 mi). [ 15 ] It is better than in the 2019 e-tron SUV, partially because a larger percentage of the battery capacity is usable. The e-tron's battery management system keeps part of the battery capacity as a buffer, which is not part of the usable capacity; now the size of that buffer was decreased to unlock more usable capacity. This change was introduced in the e-tron SUV during the production run, while in the e-tron Sportback, which entered production later, it was available from the beginning. In 2022, it was announced that the vehicle will be renamed. It is now known as the Audi Q8 e-tron Sportback. e-tron GT (2021) [ edit ] Main article: Audi e-tron GT Audi RS e-tron GT The e-tron GT is a four-door all-electric grand tourer .

[ 39 ] [ 40 ] Concept vehicles [ edit ] e-tron Frankfurt (2009) [ edit ] See also: Audi R8 e-tron Audi e-tron (Frankfurt) The first e-tron concept car was shown at the 2009 International Motor Show Germany . A two-seater, similar in appearance to the Audi R8 but slightly smaller, is powered by four UQM Technologies motors, [ 41 ] providing four-wheel drive . Together, these produce 230 kW (310 PS; 310 hp) and 4,500 N⋅m (3,300 lb⋅ft) of torque, allowing the car to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h (62 mph) in 4.8 seconds. A 470 kg (1,036 lb) 42.4 kWh lithium-ion battery is located in front of the rear axle and provides a range of approximately 248 km (154 mi) [ 42 ] with a full charge taking 6–8 hours from a normal household socket.
