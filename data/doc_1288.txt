From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Apple CarPlay ) Protocol for connecting Apple hardware to car radios CarPlay Wireless CarPlay displaying music in a Nissan Altima Original author Apple Developer Apple Initial release March 10, 2014 ; 11 years ago ( 2014-03-10 ) Stable release iOS 18.5
   / May 12, 2025 ; 7 months ago ( 2025-05-12 ) Operating system iOS Platform iPhone Available in Same language as the connected iPhone Type Telematics Website apple .com /ios /carplay / CarPlay is an Apple standard that enables a car radio or automotive head unit to be a display and controller for an iOS device. It is available on iPhone 5 and later models running iOS 7 .1 or later. More than 800 car and motorcycle models support CarPlay, according to Apple. [ 1 ] Vehicle owners can add support by installing certain aftermarket vehicle audio products. [ 2 ] Most CarPlay systems connect to iOS through USB , [ 2 ] some are wireless, [ 3 ] and wireless support can be added through aftermarket dongles. [ 4 ] CarPlay Ultra, a more integrated version of CarPlay, was first announced on Aston Martin DBX707 in May 2025. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Software [ edit ] Apple's CarPlay-enabled apps include: Phone Apple Music Apple Maps Calendar Messages Audiobooks (part of Apple Books ) Podcasts Settings News Developers must obtain permission [ 7 ] from Apple to develop CarPlay-enabled apps. [ 8 ] Such apps fall into five categories: Audio: primarily provide audio content, such as music or podcasts. Examples: Amazon Music , Audible , Google Play Music , iHeartRadio , QQ Music , Spotify , and Overcast . Navigation: turn-by-turn guidance, including searching for points of interests and navigating to a destination. Examples: AutoNavi , Baidu Maps , Google Maps , ChargeFinder and Waze . Automaker-made apps allow a user to control vehicle-specific features such as climate controls, gas levels, or radio via CarPlay. Messaging/ Voice over IP (VoIP) : listen to new messages and reply using dictation in an audio-only interface. Messaging apps on CarPlay integrate with third-party Siri support (known as SiriKit), while VoIP apps integrate with the iOS calling interface using CallKit. Examples: Telegram , WhatsApp , and Zoom . Food-ordering and parking-services apps. [ 9 ] To discourage distracted driving , Siri is used extensively, providing voice turn-by-turn navigation guidance and voice-input for text messages. Newscast-style weather and stock results are announced instead of displayed. [ 10 ] Requests that bring up visual information may be blocked when the car is in gear, and most native CarPlay apps deliver audio content with minimal interaction. CarPlay-enabled apps installed on the device appear on the CarPlay home screen unless disabled by the user. The inclusion or exclusion and order of app appearance can be changed on a per-vehicle basis. Hardware [ edit ] Most of the CarPlay software runs on the connected iPhone. The CarPlay interface provides audio output and a visual display to the vehicle’s infotainment system, while adapting to the vehicle’s available control methods, including touch screens, rotary dials, physical buttons, steering-wheel controls, and hands-free microphones.
Aftermarket head units may support CarPlay or Android Auto , and many support both platforms. [ 2 ] [ 11 ] Wired CarPlay [ edit ] In a wired CarPlay configuration, the iPhone connects to the vehicle or head unit via a USB cable. The USB connection supplies power to the iPhone and provides a stable data link for audio, video, and control input. Wired CarPlay is supported by a wide range of factory-installed infotainment systems and aftermarket head units.
Some third-party devices marketed as wireless CarPlay adapters operate by emulating a wired CarPlay connection to the vehicle. These devices plug into the vehicle’s USB port and present themselves as a wired CarPlay interface, while separately establishing a wireless connection to the iPhone. Such devices still require the vehicle or head unit to support standard (wired) CarPlay. [ 12 ] Wireless CarPlay [ edit ] Wireless CarPlay allows the iPhone to connect to a compatible vehicle or head unit without a physical cable. During the initial pairing process, the iPhone exchanges network credentials with the CarPlay receiver over Bluetooth. Once paired, CarPlay data is transmitted over a two-way Wi-Fi connection between the phone and the vehicle.
Wireless CarPlay support depends on both the vehicle or head unit hardware and the iPhone model, and is generally limited to newer factory systems and select aftermarket receivers. History [ edit ] Predecessor [ edit ] In 2008, one year after the release of the iPhone , Mercedes vehicles were first to sell an audio system incorporating both the iPod and iPhone, equipped with 30-pin iOS input jacks. The new 2008 Harman Kardon NTG 2.5 featured full audio streaming, syncing, charging and control integrated into the steering wheel controls, instrument panel, and head unit. Apple was working with Mercedes to develop iOS compatible audio systems into their cars first only a year after iPhone launch. With an Apple Lightning-to-30-pin adapter, iPhones/iPods remain backwards-compatible with the Harman Kardon 2.5 and later models. This is the earliest audio system specifically engineered for iPod/iPhone integration, which predated CarPlay and every other manufacturer incorporating iOS into vehicles. [ 13 ] The concept of CarPlay was based on the iOS 4 feature called "iPod Out" which was produced through several years of joint development by Apple and the BMW Group's Technology Office USA. [ 14 ] iPod Out enabled vehicles with the necessary infrastructure to "host" the analog video and audio from a supporting iOS device while receiving inputs, such as button presses and knob rotations, from a car's infotainment system, to drive the "hosted" user interface in the vehicle's built-in display. It was announced at WWDC 2010 and first shipped in BMW Group vehicles in early 2011. The BMW and Mini option was called "PlugIn" and paved the way for the first cross-OEM platforms, introducing the concept of requiring a car-specific interface for apps (as opposed to MirrorLink's simple and insufficient mirroring of what was shown on the smartphone's screen). [ 15 ] Development [ edit ] CarPlay's codename was Stark . [ 16 ] Apple's Eddy Cue announced it as iOS in the Car at WWDC 2013. [ 17 ] In January 2014, it was reported that Apple's hardware-oriented corporate culture had led to release delays. [ 18 ] iOS in the Car was then rebranded and launched as CarPlay with significant design changes at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2014 [ 19 ] with Ferrari , Kia , Mercedes-Benz , and Volvo among the first car manufacturers. [ 20 ] At WWDC 2022, Apple announced plans to release an all-new version of CarPlay, informally dubbed CarPlay 2. The new version was said to be able to control vehicle functions, access vehicle stats, and take over multiple vehicle screens. Officials said they planned to release it in late 2024 [ 21 ] and that manufacturers that are planning to adopt the new CarPlay include: Audi, Acura, Ford, Honda, Infiniti, Jaguar, Land Rover, Lincoln, Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Polestar, Porsche, Renault, and Volvo. [ 22 ] On January 2025, amidst delays, Apple removed the planned released date from its website. [ 23 ] On May 15, 2025, Apple announced that next-generation CarPlay, now called CarPlay Ultra , would be included with all new vehicles from Aston Martin . Existing vehicles will also be receiving CarPlay Ultra through a future software update. [ 24 ] It is only available in the US and Canada .

Turn-by-turn guidance was also added to the maps app, including searching for points of interests and navigating to a destination. iOS 12 added support for third-party navigation apps like Google Maps or Waze . It also increased performance in some areas, while the maps app gains new data based on dtat collected by Apple. [ 62 ] iOS 13 introduced a complete redesign which presents a split layout of maps, media information, Calendar, or Siri Suggestions. It also added Calendar , the News app, and the Settings App to the home screen, a Settings app to enable users to configure certain CarPlay specific settings, such as switching between light and dark modes, adjusting album art in CarPlay’s Now Playing screen, or enabling Do Not Disturb While Driving while in a CarPlay session, [ 63 ] while making the iPhone be able to be independently controlled from the dashboard. In iOS 13.4, third-party map apps gained the ability to be displayed on the Dashboard. [ 64 ] [ 65 ] iOS 14 added a few new features, including new preset wallpapers , [ 66 ] the ability to run food-ordering and parking apps, [ 9 ] a revamped Siri UI which no longer takes up the entire screen, a new horizontal status bar, and support for enhanced audio messaging and VoIP apps. iOS 15 added a "city experience" to Apple Maps , replaced do not disturb with the Focus mode, added the option for a onscreen keyboard input as an alternative to voice recognition, and revamped the maps app, featuring a 3D globe with a new color palette and increased mountain, desert, and forest detail, increased traffic information, turn lanes, bike, bus and taxi lanes, medians, and crosswalks, alongside a including a new map where details such as traffic and incidents are highlighted, as well as an itinerary planner that lets the user view a future journey by selecting departure or arrival time.

Competition [ edit ] MirrorLink is a standard for car-smartphone connectivity, currently implemented in vehicles by Honda, Volkswagen, SEAT, Buick, Skoda, Mercedes-Benz, Citroën, and Smart with phones by manufacturers including Apple, HTC, Samsung, and Sony. [ 73 ] [ 74 ] The Open Automotive Alliance 's proprietary Android Auto is like CarPlay for Android devices. Huawei 's HiCar is like CarPlay for Huawei EMUI Android and HarmonyOS devices. [ 75 ] Tesla and Rivian 's infotainment systems exclude support for CarPlay and Android Auto. [ 76 ] Some vehicle manufacturers have their own systems for syncing the car with smartphones. Examples include BMW ConnectedDrive , NissanConnect , Hyundai Blue Link , iLane , MyFord Touch , Ford SYNC , OnStar , and Toyota Entune . In April 2023, General Motors announced that it would gradually stop including Apple CarPlay and Android Auto in its electric vehicles so that it could collect and monetize more driver data and deliver a better user experience. [ 77 ] Consumers criticized GM's action. The Detroit Free Press reported that some longtime GM customers said the lack of CarPlay would lead them to look at buying a Ford vehicle instead. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] Some press reported that the move would promote GM's partnership with Google and would cut off revenue streams to Apple at the expense of its customers. Some noted that the move would severely reduce customers' data privacy . [ 80 ] [ 81 ] [ 82 ] [ 83 ] References [ edit ] ^ "iOS - CarPlay - Available Models" . Apple .
