The W205 C-Class was preceded by the W204 C-Class and superseded by the W206 C-Class . The fourth-generation C-Class was available in sedan (W205), station wagon/estate (S205), coupe (C205), cabriolet (A205) and long-wheelbase sedan (V205) body styles. The W205 was the first vehicle to use the all-new Modular Rear Architecture (MRA) platform . The new structure is significantly lighter, using aluminum extensively throughout the body, resulting in a 100 kg (220 lb) weight decrease. [ 9 ] According to Mercedes-Benz, the structure is much more rigid than other vehicles in its class. [ 10 ] Development and launch [ edit ] W205 Exclusive sedan (pre-facelift) S205 (pre-facelift) Interior (pre-facelift) The car was presented on 16 December 2013 and  at the 2014 North American International Auto Show . [ 11 ] W205 production commenced on 4 February 2014 at the Bremen plant. [ 12 ] European sales began in March 2014, while the vehicle went on sale in North America in September 2014, and in South Africa in March 2015. As the Mercedes-Benz CLA-Class (released in April 2013) became the entry-level sedan in Mercedes' line up of cars, [ 13 ] with styling somewhat recalling the W222 S-Class . [ 14 ] The W205 included Sport and Luxury trims with 241 hp (180 kW) 2.0-liter turbocharged I4 engine and 329 hp (245 kW) 3.0-liter bi-turbo V6 engine options. Mercedes all-wheel drive 4MATIC is standard across the initial offering. The car is about 3.7 inches (94 mm) longer and 1.7 inches (43 mm) wider than the W204. [ 15 ] Based on the new modular MRA rear-wheel drive platform, it features front axle four-link and rear axle five-link suspension . Variants [ edit ] C 350e Plug-in Hybrid (2015–2019) [ edit ] C 350 e Plug-in Hybrid A plug-in hybrid version was introduced at the January 2015 North American International Auto Show , available in both Saloon and Estate variants. [ 16 ] The C 350e plug-in hybrid is powered by a four-cylinder gasoline engine, in conjunction with a 60 kW electric motor , delivering a total system output of 205 kW (275 hp) and torque of 600 N⋅m (443 lb⋅ft). The motor is powered by 6.2 kWh lithium-ion battery delivering an all-electric range of 31 km (19 mi), CO 2 emissions of 48 g/km and a fuel consumption of 2.1 L/100 km (130 mpg ‑imp ; 110 mpg ‑US ) under the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC). The C 350e has a haptic accelerator pedal. [ 17 ] In 2018, Mercedes-Benz released another plug-in hybrid C 350 – but this time it is a variant with a diesel engine. [ 18 ] C-Class Coupé (2015–2023) [ edit ] C205 Coupé (pre-facelift) Debuted at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show , the appearance of the C-Class coupe leans heavily on that of the 2014 C-Class saloon. The two cars share the same basic front-end styling treatment through to the leading edge of the doors. From the back, the second-generation C-Class Coupé closely mimics the design of the 2014 S-Class Coupé . [ 19 ] The interior uses the same dashboard and switchgear as the 2014 C-Class saloon, but the C-Class coupe receives unique front sports seats with integral headrests as well as two individual rear seats. Because of the absence of a B-pillar , there is also a standard automatic seatbelt feeder similar to that used by the 2014 E-Class Coupé . [ 19 ] A Bluetooth-compatible entertainment system allowing internet capability through a mobile phone is standard. Also included is the Attention Assist function, which warns the driver of inattentiveness and drowsiness. It is joined by Collision Prevention Assist, which can carry out autonomous braking at speeds up to 124 mph (200 km/h) in combination with a further standard system called Adaptive Brake Assist. [ 19 ] As part of Mercedes-Benz's efforts to establish itself at the forefront of autonomous driving technology, the 2015 C-Class Coupé also comes with an optional Distronic Plus system. It enables the Coupé to autonomously steer in order to remain in its lane at speeds between 0 and 124 mph (0 and 200 km/h). [ 19 ] C-Class Cabriolet (2016–2023) [ edit ] A205 Cabriolet (pre-facelift; soft-top retracted) A205 Cabriolet (facelift) A205 Cabriolet (facelift) Mercedes-Benz's first-ever C-Class Cabriolet (in fact the only compact cabriolet since 1955) was revealed at the 2016 Geneva Motor Show . Based on the C-Class Coupé, the four-seat soft-top keeps the same basic dimensions as the coupé, but is marginally taller. Its fabric roof can be opened or closed in 20 seconds at up to 50 km/h (31 mph). When open, the roof is stored in the trunk. [ 20 ] The interior of the C-Class Cabriolet is almost identical to that of the coupé but includes heat-reflecting leather and a switch on the centre console to open and close the roof. The sports seats also include Mercedes’ AIRSCARF heating system, while the AIRCAP system stops draughts inside the cabin.

It has a more powerful version of the twin-turbo 3.0 litre V6 producing 362 hp (270 kW) and 384 lb⋅ft (521 N⋅m) of torque. Some components, such as the front axle, steering system and suspension are shared with the C 63. It has all-wheel drive and is paired to a 7-speed automatic transmission. It reaches 62 mph (100 km/h) in 4.9 seconds. [ 21 ] For the 2017 model year, the C450 AMG was renamed to AMG C 43. It retains the same 3.0-litre twin-turbo but is now mated with a 9-speed automatic transmission and some cosmetic changes as well as becoming available in a coupé rather than sedan. 2017-2018 AMG C 43/63 had the option to add the AMG Performance Exhaust (PE), which allowed the driver to open and close the flaps on the factory-valved exhaust with the touch of a button within the cabin. This allowed the ability to operate the car in a quiet and docile manner but also the ability to unleash an aggressive exhaust note with pops, bangs, and burbles. 2019+ AMG models equipped with the PE had the exhaust muted significantly due to noise and emission regulations making 2018 the final year of its aggressive nature. AMG C 63/C 63 S (2015–2021) [ edit ] The AMG C 63 uses a similar 4.0-liter twin-turbocharged V8 to the Mercedes-AMG GT sports car. Mercedes offers it with two outputs: 469 hp (350 kW) and 650 N⋅m (479 lb⋅ft) of torque for the C 63 and 503 hp (375 kW) and 700 N⋅m (516 lb⋅ft) of torque for the more potent C 63 S. By moving to the downsized and turbocharged engine, Mercedes claims the W205 version consumes 32 percent less fuel than the model it replaced. [ 22 ] The C 63 should also be able to complete the 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) sprint in 4.1 seconds with a top speed electronically limited to 250 km/h (155 mph), and 3.9 seconds in the S variant with a top speed of 290 km/h (180 mph) with a special request from AMG to raise the speed limiter. [ 23 ] The car still uses a seven-speed automatic transmission that sends power to the rear wheels and three-stage adaptive dampers specific to AMG models along with speed-sensitive variable steering. High-performance brakes are also a part of the package with 390 mm (15.4 in) discs in front and 360 mm (14.2 in) discs in the rear. On both ends of the car, there are AMG-branded calipers. Its first deliveries took place in early 2015 for the European market with a U.S. debut later in the year. [ 22 ] The Estate variant served as the official Medical Car of Formula One between 2015 and 2021, and has since been replaced by the Mercedes-AMG GT 4-Door Coupé . Mercedes-AMG C 63 (Facelift) Mercedes-AMG C 63 S Edition 1 Mercedes-AMG C 63 S Edition 1 (rear) AMG C 63/C 63 S Coupe & Cabriolet (2016–2022) [ edit ] Mercedes-Benz C 63 AMG cabriolet Mercedes-Benz C 63 S AMG coupe Mercedes-Benz also revealed the high-performance C 63 coupe from Mercedes-AMG at the 2015 Frankfurt Auto Show . The C 63 coupe features many distinct design elements to set it apart from its tamer sibling. The most obvious is the aggressive front bumper, which features larger scoops to feed more air to the car's twin-turbocharged 4.0-litre V-8 as well as to its high-performance brakes. The grille is also unique, and the hood features some muscular ripples that the regular C-Class Coupe does not. [ 24 ] The C 63 coupe also benefits from a wider track, as evidenced by the pumped wheel arches. The wheels are also bigger on the Mercedes-AMG model with 19 inches in diameter. The C-Class Coupe comes with 18-inch wheels as standard. [ 24 ] The mechanical package is almost identical to the C 63 sedan. This means 469 hp (350 kW) in the C 63 coupe and 503 hp (375 kW) for the S-badged model. Drive will be to the rear wheels only, via a paddle-shifted, seven-speed automatic transmission. [ 25 ] 2018 facelift [ edit ] W205 facelift The facelift features C-shaped light guides in the LED tail lights on the sedan models. Interior (facelift) The facelift versions were released in 2018 for the 2019 model year. Changes include: LED headlights plus LED DRLs as standard. Option for the LED High-Performance headlamps or the Multibeam LED headlights with Ultra Range High Beam units. [ 26 ] Can be equipped with the 12.3-inch infotainment display and a 10.25-inch free-standing infotainment display. [ 27 ] Semi-autonomous features such as Active Lane Assist, Active Emergency Stop Assist and Active Steering Assist. Mercedes's DISTRONIC feature uses satellite data to control the cruising speed. [ 26 ] An updated interior design, with silver elements. The car also got new colour options for the interior, namely, Magma Grey, Black and Saddle Brown. [ 26 ] The steering wheel now features touchpads for controlling both displays, and the optional centre console touchpad now features haptic feedback. [ 28 ] New Energizing comfort control system that links the climate control, air fragrance and seat heating, ventilation and massage functions. [ 28 ] Three diesel models: the 148 hp C 200d, 192 hp C 220d (which arrived first) and 241 hp C 300d. Each runs Mercedes’ latest 2.0-litre four-cylinder diesel engine. [ 27 ] Three petrol models feature in the line-up: the C 180, C 200 (the first to go on sale) and C 300. The C 180 uses a 1.6-litre turbo engine that produces 154 bhp in the SLC 180. The C 200 and C 300 both have Mercedes’ new four-cylinder petrol engine. [ 27 ] In the C 200, the mild hybrid with EQ Boost badging, the engine delivers a nominal 181 hp, with an added 13 hp available on kick down when the alternator acts as an electric motor to boost performance. [ 27 ] In the C 300, the engine is in a higher state of tune, at 255 hp, but does not have electric assistance. [ 27 ] A nine-speed 9G-TRONIC transmission is expected to remain standard on all but the most basic of models. [ 27 ] Due to emissions and noise regulations, the factory AMG Performance Exhaust (PE) was muted significantly on AMG C 43/63 models worldwide.
