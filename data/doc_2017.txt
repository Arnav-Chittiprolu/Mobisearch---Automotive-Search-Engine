It was Mazda's first SUV , and was offered with a choice of rear-wheel drive or four-wheel drive. The Navajo won the 1991 Motor Trend Truck of the Year award, but because of its Explorer origins, its reputation deteriorated amid the Firestone and Ford tire controversy . [ 1 ] Differences [ edit ] Mazda Navajo The Navajo featured a few minor changes from the Explorer it was based on. It was given a revised front fascia, new taillamps and wheels, and the bumpers were painted dark gray (resulting in the deletion of all chrome trim). [ 1 ] The interior was largely shared between the two model lines, with the Navajo receiving its own lettering for the instrument panel (in line with other Mazda vehicles), and Mazda lettering was added to the Ford steering wheel hub. Trims [ edit ] In place of the three trims offered on the three-door Ford Explorer, Mazda offered the Navajo in base DX and top-tier LX trim (roughly the equivalent of the Explorer Sport and three-door Explorer XLT). Offered only with four-wheel drive at its launch, a rear-wheel drive version of the Navajo was introduced for 1992. [ 2 ] As with the first-generation Explorer, all Navajos were fitted with a 4.0 L V6 producing 160 hp (119 kW); a five-speed manual was standard, with a four-speed automatic offered as an option (on both the DX and LX). Criticisms and controversies [ edit ] Rollover and Firestone Tire controversy [ edit ] Main article: Firestone vs Ford Motor Company controversy Use of Navajo name [ edit ] Some criticized Mazda's use of the Navajo name without compensating the Navajo people , considering it exploitative . During a 1990 unveiling ceremony, Mazda spokesperson Duane Bowen responded to the criticism by saying that the name was chosen as "uniquely American," and a symbol of strength and integrity. To address the criticism, Mazda donated a 1991 model Navajo to the tribe, which was officially accepted by the Government Services Committee of Torreon, New Mexico . [ 3 ] Discontinuation [ edit ] Production of the Mazda Navajo came to an end after three years. The Navajo was replaced by the Ford Escape -based Mazda Tribute .
