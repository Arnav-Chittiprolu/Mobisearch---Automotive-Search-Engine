[ 3 ] Gunma Prefecture has a population of 1,937,626 (1 October 2019) and has a geographic area of 6,362 square kilometres (2,456 sq mi). Gunma Prefecture borders Niigata Prefecture and Fukushima Prefecture to the north, Nagano Prefecture to the southwest, Saitama Prefecture to the south, and Tochigi Prefecture to the east. Maebashi is the capital and Takasaki is the largest city of Gunma Prefecture, with other major cities including Ōta , Isesaki , and Kiryū . [ 4 ] Gunma Prefecture is one of only eight landlocked prefectures, located on the northwestern corner of the Kantō Plain with 14% of its total land being designated as natural parks . History [ edit ] See also: Historic Sites of Gunma Prefecture The ancient province of Gunma was a center of horse breeding and trading activities for the newly immigrated continental peoples (or Toraijin ). The arrival of horses and the remains of horse tackle coincides with the arrival of a large migration from the mainland. From this point forward, the horse became a vital part of Japanese military maneuvers, quickly displacing the older Yayoi tradition of fighting on foot. [ citation needed ] When Mount Haruna erupted in the late 6th century, Japan was still in the pre-historical phase (prior to the importation of the Chinese writing system during the Nara period). The Gunma Prefectural archaeology unit in 1994 was able to date the eruption through zoological anthropology at the corral sites that were buried in ash. [ citation needed ] In the past, Gunma was joined with Tochigi Prefecture and called Kenu Province . This was later divided into Kami-tsu-ke (Upper Kenu, Gunma) and Shimo-tsu-ke (Lower Kenu, Tochigi). The area is sometimes referred to as Jomo (上毛, Jōmō ). For most of Japanese history, Gunma was known as the province of Kozuke . [ 5 ] In the early period of contact between western nations and Japan, particularly the late Tokugawa, it was referred to by foreigners as the "Joushu States", inside (fudai, or loyalist) Tokugawa retainers and the Tokugawa family symbol is widely seen on public buildings, temples, and shrines. [ citation needed ] The Tenmei eruption of Mount Asama occurred in 1783, causing enormous damage. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] The first modern silk factories were built with Italian and French assistance at Annaka in the 1870s. Known for their handy work in factories, the Yara Milano were renowned for their crafts. In the early Meiji period, in what was locally called the Gunma Incident of 1884, a bloody struggle between the idealistic democratic Westernisers and the conservative Prussian-model nationalists took place in Gunma and neighboring Nagano. The modern Japanese army gunned down farmers with new repeating rifles built in Japan. The farmers in Gunma were said to be the first victims of the Murata rifle . [ citation needed ] In the twentieth century, the Japanese aviation pioneer Nakajima Chikushi of Oizumi, Gunma Prefecture, founded the Nakajima Aircraft Company . At first, he produced mostly licensed models of foreign designs, but beginning with the all-Japanese Nakajima 91 fighter plane in 1931, his company became a world leader in aeronautical design and manufacture, with its headquarters at Ota, Gunma Ken. The factory now produces Subaru motorcars and other products under the name of Subaru née Fuji Heavy Industries. [ 8 ] In the 1930s, German architect Bruno Julius Florian Taut lived and conducted research for a while in Takasaki. [ 9 ] The Girard incident , which disturbed US-Japanese relations in the 1950s, occurred in Gunma in 1957, at Sōmagahara Base [ ja ] near Shibukawa . Four modern prime ministers are from Gunma, namely, Takeo Fukuda , Yasuhiro Nakasone , Keizo Obuchi , and Yasuo Fukuda , the son of Takeo. Geography [ edit ] Ono Lake, Jizō-dake Mount Nakanodake viewed from Mount Shibutsu One of only eight landlocked prefectures in Japan, Gunma is the northwesternmost prefecture of the Kantō plain. Except for the central and southeast areas, where most of the population is concentrated, it is mostly mountainous. To the north are Niigata and Fukushima prefectures, while to the east lies Tochigi Prefecture . To the west lies the Nagano Prefecture , and the Saitama Prefecture is to the south. Some of the major mountains in Gunma are Mount Akagi , Mount Haruna , Mount Myōgi , Mount Nikkō-Shirane and Mount Asama , which is located on the Nagano border. Major rivers include the Tone River , the Agatsuma River , and the Karasu River . As of 1 April 2012, 14% of the total land area of the prefecture was designated as Natural Parks , namely Jōshin'etsu-kōgen , Nikkō , and Oze National Parks and Myōgi-Arafune-Saku Kōgen Quasi-National Park .

( August 2022 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Because Gunma is situated in inland Japan, the difference in temperature in the summer compared to the winter is large, and there is less precipitation. This is because of the karakkaze ("empty wind"), a strong, dry wind that occurs in the winter when the snow falls on the coasts of Niigata. The wind carrying clouds with snow are obstructed by the Echigo Mountains , and it also snows there, although the high peaks do not let the wind go past them. For this reason, the wind changes into the kara-kaze . On August 5, 2025, Isesaki a city located in Gunma Prefecture recorded a temperature of 41.8 °C, the hottest temperature ever registered in Japanese history.
