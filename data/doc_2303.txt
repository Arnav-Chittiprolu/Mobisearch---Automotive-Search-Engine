It is a direct-administered municipality on the shore of the Bohai Sea making it separate from the surrounding Hebei province . It is one of the nine national central cities , with a total population of 13,866,009 inhabitants at the time of the 2020 Chinese census . Its metropolitan area , which is made up of 12 central districts (other than Baodi , Jizhou , Jinghai and Ninghe ), was home to 11,165,706 inhabitants in 2015 and is also the world's 29th-largest agglomeration (between Chengdu and Rio de Janeiro ) and 11th- most populous city proper . [ 6 ] Tianjin is governed as one of the four municipalities (alongside Beijing , Shanghai , and Chongqing ) under the direct administration of the State Council of China . However, it is the only municipality with a population of less than 20 million. [ 7 ] The city borders Hebei Province and Beijing Municipality , bounded to the east by the Bohai Gulf portion of the Yellow Sea . Part of the Bohai Economic Rim , it is the largest coastal city in Northern China and part of the Jing-Jin-Ji megapolis. In terms of urban population, Tianjin is the seventh largest city in China. In terms of administrative area population, Tianjin ranks fifth in mainland China. [ 8 ] The walled city of Tianjin was built in 1404. As a treaty port since 1860, Tianjin has been a seaport and gateway to Beijing. During the Boxer Rebellion , the city was the seat of the Tianjin Provisional Government . Under the Qing dynasty and the Republic of China, Tianjin became one of the largest cities in the region. [ 9 ] At that time, European-style buildings and mansions were constructed in concessions, some of which are preserved today. After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Tianjin suffered a depression due to the policy of the central government and the 1976 Tangshan earthquake ; however, it has been recovering since the 1990s. [ 10 ] Tianjin is classified as the largest type of port city, a Large-Port Megacity , due to its large urban population and port traffic volume. [ 11 ] Tianjin is currently a dual-core city, with its main urban area (including the older part of the city) located along the Hai River , which connects to the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers via the Grand Canal , and Binhai , an adjacent New Area urban core located east of the older part of the city on the coast of the Bohai Gulf. Since 2010, Tianjin's Yujiapu Financial District has become known as China's Manhattan [ 12 ] [ 13 ] and the city is considered to be one of the world's top 100 cities, [ 14 ] including in the Global Financial Centres Index . As of 2024, Tianjin was ranked as a Beta+ (global second tier) city together with Barcelona and Rome by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network . [ 15 ] In 2025, Tianjin held the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit . [ 16 ] Tianjin is ranked as the 15th leading city in the world with the highest scientific research outputs and second in the North China region after Beijing. [ 17 ] The municipality is also home to multiple institutes of higher education in Northern China, including Tianjin , Nankai , Tianjin Normal , Tianjin Medical , Tianjin Foreign Studies , Tiangong , Tianjin University of Science & Technology , Tianjin University of Technology , and Hebei University of Technology . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Name [ edit ] Tianjin is the pinyin spelling of the Chinese characters 天津 . The name literally means 'the ford of the emperor'. The origin of the name is disputed. One traditional theory says that it was an homage to the Chu poet Qu Yuan , whose " Li Sao " includes the verse "... departing from the Ford of Heaven at dawn ..." ( 朝發軔於天津兮 ; zhāo fārèn yú Tiānjīn xī ). Another says that it honors the former name of the Girl , a Chinese constellation recorded under the name Tianjin in the Astronomical Record section of the Book of Sui . A third says that it derives from a place name noted in the River Record of the History of Jin . The most common theory says that it was bestowed by the Yongle Emperor of the Ming , who crossed Tianjin's Gu River on his way south to overthrow his nephew, the Jianwen Emperor . [ 20 ] Prior to the introduction of pinyin, the city's name was historically romanized as Tientsin in the Chinese postal romanization . The current English spelling of Tianjin was adopted in 1958, after pinyin was introduced by the PRC government. Several countries, international organizations and media outlets have adopted the pinyin name since 1979. The Government of the Republic of China (ROC) has continued to use the postal and Wade–Giles spelling since the adoption of pinyin by the ROC government in 2009. History [ edit ] Early history [ edit ] Dule Temple is a structure dating back to China's Liao Dynasty , built in 984 AD. The land where Tianjin is now located was created in between 900 and 1300 CE by the sediments of rivers entering the sea at the Bohai Gulf , including the Yellow River, which entered the open sea in the area at one time. The construction of the Grand Canal under the Sui dynasty helped the future development of Tianjin, as the canal ran from Hangzhou to the Beijing and Tianjin region by 609 CE. Grain from southern China was regularly transported to the north through the canal and was used during the subsequent dynasties. Tianjin began to be increasingly mentioned in records during the Song dynasty and gained importance during the Yuan dynasty . Tianjin experienced development under the Yuan and became a location for the storage of goods and grains. Tianjin became a garrison town and shipping station during the Ming dynasty ; it was a center of commerce by the 17th century. [ 21 ] Qing dynasty [ edit ] During the Qing dynasty (1644–1911), the Tianjin Prefecture , or Zhou ( 州 ), was established in 1725, and Tianjin County was established within the prefecture in 1731. Later, it became an urban prefecture or Fu ( 府 ), before becoming a relay station ( 駐 地 ) under the command of the Viceroy of Zhili . 1913 map of Tianjin Opening up as a treaty port [ edit ] See also: Concessions in Tianjin In 1856, Chinese soldiers boarded The Arrow , a Chinese-owned ship registered in Hong Kong that flew the British flag and which was suspected of piracy, smuggling, and involvement in the opium trade. The soldiers captured twelve men and imprisoned them. In response, the British and French sent gunboats under the command of Admiral Sir Michael Seymour to capture the Taku forts near Tianjin in May 1858. At the end of the first part of the Second Opium War in June of the same year, the British and French prevailed, and the Treaty of Tientsin was signed, which opened Tianjin (Tientsin) to foreign trade. The treaties were ratified by the Xianfeng Emperor in 1860, so Tianjin was formally opened to Great Britain and France and thus to the outside world. Between 1895 and 1900, Britain and France were joined by Japan, Germany and Russia , and some countries without Chinese concessions , such as Austria-Hungary , Italy and Belgium , in establishing self-contained concessions in Tianjin , each with its own prisons, schools, barracks and hospitals. [ 22 ] These nations left architectural reminders of their rule, which include churches and thousands of villas. Church of Our Lady's Victories, built in 1869, was the site of the Tianjin Church Massacre . The presence of foreign influence in Tianjin was not always peaceful; one violent incident was that of the Tianjin Church Massacre . In June 1870, the orphanage held by the Wanghailou Church (translated as Church Our Lady's Victories [ citation needed ] ) in Tianjin, which built by French Roman Catholic missionaries , was accused of kidnapping and brainwashing Chinese children. On June 21, the magistrate of Tianjin County initiated a conflict at the church that developed into violent clashes between the church's Christian supporters and some non-Christian Tianjin residents. The protesters eventually burned down Wanghailou Church and the nearby French consulate, killing eighteen foreigners, including ten French nuns, the French consul, and merchants. France and six other Western nations complained to the Qing government, which was forced to pay compensation for the incident. Haihe River in Tianjin In 1885, Li Hongzhang founded the Tianjin Military Academy ( 天津武備學堂 ) for Chinese army officers with German advisors as a part of his military reforms. [ 23 ] The academy's founding was supported by the Anhui Army commander Zhou Shengchuan. [ 23 ] : 267 The academy was to serve the Anhui Army and the Green Standard Army officers. The instructors were German officers. [ 23 ] : 267 In 1887, the academy started a program to train teenagers to become army officers; the program continued for five years. [ 23 ] : 268 Practical and technical subjects including sciences, foreign languages, Chinese literature, mathematics, and history were taught at the school and exams were administered to students. The lessons taught at the Tianjin Military Academy were copied for the Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools. [ 23 ] : 268 A maritime defense fund supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was located in the same area as the Tianjin Naval Academy. [ 23 ] : 268 In 1886, the Tianjin Military Academy adopted Romance of the Three Kingdoms as part of its curriculum. [ 24 ] Among its alumni were Wang Yingkai and Duan Qirui ; its staff included Yinchang . Peiyang University , established 1895 In June 1900, the Boxers were able to seize control of parts of Tianjin. On June 26, European defense forces heading towards Beijing were stopped by Boxers at nearby Langfang ; they were defeated and forced to turn back to Tianjin. The foreign concessions were also under siege for several weeks. The HSBC Tianjin Branch was the first foreign bank in the Tianjin Concession, and the building is now occupied by the Bank of China. The Yokohama Specie Bank Tianjin Branch was a Japanese bank established in Tianjin during the period of Japan's invasion of China. The building is now used by the Bank of China. In July 1900, the Eight-Nation Alliance recaptured Tianjin . This alliance soon established the Tianjin Provisional Government, which was composed of representatives from each of the occupying forces (Russia, Britain, Japan, Germany, France, America, Austro-Hungary, and Italy). The city was governed by this council until August 15, 1902, when the city was returned to Qing control. Qing General Yuan Shikai led efforts to transform Tianjin into a modern city, establishing the first modern Chinese police force. In 1907, Yuan supervised China's first modern democratic elections for a county council. Major crossing (Rue Général Foch and Rue de Chaylard) of downtown Tianjin in French concession Western nations were permitted to garrison the area to ensure open access to Beijing. The British maintained a brigade of two battalions in Tianjin, and the Italians, French, Japanese, Germans, Russians, and Austro-Hungarians maintained their forces using strength regiments; the United States did not initially participate. During World War I , the German and Austro-Hungarian garrisons were captured as prisoners of war by Allied Forces ; meanwhile, in 1918, the Bolshevik government withdrew the Russian garrison. In 1920, the remaining participating nations asked the United States to join them, and the US then sent the 15th Infantry Regiment , minus one battalion, to Tianjin from the Philippines. Because of the development of industry, commerce and finance in the city, Tianjin was established as a municipality of China in 1927. From 1930 to 1935, Tianjin was the provincial capital of Hebei ; afterwards, it was reestablished as an independent municipality. Garrison duty was highly regarded by the troops. General George C. Marshall , the "architect of victory" in World War II, during which he was the Chief of Staff of the United States Army , served in Tianjin in the 1920s as the Executive Officer of the 15th Infantry. The US withdrew the infantry unit in 1938, but the nation's presence was maintained by the dispatch of a small US Marine Corps unit from the Embassy Guard at Beijing. Asahi Street (now Heping Road) in 1939 Tianjin flood Second Sino-Japanese War [ edit ] On July 30, 1937, during the Second Sino-Japanese War , Tianjin fell to Japan, but was not entirely occupied, as the Japanese generally respected foreign concessions until 1941, when American and British concessions were occupied. In the summer of 1939, the Tientsin Incident damaged Anglo-Japanese relations. On June 14, 1939, the Imperial Japanese Army surrounded and blockaded a British concession due to the refusal of British authorities to transfer six Chinese people, who had assassinated a Japanese collaborator and taken refuge in the British concession, to be under Japan's authority. For a time, the events of 1939 appeared likely to cause an Anglo-Japanese war, especially when reports of the Japanese Army mistreating British subjects wishing to leave or enter the concession appeared in British newspapers. The situation ended when British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was advised by the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office that the only way to force the Japanese to lift the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and that given the situation in Europe, it would be inappropriate to send the British fleet out of European waters, thus leading the British to finally turn over the six Chinese people, who were then executed by the Japanese. During the Japanese occupation, Tianjin was ruled by the North China Executive Committee , a puppet state based in Beijing. On August 9, 1940, all of the British troops in Tianjin were ordered to withdraw. On November 14, 1941, the American Marine unit stationed in Tianjin was ordered to leave, but before it left, the Japanese attacked the United States . The American Marine detachment surrendered to the Japanese on December 8, 1941. Only the Italian and French concessions (the local French officials were loyal to Vichy ) were allowed by the Japanese to remain. When Italy signed an armistice with the Allies in September 1943, Japanese troops took the Italian concession, following a battle with its garrison, and the Italian Social Republic formally ceded the concession to Wang Jingwei 's Japan-controlled puppet state . Japanese occupation of the city lasted until August 15, 1945, with the surrender of Japan marking the end of World War II. After World War II [ edit ] P.R.China's 10th anniversary parade in Tianjin in 1959 In the Pingjin Campaign of the Chinese Civil War, the city was captured after 29 hours of fighting. The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) took Tianjin on January 15, 1949. From 1949 to February 1958, Tianjin was a municipality directly under the control of the central government. In October 1952, Tanggu New Port officially opened its doors, and the first 10,000-ton ferry arrived at Newport Pier. In February 1958, due to the "Great Leap Forward" and the city's industrial foundation, Tianjin was incorporated into Hebei Province , the capital of which was relocated to Tianjin for eight years. During the period, under the coordination of the State Council, the city of Tianjin implemented a separate policy for central planning, which was independent of Hebei Province. However, a number of factories and colleges in Tianjin moved to Hebei, hindering Tianjin's economic development. In January 1967, due to preparation and concerns that Tianjin would become a battlefield, Hebei Province repatriated its provincial capital to Baoding, and the CCP Central Committee decided that Tianjin should be restored to the central municipality and remain so. In April 1970, since the central government had applied for funding for the construction of the subway, the Tianjin Municipal Government decided to raise funds on its own to establish the project using the name of the channel and by build it on the basis of the old walled river. In July 1973, five counties, including Jixian, Baodi, Wuqing, Jinghai, and Ninghe, were formally placed under the jurisdiction of Tianjin. On July 28, 1976, during the 7.6 magnitude Tangshan Earthquake , Tianjin was affected by shock waves and experienced a loss of life. In the city, 24,345 people died and 21,497 were seriously injured. 60% of the city's buildings were destroyed and more than 30% of the enterprises and Peking Port Reservoir and Yuqiao Reservoir were seriously damaged. Nearly 700,000 people were left homeless. On October 10 of the same year, the Tianjin Underground Railway was opened to traffic. In 1981, Miyun Reservoir was built on the upper reaches of the Hai River; it is now used to supply water for Beijing; however; the reservoir stopped the river from supplying water to Tianjin, resulting in difficulty with water usage in the city. As a result, during 1976, the State Council of the People's Republic of China decided to initiate a project to solve the problem of water usage in Tianjin by attracting individuals to the city's academic centers. Monument of TEDA In 1984, during the beginning of the Chinese government's economic reforms, Tianjin was listed as one of the 14 coastal open cities by the State Council and the Tianjin Development Zone 's economy began to develop. However, the overall speed of development in Tianjin is still slower than that of special economic zones and that of other southeast coastal areas. In 1994, Tianjin began its industrial shift towards the east and developed the Binhai New Area , with the Tianjin Port as its core. In October 2005, the Fifth Plenary Session of the 16th CCP Central Committee convened; its meeting decided to incorporate the development and opening of the Binhai New Area into its Eleventh Five-Year Plan and the national development strategy. In March 2006, the State Council executive meeting positioned Tianjin as an "international port city, a northern economic center, and an ecological city." Since then, the dispute between the Beijing-Tianjin economic center at the policy level has come to an end. In May 2006, the State Council approved the Binhai New Area as a national integrated reform pilot area. In June of the same year, the State Council's Opinions on Promoting the Development and Opening of the Tianjin Binhai New Area were announced; they stated the following: "In financial enterprises, financial services, financial markets, and finance Major reforms such as opening up can, in principle, be scheduled to precede the Tianjin Binhai New Area." Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway In August 2008, China's first high-speed railway , the Beijing-Tianjin Intercity Railway , which has a speed of 350 kilometers per hour, was opened. In August 2008, Tianjin was the co-host city of the 29th Olympic Games . In September 2008, the Annual Meeting of the New Champions of World Economic Forum (also called Summer Davos ) began to be established in Tianjin; it is now held every two years. [ 25 ] In October 2010, the UN Climate Change Conference convened in Tianjin. [ 26 ] In 2012, the Tianjin Metro Lines 2, 3, and 9 were completed and open to traffic, and Tianjin Rail Transit was formally networked. CBD in Tianjin In October 2013, Tianjin hosted an international comprehensive event for the first time by hosting the East Asian Games . In 2014, the coordinated development of Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei was officially incorporated into the national strategy; Tianjin was positioned as the National Advanced Manufacturing R&D Base, Northern International Shipping Core Area, Financial Innovation Operation Demonstration Area, and Reform and Opening-up Preceding Area. In the same year, the first phase of the South-to-North Water Transfer Project was completed, so water availability in Tianjin increased. On February 26, 2015, the Tianjin National Independent Innovation Demonstration Zone was formally established. On April 21, the China (Tianjin) Free Trade Pilot Zone was also formally established. On April 27, Jincheng Bank , the first private bank in northern China, officially opened its doors. 2025 Tianjin SCO summit On August 12, 2015, a fire and explosion occurred in a chemical warehouse in Tianjin Port , causing 173 deaths, hundreds of injuries, and property losses. [ 27 ] The cost to businesses caused by the explosion was estimated to be $9 billion, making it the most expensive supply chain disruption of 2015. In 2025, Tianjin held the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit . [ 16 ] Geography [ edit ] Population density and low elevation coastal zones in the Tianjin area. Tianjin is particularly vulnerable to sea level rise . Tianjin (labeled as T'IEN-CHIN (TIENTSIN) 天津) (1955) Map of the Hai River Basin 2011 satellite image of Tianjin. The city center is on the left, while the smaller urban area to the right is the Binhai New Area . Hai River in 2011 Tianjin is located on the west coast of the Bohai Gulf ; the provinces of Shandong and Liaoning are located across those waters. The city is bordered by Beijing , which is 120 kilometers (75 mi) to the northwest. Tianjin is surrounded on all sides by Hebei , with the exception of its eastern border, which is the Bohai Sea . With a latitude ranging from 38° 34' to 40° 15' N and a longitude ranging from 116° 43' to 118° 04' E, the total area of the city is 11,860.63 square kilometers (4,579.41 sq mi). The city has 153 km (95 mi) of coastline and 1,137.48 kilometers (706.80 mi) of land border. [ 28 ] It is located at the northern end of the Grand Canal of China , which connects with the Yellow and Yangtze Rivers . The municipality is generally flat and is swampy near the coast; however, it has hills in the north, where the Yan Mountains enter Tianjin. Tidal flats occur on the coastal plain adjacent to the city. [ 29 ] The highest point in the municipality is Jiuding Peak ( 九顶山 ) in Ji County on the northern border with Hebei; the mountain has an altitude of 1,078.5 m (3,538 ft). In the Tianjin Municipality, the Hai River forms at the confluence of the Ziya River ( 子牙河 ), Daqing River ( 大清河 ), Yongding River , North Grand Canal , and South Grand Canal ; it enters the Pacific Ocean within the municipality as well as in Tanggu District . Reservoirs include the Beidagang Reservoir in the south (in Dagang District ) and the Yuqiao Reservoir in the north in Ji County . Climate [ edit ] Tianjin has a semi-arid climate (using the Köppen system, the city has a BSk climate bordering on Dwa and Cwa ). As in other areas of East Asia, the city has a four-season, monsoon -influenced climate; it also has cold, windy, and dry winters due to the Siberian anticyclone and hot, humid summers due to the monsoon season. Spring in the city is dry and windy; the season sometimes consists of sandstorms blowing in from the Gobi Desert , which are capable of lasting for several days. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from −2.8 °C (27.0 °F) in January to 27.2 °C (81.0 °F) in July, with an annual mean of 13.3 °C (55.9 °F). Extreme temperatures in the city at the main weather station in Xiqing District have ranged from −22.9 °C (−9 °F) to 41.1 °C (106 °F). [ 30 ] With the monthly percentage of the possible amount of sunshine ranging from 45% in July to 61% in March and April, the city receives 2,460 hours of sunshine annually. Having an annual total precipitation of 521 millimeters (20.5 in), with nearly three-fifths of it occurring in July and August alone, the city lies within the semi-arid climate zone, although parts of the municipality are humid continental ( Köppen BSk / Dwa , respectively).

These measures included several methods to restrict pollution on days when is severe, such as by halving the number of vehicles allowed on roads, halting construction and manufacturing activity, closing schools, and halting large-scale outdoor activities. [ 35 ] In the past, flights have also been grounded and highways have been closed.

In fact, Tianjin is considered to have become the censorship capitol for Chinese Internet. [ 13 ] [ 67 ] Tourism [ edit ] Crosstalk in Tianjin The city blends nineteenth- and early twentieth-century European architecture with modern Chinese concrete-and-glass structures. While redevelopment continues, much colonial architecture is protected. In the nineteenth century, Western powers seized the port city after a dispute over a British ship. Armed gunboats defeated Chinese forces, and the Treaty of Tianjin (1856) granted Europeans nine concessions along the Hai River to trade and sell opium. These enclaves were self-contained: the French built châteaus and towers, Germans red-tiled Bavarian villas. Tensions erupted in the Tianjin Incident (1870) at a French orphanage and again during the Boxer Rebellion (1900), when foreigners demolished the old city walls to monitor residents. The old city was largely demolished in 2000–2001, leaving only a few historic buildings, such as the Tianjin Temple of Confucius. Today, the former concession streets south and west of the central station and south of the Hai River draw visitors. The French châteaus form the downtown south of the river, British mansions lie east, and further east and south, German-style buildings remain. Scenic Areas [ edit ] Tianjin contains three national nature reserves. Among them, Baxianshan has largely preserved its original forest ecology due to long-term minimal human interference. The Middle–Upper Yuan Geologic National Nature Reserve in Jizhou District has been recognized by the International Union of Geological Sciences as a standard global stratigraphic section. The Tianjin Ancient Coast and Wetlands National Nature Reserve features three typical shell ridges, clearly documenting the geological evolution from marine retreat to land formation on the Tianjin Plain. [ 68 ] In terms of cultural landscapes, Tianjin hosts two World Cultural Heritage sites: the Huangyaguan Great Wall in the northern part of Jizhou District and the Tianjin section of the Beijing–Hangzhou Grand Canal . Ancient Culture Street is a national 5A tourist attraction, with the Tianhou Temple as its core structure. It is the oldest existing historical building complex in Tianjin and a significant northern Chinese site representing Mazu culture [ 68 ] . Additionally, Yangliuqing Town is renowned for Yangliuqing New Year Paintings and has been designated a “China Historical and Cultural Town”. Within the urban area, both banks of the Haihe River feature a mixture of traditional Chinese, European, and modern architecture, gradually forming a distinctive cityscape. The “one bridge, one scene” illuminated nightscape along the Haihe has made the river a famous landmark and a prominent sightseeing destination for international visitors during major events such as the World Economic Forum . In August 2018, Time ranked the Tianjin Binhai Library in Binhai New Area first on its “World's 100 Greatest Places of 2018” list. Jizhou Panshan Scenic Area Binhai Library Wuqing Florentia Village, Tianjin Five Great Avenues Minyuan Square Museums and Exhibition Halls [ edit ] Tianjin's museum tradition began during the late Qing reform era [ 69 ] . In 1914, the French Jesuit priest and naturalist Émile Licent established the Musée Hoangho Paiho , one of China's earliest museums, which played a key role in paleontology, geology, archaeology, and museology [ 70 ] . Currently, Tianjin has three national first-class museums: Tianjin Museum , Tianjin Natural History Museum , and the Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao Memorial Hall . The Tianjin Museum is a comprehensive history and art museum, tracing its origins to the Tianjin Museum established in 1918 [ 71 ] . The Tianjin Natural History Museum is a large, multidisciplinary natural history museum covering zoology, botany, paleontology, and geology, originating from the Musée Hoangho Paiho [ 72 ] . The Zhou Enlai and Deng Yingchao Memorial Hall , located at Water Park , commemorates the first Premier of the People's Republic of China Zhou Enlai and his wife Deng Yingchao, who studied in Tianjin during their youth [ 73 ] . In May 2019, the National Maritime Museum of China in the Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City opened as China's first national, comprehensive, and public-oriented maritime museum [ 74 ] . Tianjin also hosts specialized and thematic exhibition halls such as the Tianjin Science and Technology Museum , Tianjin Urban Planning Exhibition Hall , and Pingjin Campaign Memorial Hall , providing cultural and scientific experiences for residents and visitors. Urban and Suburban Parks [ edit ] Since 2008, Tianjin has gradually upgraded city parks and squares, removing entrance fees and making them freely accessible to the public [ 75 ] . Major urban parks include Water Park , Tianjin Zoo , Nancuiping Park , Shuixi Park , Beining Park , Meijiang Park , Ergong Park , Zhongshan Park , Haihe Music Park , Central Park , People's Park , Hedong Park , Five Great Avenues Park , and Xigu Park . [ 76 ] Beining Park was originally a plantation built in 1906 by the industrialist Zhou Xuexi and was later renamed “Ningyuan” for its motto “Without tranquility, one cannot reach far.” Major parks in Binhai New Area include Haihe Bund Park , Taifeng Park , Ziyun Park , South Embankment Coastal Trail Park, East Embankment Park, Shell Ridge Wetland Park, Aircraft Carrier Park , and Haigang Park . Shuixi Park officially opened in October 2018. Since 2011, Tianjin has planned and constructed 16 suburban parks in and around the city and Binhai New Area. Compared with urban parks, suburban parks feature more natural landscapes and rural characteristics. [ 77 ] Construction of the Beiyunhe Suburban Park in northern Tianjin and the Xiqing Suburban Park in the southwest began in 2012. By 2014, the 16 suburban parks were incorporated into the ecological redline, with a total core area of 66,855 hectares. [ 78 ] Nightscape [ edit ] Tianjin first installed street lighting in 1902. By the 1930s, the city's illuminated streets had earned it the nickname “Northern City That Never Sleeps.” Currently, the city's nightscape is incorporated into specialized urban planning. In the central districts, lighting forms a “fishbone” pattern along the Haihe River and its extended sections ( North Canal and South Canal ), with the main axis along the Haihe and secondary roads radiating from it. The Haihe nightscape has become a major tourist route and has played an important role in events such as the Summer Davos Forum , the 13th National Games , and the SCO Tianjin Summit [ 79 ] .

The following rail lines go through Tianjin: Jingshan Railway (travels from Beijing to Shanhai Pass ) Jinpu Railway (travels from Tianjin to Pukou District , Nanjing ) Jinji Railway (travels from the urban area of Tianjin to Ji County , Tianjin) Jinba Railway (travels from Tianjin to Bazhou , Hebei) Tianjin West railway station The inter-city trains between Beijing and Tianjin will adopt a new numbering system using the letter C (C stands for InterCity) followed by four numbers. The train numbers range between C2001 and C2298. The number ranges are divided into three different groups, which provide information about where a train will go: C2001–C2198: Directly from Beijing South Station to Tianjin C2201–C2268: From Beijing South Station to Tianjin, with stops at Wuqing Station (武清站) C2271–C2298: From Beijing South Station to Yujiapu Railway Station in Tianjin [ 88 ] The new C trains take 30 minutes to travel between Beijing and Tianjin; the trains make the journey with half the time used by the previous D trains. The ticket price, as of Aug 15, 2008, is 69 RMB for first-class seating and 58 RMB for second-class seating. Bus [ edit ] Tianjin Bus Route 678 There were over 900 bus lines in the city as of 2005 [update] . [ 89 ] Roads and expressways [ edit ] Some roads and bridges, such as Minquan Gate and Beiyang Road, have retained names given to them while the Republic of China (1912–1949) was in power. As in other cities in China, some roads in Tianjin are named after Chinese provinces and cities. Unlike Beijing, Tianjin has few roads that run parallel to the four cardinal directions . Tianjin has three ring roads. The Inner and Middle Ring Roads are not closed, traffic-controlled roadways and some often have traffic light intersections. The Outer Ring Road is similar to a highway-level ring road. The road experiences traffic. Inner Ring Road (neihuan) Middle Ring Road (zhonghuan) Outer Ring Road (waihuan) Tianjin's roads often finish in dao (Chinese: 道 ; lit. 'avenue') and xian (simplified Chinese: 线 ; traditional Chinese: 線 ; lit. 'line'). These suffixes are most often used for highways and through routes . The terms lu (Chinese: 路 ; lit. 'road') and j ie (Chinese: 街 ; lit. 'street') are not generally used. As Tianjin's roads are tend to not be in cardinal directions, jing (simplified Chinese: 经 ; traditional Chinese: 經 ; lit. 'avenue') roads and wei (simplified Chinese: 纬 ; traditional Chinese: 緯 ; lit. 'avenue') roads appear; these roads attempt to run more directly north–south and east–west, respectively. The following seven expressways of China run in or through Tianjin: Jingjintang Expressway (travels from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to Tanggu District / TEDA ) Jinghu Expressway (travels from Jinjing Gonglu Bridge to Shanghai; similarly to Jingjintang Expressway , this expressway travels from Beijing to Shanghai) Jingshen Expressway (travels through Baodi District on its way from Beijing to Shenyang ) Tangjin Expressway (travels from Tanggu District , Tianjin, to Tangshan , Hebei — known as the Jintang Expressway in Tianjin) Baojin Expressway (travels from Beichen District , Tianjin, to Baoding , Hebei — known as the Jinbao Expressway in Tianjin) Jinbin Expressway (travels from Zhangguizhuang Bridge to Hujiayuan Bridge; both bridges are in Tianjin) Jinji Expressway (travels from central Tianjin to Jixian County ) The following six China National Highways pass through Tianjin: China National Highway 102 (travels through Ji County, Tianjin on its way from Beijing to Harbin China National Highway 103 (travels from Beijing, through Tianjin's urban area, to Tanggu District ) China National Highway 104 (travels from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to Fuzhou ) China National Highway 105 (travels from Beijing, through Tianjin Municipality, to Macau ) China National Highway 112 (a circular highway around Beijing; passes through Tianjin Municipality) China National Highway 205 (travels from Shanhaiguan , Hebei, through Tianjin Municipality, to Guangzhou ) Religion [ edit ] A Mazu temple in Tianjin Some residents of Tianjin participate in indigenous religious practices , such as the worship of Mazu , a sea goddess. Tianjin also contains the Temple of Great Compassion (a Buddhist temple), St. Joseph's Cathedral (a Catholic cathedral also known as Laoxikai Church), and Our Lady of Victory Church (a Catholic church also known as Wanghailou Church). A Roman Catholic Diocese of Tianjin exists. [ 90 ] According to the Chinese General Social Survey of 2009, Christians constitute 1.51% of the city's population. [ 91 ] Tianjin has been described as a historically "strong center" of Islam in China . [ 92 ] Northwestern Tianjin has traditionally been the location of the Muslim quarter of the city, where Muslims have lived for centuries; the area is near the city's Great Mosque, Qingzhen si , which was founded in 1703. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] The city also contains the Dahuoxiang Mosque.

Tianjin was scheduled to be one of the host cities for the expanded FIFA Club World Cup in 2021 before its cancellation due to the COVID-19 pandemic . It was also scheduled to be one of the host cities for the 2023 AFC Asian Cup before China's withdrawal as the host. Since 2014, a WTA international tennis tournament has taken place in Tianjin every year at the Tuanbo International Tennis Center. Martial arts [ edit ] For some centuries, Tianjin and Beijing had been considered centers for traditional Chinese martial arts. Formerly and currently practiced martial arts including bajiquan , piguazhang , xingyiquan , and baguazhang have been practiced in the city. [ 96 ] [ 97 ] [ 98 ] The martial arts that the city is known most for are Hong Qiao and Nankai. Martial artists practice in public green spaces such as Xigu Park and the Tianjin Water Park .
