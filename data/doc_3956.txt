How to unbolt carburetor from snowblower engine? Ask Question Asked 5 days ago Modified 2 days ago Viewed 338 times 5 Is this a joke? How do I get it off? I just want to clean the parts, and dropping the bowl would probably be sufficient, but the bowl also lacks clearance underneath to come off, so removing the carburetor is apparently the only option.

Unless you've been using "dirty" gas I doubt there is any significant deposits. Does it run fine? If so, I'd leave it alone. If it's not running fine, you might try a non-invasive approach with some carburetor cleaner that you add to the fuel (i.e. avoid "surgery" whenever possible) john-project – john-project 2025-12-25 16:19:52 +00:00 Commented Dec 25 at 16:19 @john-project You're probably right that it's fine. The engine runs but it's been "backfiring" at full throttle lately, so I thought I'd check and clean the needle, etc. Probably in the off season, though. The snowblower is over 15 years old and the gas never gets emptied out of the tank/lines/carb over the summer.. I know I know. But it starts every year, especially with the help of the electric starter for the first run of each season. The cleaning would be maintenance, but I just hope I don't mess up the carb's linkages/settings, so I took pictures. That bolt stopped the project tho. adatum – adatum 2025-12-25 21:28:25 +00:00 Commented Dec 25 at 21:28 3 napaonline.com/en/p/CHTCSDSLPH5 Robert Crovella – Robert Crovella 2025-12-27 00:37:00 +00:00 Commented 2 days ago Add a comment | 3 Answers 3 Sorted by: Reset to default Highest score (default) Date modified (newest first) Date created (oldest first) 5 My suggestion? Use a pair of vice grips to loosen the screw. Yes, this will mar the screw, but it'll help you get it off. Once off, replace them with regular bolts you can remove without issue with a wrench. Just don't over tighten them when putting them in.

Though I would have to find the right hex-head bolts with the right thread pitch to replace them, and who knows where I'll find that. Ultimately, someone got this bolt on here but how??

I'm sure they'd even have someone help you find it. That way you'd never have to deal with the stupidity again.

Whether American SAE or metric, matching threads airways mesh immediately. Mismatched threads simply won't mesh. Parts manuals should list either SAE or metric hardware.

Example: https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005006251835132.html Ideally you want to cut the bit short enough to allows the bolt to come out sufficiently to use your fingers for the rest of it and still get the tool out of the way. You could cut 5/8ths of the 1/4" drive part off (down to the indent) and at the business end I'd leave it as long as possible, and that lets you remove chipped corners in the future. But this solution is massive overkill for a bolt you want to take out and replace with a normal hex-head bolt.

Even if it strips the torx-head, you've lost nothing. Otherwise cut it off with a Dremel-type tool.  As others have said, it should be easy to find a hex-head bolt (or even an Allen head) to replace it with. It does look like a bad joke!
