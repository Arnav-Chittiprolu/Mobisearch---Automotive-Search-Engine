Designed to compete under LMDh regulations, the GMR-001 is set to compete in the FIA World Endurance Championship in the Hypercar category and the IMSA SportsCar Championship in the GTP category starting in 2026 and 2027 respectively. [ 4 ] Rear View History [ edit ] In September 2024, Hyundai announced that they would be launching a LMDh programme under their Genesis luxury car brand with Oreca as the chassis supplier. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Genesis Motor formally unveiled their car at large scale at a launch event in Dubai three months later in December 2024, now known as the GMR-001. [ 4 ] At the event, they announced that their new team, Genesis Magma Racing , would officially enter the FIA World Endurance Championship with the GMR-001 by 2026, followed by an entrance into the IMSA SportsCar Championship the year after. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Team principal Cyril Abiteboul confirmed that the GMR-001 would be using a twin-turbocharged V8 engine and contain a hybrid system. [ 7 ] Alongside the unveiling, former FIA WEC champion André Lotterer and IMSA champion Pipo Derani were confirmed to have joined Genesis in helping develop the GMR-001. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In preparation for the marque's official Hypercar participation, Genesis also confirmed their entry into the 2025 European Le Mans Series with IDEC Sport in LMP2 , competing with an Oreca 07 driven by Jamie Chadwick , and Mathys Jaubert . [ 8 ] Former Formula One driver Logan Sargeant was initially included in the line-up before he "stepped away" from the program prior to the season's commencement. He was replaced by Daniel Juncadella . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Jaubert and Juncadella were later confirmed to be joining Genesis alongside Derani and Lotterer in September 2025. [ 13 ] The car completed its first shakedown test in August 2025 at Circuit Paul Ricard . [ 14 ] [ 15 ] It underwent its first rigorous endurance test a month later in September 2025 at Algarve International Circuit , completing 32 hours of test time with Lotterer, Derani, Jaubert, and Juncadella present at the test.
