The [[Electricity Supply Board|ESB]] eCar electric vehicle charging network serves as the main charging network for the island of Ireland and has rapidly expanded in recent years. Currently the network is free to use with an RFID card provided by ESB to EV owners who wish to use the network. The network aims to provide rapid charging every 30&nbsp;km on major routes and as of 2015 has almost 2000 standard charging points (all provide connection via [[IEC 62196]] Type 2 Mennekes, around half are 22&nbsp;kW with the remainder a mix of 3.6&nbsp;kW and 7.4&nbsp;kW). There are around 100 [[CHAdeMO]] rapid chargers with over 70 located outside the [[Dublin]] Metro area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.esb.ie/ecars/charge-point-map|title=Charge Point Map|website=www.esb.ie}}</ref> All rapid chargers installed since mid-2014 have been triple standard [[CHAdeMO]]/[[Combined Charging System]]/AC 43&nbsp;kW. Four rapid chargers in Dublin and two rapid chargers in Belfast were co-funded by the EU as part of the UK/Ireland RCN program.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rapidchargenetwork.com/resources.php|title=Rapid Charge Network|publisher=Rapid Charge Network|access-date=2015-08-30|archive-date=2015-10-16|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151016202246/http://rapidchargenetwork.com/resources.php|url-status=dead}}</ref> The UK charging network operated by [[Ecotricity#Vehicle recharging|Ecotricity]] has a single [[CHAdeMO]] only rapid charger at IKEA Belfast.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecotricity.co.uk/for-the-road/our-electric-highway|title=Our Electric Highway|access-date=2015-08-30|archive-date=2015-08-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821093113/http://www.ecotricity.co.uk/for-the-road/our-electric-highway|url-status=dead}}</ref> This is the sole rapid charger on the island that is not part of the ESB eCars network.

[[Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland]] offers a government grant of up to €5,000 for the purchase of a new electric car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gas2.org/2010/04/13/ireland-moves-to-ease-switch-to-electric-cars-with-grants-infrastructure/|title=Ireland Moves To Ease Switch To Electric Cars With Grants, Infrastructure|work=Gas 2 |publisher=Gas2.0|date=2010-04-13|access-date=2010-05-17}}</ref> Electric and hybrid vehicles had a reduction of up to {{euro|2,500}} off the registration tax between July 2008 and December 2010.<ref name=ACEA3/> However this grant is only available on vehicles on an approved list of models <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seai.ie/Grants/Electric_Vehicle_Grant_Scheme/I_am_a_consumer/List_of_Eligible_Vehicles/|title=SEAI – List of Eligible Vehicles|access-date=2015-08-30|archive-date=2015-09-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150901051018/http://www.seai.ie/Grants/Electric_Vehicle_Grant_Scheme/I_am_a_consumer/List_of_Eligible_Vehicles|url-status=dead}}</ref> which must be sold by a dealer registered for the scheme.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.seai.ie/Grants/Electric_Vehicle_Grant_Scheme/I_am_a_dealer/Current_List_of_Registered_Dealers/List_of_Registered_Electric_Vehicle_Grant_Scheme_Dealers.html|title=SEAI – List of Registered Electric Vehicle Grant Scheme Dealers|access-date=2015-08-30|archive-date=2015-09-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924095802/http://www.seai.ie/Grants/Electric_Vehicle_Grant_Scheme/I_am_a_dealer/Current_List_of_Registered_Dealers/List_of_Registered_Electric_Vehicle_Grant_Scheme_Dealers.html|url-status=dead}}</ref> No grant applies where a vehicle is imported privately.

{{As of|2014|09}}, plug-in electric car purchasers are eligible for a government credit worth up to {{euro|5,000}} (about {{USD|6,500}}).
