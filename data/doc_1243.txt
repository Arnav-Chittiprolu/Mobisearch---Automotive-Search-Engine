Initially a compact SUV built on a body-on-frame chassis, the second-generation Sorento transitioned to a larger car-based platform which placed it into the mid-size crossover SUV class, [ 1 ] and has been developed alongside the Hyundai Santa Fe . It is presumably named after the Italian city of Sorrento , although Kia did not confirm this.

All US-spec Sorentos also came with dual front airbags and dual side-curtain airbags in the front and rear. An optional four-wheel drive system with low range received praise for adding to the vehicle's off-road ability. It had two transmission options, a 5-speed manual or 4- and 5-speed automatic (pre-2005 models have a 4-speed automatic, whilst 2005 Sorentos came with a 5-speed tip-tronic style automatic). First generation Sorentos are equipped with a Hyundai -manufactured 3.5-litre 24-valve DOHC V6 engine producing 192 hp (143 kW) at 5500 rpm, and 217 lb⋅ft (294 N⋅m) of torque at 3,000 rpm.
Common features of the first generation Sorento were 4-wheel disc brakes (standard on all models), optional anti-lock braking system (ABS), and a 21.1-gallon (79.9 litres) fuel tank. There were two trim levels available for the Sorento: either the base LX or the up-level EX. 2006 facelift [ edit ] Facelift Kia Sorento The 2007 Sorento received upgrades, such as the transition from the 3.5-litre Sigma to the 3.3-litre with 235 hp (175 kW) and 226 lb⋅ft (306 N⋅m), and the 3.8-litre Lambda , with 263 hp (196 kW) and 257 lb⋅ft (348 N⋅m) and increased tow capacity from 3,500 lb (1,588 kg) [ 3 ] to 5,000 lb (2,268 kg). [ clarification needed ] Projector beam headlamps were added, along with new tail lamps. The 5-speed manual transmission was no longer available; the 5-speed Sportmatic tip-tronic automatic transmission was made standard for all vehicles. Most of the EX trim had full-time AWD and 4x4 Low modes; The LX had a part-time system with 2WD High (rear wheel drive), 4WD High (not for dry pavement [ 4 ] ) and 4WD Low modes. The 2007 Kia Sorento earned a five-star crash safety rating, the highest rating possible, for all seating positions in frontal and side impact crash tests conducted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The tail lights and front end were upgraded, but the two-box design stayed.

The second generation was Kia's first model to be manufactured in the United States , in Kia's new US$1 billion West Point, Georgia , factory (which also builds the sister vehicle to the Sorento, the Hyundai Santa Fe ). The second generation used Kia's corporate Tiger Nose grille, and was the first Kia vehicle to offer Kia UVO . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Furthermore, unlike its body-on-frame predecessor, the new Sorento adopted a unibody platform with fully independent suspension. [ 14 ] The vice president of marketing for Kia Motors America said that Kia initially considered changing the name due to the radical change in the Sorento's body style. [ 15 ] The second-generation Sorento introduced Kia's new design language, and introduced new features and technology that would later become available on other Kia models. The four-cylinder model returned to the lineup for North American models after being absent between 2007 and 2010. The engine was transverse, and the suspension all-independent. The change in body construction as well as the loss of a low-ratio transfer case made the Sorento 475 pounds less than the old one model for model, to gain in performance and economy. The second generation Sorento was originally available in four models – the Base, LX, EX and top-of-the-line SX models. The SX is only available with the 3.5-litre 276 hp (206 kW) V6. The Base and LX both come standard with the 2.4-litre straight-4 175 hp (130 kW) and EX has the GDI version of the same engine which is rated 191 hp. The V6 is available as an upgrade for both the LX and EX. The SX Limited model became available in 2012.

[ 24 ] Marketing [ edit ] As part of 2014 Sorento market launch in the US, a campaign titled "It has an answer for everything" was unveiled during Super Bowl XLVII .

After taking it all in, the curious child begins to offer an alternative theory passed on by a friend but his quick-thinking father calls upon UVO's voice-activated jukebox feature to hurriedly change the subject and survive another day in the adventures of parenthood. "Tight Space" (directed by Peter Darley Miller and Colin Jeffery) showed two of the CUV's available features – power-folding mirrors and power liftgate – help a determined father make the slimmest parking garage space manageable while his skeptical wife and children look on.
