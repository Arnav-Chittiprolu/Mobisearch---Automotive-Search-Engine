Help From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This is a tracking category . It is used to build and maintain a list or lists of pages—primarily for the sake of the lists themselves and their use in article and category maintenance. It is not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme . More information: This category is hidden on its member pages —unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. These categories are used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse " (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or subcategories into a larger, more efficient list ( discriminated by classifications ). Typically, tracking categories are automatically populated by templates invoked in pages or by the MediaWiki software (see Special:TrackingCategories for an overview of the latter). Administrators: Please do not delete this category as empty! This category may be empty occasionally or even most of the time. This is a tracking category for CS1 citations that use a value of |volume= longer than four characters and not wholly numeric or uppercase Roman numerals. No error or maintenance message is displayed. No changes are required to remove pages from this category, but some values of |volume= may fit better in other parameters. Pages in this category should only be added by Module:Citation/CS1 .
