From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia South Korean compact car Motor vehicle Hyundai Veloster Overview Manufacturer Hyundai Production 2011–2022 Model years 2012–2022 Assembly South Korea: Ulsan (Ulsan Plant 1) Body and chassis Class Sport compact car Body style 3+1-door hatchback Layout Front-engine, front-wheel-drive Chronology Predecessor Hyundai Tiburon/Coupé/Tuscani The Hyundai Veloster ( Korean : 현대 벨로스터 , romanized : Hyeondae Belloseuteo ) is a compact car which was produced by Hyundai from 2011 until 2022. The car differs from most other hatchbacks with its asymmetrical door configuration, featuring one large door on the driver side and two smaller doors on the passenger side. This configuration is more common on commercial vehicles and minivans . Development and early concepts [ edit ] HND-3 concept (2007) [ edit ] Hyundai HND-3 concept The Hyundai HND-3 concept was the third sport compact concept car styled at Hyundai's Design and Technical Center. It featured a 2.0-liter DOHC Theta inline four-cylinder engine and five-speed automatic transmission. The concept was unveiled at the 2007 Seoul Motor Show , [ 1 ] and evolved into the Veloster, with the final production version released on January 11 at the Detroit Auto Show. The Veloster is developed under the codename FS, and is built on a modified version of the Cee'd's front-wheel drive platform. [ 2 ] First generation (FS; 2011) [ edit ] This article needs to be updated . Please help update this article to reflect recent events or newly available information.

[ citation needed ] A six-speed manual transmission is standard while a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission (DCT) with paddle shifters is available as an option. The DCT transmission was developed by Hyundai and is the first dual-clutch transmission from the company. [ 3 ] Official EPA fuel economy numbers are 27 mpg ‑US (8.7 L/100 km; 32 mpg ‑imp ) city, 37 mpg ‑US (6.4 L/100 km; 44 mpg ‑imp ) highway and 31 mpg ‑US (7.6 L/100 km; 37 mpg ‑imp ) combined for the manual while the dual clutch does 28 mpg ‑US (8.4 L/100 km; 34 mpg ‑imp ) city, 37 mpg ‑US (6.4 L/100 km; 44 mpg ‑imp ) highway and 31 mpg ‑US (7.6 L/100 km; 37 mpg ‑imp ) combined. [ 4 ] For some markets like the Middle East, Chile and Brazil, the car is offered without GDI , making 128 hp. [ 5 ] Sales began in South Korea on March 10, 2011, and in Canada and the United States in late 2011. [ N 1 ] In South Korea, it was marketed under Hyundai's 'Premium Youth Lab'. It was unveiled on January 10, 2011, at the Detroit Auto Show , and fills the void left when Hyundai discontinued the Hyundai Tiburon after the 2008 model year. In North America, the Veloster was equipped with Blue Link , a new telematics system which will eventually be [ needs update ] standard on all Hyundai models. The system is comparable to OnStar in General Motors vehicles, and provides customers with automatic crash notification, vehicle diagnostics, and remote control of vehicle features, among others. Each trim level is available with the DCT (optional) or manual transmission (standard). [ 7 ] A Michelin Pilot Super Sport 215/40ZR18 tires option was added to U.S. vehicle models with 18-inch wheels since 2012. [ 8 ] Interior European models do not have the option of tech or style packs and are instead split between two trim levels: Veloster Coupe and Veloster Coupe Sport. The sport model adds a panoramic sunroof , 18 inch wheels and full leather interior to the base model car. Cars for the European market come as standard with a 6-speed manual transmission and have the option of a DCT automatic gearbox. The range in Europe also includes a "BlueDrive" option, which adds low rolling resistance tires and stop-start technology to the engine in order to reduce emissions, but only on the entry-level car. Unlike the Mini Clubman , which features a pair of bi-parting side doors that are always located on the right of the car (irrespective of the market), the Veloster has different left and right hand drive configurations. The larger single door is always on the driver's side, and the two smaller doors are always on the passenger side. As a result, the rear passenger always exits on the curb side of the vehicle. Veloster Turbo [ edit ] Hyundai Veloster SR Turbo The Veloster Turbo uses a 1.6L T-GDi Gamma engine that has different outputs depending on the market. In North America, the engine outputs 150 kW (204 PS; 201 hp) at 6,000 rpm, and 27 kg⋅m (265 N⋅m; 195 lbf⋅ft) between 1,750 and 4,500 rpm. In other markets, such as Europe, it received a lower-power engine outputting 186 PS (137 kW; 183 hp) at 5,500 rpm with the same 265 Nm of torque, but altered to come earlier in the rev range at 1500 rpm. The car has three doors making the Veloster Turbo's shooting brake body style both in North America and in Europe a relative novelty. The Turbo further receives new body panels which add LED lights, large twin exhausts, side skirts, a larger front grille to accommodate intercooling, turbo badging and extra equipment as standard, including push button start (satnav and back-up camera available on top trim level). The matte grey paint option is also available on the Turbo. The Veloster Turbo was unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show . The model shown was a concept vehicle with a special graphics package featuring a gray and yellow stripe running the length of the car, yellow trim on the front spoiler, side skirts and rear fascia, as well as a checkered flag theme on the side and roof spoiler and was also unveiled at the 2012 Chicago Auto Show . [ 9 ] The North American model went on sale in summer 2012 as a 2013 model year vehicle, [ 10 ] [ N 1 ] with the choice of either a six-speed manual transmission or a six-speed automatic transmission with Shiftronic. [ 11 ] The European version is only available with manual transmission. The Veloster skipped production for 2017, as Hyundai prepared a new model for 2018. Veloster RE:MIX (2012) [ edit ] The Veloster RE:MIX is a version of the Hyundai Veloster inspired by Hyundai's RE:MIX Lab program. It features a unique body kit, gunmetal-finish alloy wheels and a premium audio system. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2012 SEMA show. U.S. models arrived at dealerships in December 2012. [ 12 ] Veloster RE:FLEX Edition (2014) [ edit ] The Veloster RE:FLEX Edition is a limited (3000 units) version of the 2014 Hyundai Veloster 1.6 Gamma GDi with six-speed EcoShift dual-clutch transmission. It features black or red full leather seating, projector headlights with LED headlight accents, LED taillights, LED illuminated door sills, 18-inch alloy wheels with a PVD chrome finish, chrome hood accents, chrome door handles and RE:FLEX badging on the exterior and floor mats. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2014 Chicago Auto Show . U.S. model went on sale for $21,650 excluding freight, and includes all of the Veloster DCT Style Package equipment excluding the panoramic roof. [ 13 ] Veloster Rally Edition (2016) [ edit ] Source: [ 14 ] The Veloster Rally Edition is a limited (1200 Units) version of the 2016 model-year Hyundai Veloster Turbo 1.6 Gamma TCi GDi paired with a 6-speed manual transmission featuring a B&M Sport Shifter assembly. The exterior of the vehicle features a Rally Edition-only matte blue paint color, RAYS Rally Edition wheels (5lbs lighter per wheel), carbon fiber stylized side accents and front-lip, and most noticeably a full-metal roof for weight savings rather than the standard glass panoramic sunroof of the standard Turbo model. The Rally Edition also features a matte-grey front grill sill, like its standard Turbo counterpart of the 2016 model year. The interior of the vehicle is nearly unchanged from the standard Turbo model, with the exception of blue colored interior accents (interior door handles, center console handles, side bolsters). The Rally Edition also comes with Rally Edition floor mats. Compared to the standard Turbo model, the Rally Edition has reduced equipment and lacks: Proximity keyless entry and start, reverse proximity sensors, side mirror indicators, automatic headlights, navigation. In terms of performance, the Rally Edition has no difference in engine performance characteristics to its standard Turbo counterpart. The Rally Edition does feature a retuned suspension, and calibrated driver selectable power-steering (the same as the R-Spec) for stiffer steering response.

The safety recall began on January 22, 2013. [ 33 ] In addition, model year 2012 Veloster vehicles manufactured from July 2, 2011, through February 27, 2012 and equipped with manual transmissions were recalled for binding of parking brake components caused by moisture and road grime. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Motorsports [ edit ] Rhys Millen drove a Veloster rallycross car with a 2-liter engine producing 500 hp (373 kW) and 600 lb⋅ft (813 N⋅m) of torque with a 6-speed sequential transmission and all wheel drive in the Summer X Games during the 2011 US Rallycross Championship Series. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] The partnership between Rhys Millen Racing and Hyundai Motor America continued for the 2012 Global RallyCross Championship season. [ 38 ] After Hyundai had announced it would no longer participate in North American motorsports, the 2011 Hyundai Veloster Global RallyCross race cars went on sale starting January 1, 2013. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] Marketing [ edit ] Hyundai partnered with the Rhys Millen Red Bull Rallycross team in the 2011 U.S.A Rallycross Championship. During the six planned races in 2011, the on-site activity focused on the performance-tuned production vehicles, Genesis Coupe and Veloster, and local brand managers gave attendees tours of the cars and collected attendee data via surveys on buyer interest and brand consideration. Large screens played race footage and rallycross highlights. In the pit area, which was open to all ticket holders, consumers could sit in the vehicles, pick up free merchandise and meet the drivers. The attendee area of the pit was housed in a 53-foot Featherlite spread-axle trailer that the race team operated on one side, while an on-site Hyundai activity area functioned on the other. [ 41 ] A TV commercial titled 'Cheetah', featuring a caged cheetah set to race a new 201 horsepower Veloster Turbo on a long stretch of open road, was premiered during the first quarter of 2012 Super Bowl. [ 42 ] In January 2012, Turn 10 Studios announced on the official Forza Motorsport 4 website that the 2013 Hyundai Veloster Turbo as well as Rhys Millen 's Veloster Rally Car are available as a free downloadable content for the game. [ 43 ] In Brazil the car has been the subject of controversy as Hyundai advertised the GDi injection but only brought the MPI DUAL injection to market. Consumers who pre-ordered the car were forced to accept the non-GDi vehicle without any compensation or cancel the transaction forfeiting the 10% reservation deposit. Despite the fact that the engine is the same 128 hp (95 kW; 130 PS) as the Veloster sold in Chile , the vehicle's license specifies the car as having 138 hp (103 kW; 140 PS). Other advertised options were also not included in the vehicles sold in Brazil. This has led the Brazilian Public Ministry to start investigating Hyundai for fraudulent behavior. [ 44 ] [ 45 ] As part of Hyundai Veloster Zombie Survival Machine premiere, Hyundai also developed a unique configurator app, the WalkingDeadChopShop.com, that allows fans to design a custom zombie survival machine, using the Hyundai Veloster Turbo, Santa Fe or Elantra. The submitted designs would be entered into a contest and the winning design would be constructed and unveiled in October at the New York Comic Con .

[ 48 ] It features a brand new design from the previous generation, still retaining the asymmetrical 2+1 door configuration. It also received new safety equipment as standard on all trims, with forward-collision warning with automated emergency braking, lane-keeping assist, and a driver-attention monitor. All second-generation Velosters got multi-link suspension as standard (previously the non-turbo models from 1st-generation had a coupled torsion rear axle), and Torque Vectoring Control. [ 49 ] The Veloster lineup in the US originally included the base Veloster, the Veloster 2.0 Premium, the Veloster Turbo R-Spec, Veloster Turbo and the Veloster Turbo Ultimate. [ 50 ] The base Veloster and Veloster Premium use a new naturally-aspirated 2.0 L I4 engine that produces 147 hp (110 kW; 149 PS) and 132 lb⋅ft (179 N⋅m) of torque, more powerful than the outgoing naturally-aspirated 1.6 L engine. [ 51 ] Veloster N [ edit ] Veloster N Released in 2019, the Veloster N was the first N model sold in North America. It is powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder engine which initially produced 250 PS (184 kW; 247 hp) as standard, with an optional Performance Package which increased power to 275 PS (202 kW; 271 hp). [ 52 ] In 2021, the Performance Package became standard. It was also initially only offered with a 6-speed manual transmission, but an 8-speed wet dual-clutch transmission was added in 2020. [ 53 ] In April 2020, the Veloster N received a new 8-speed wet dual-clutch transmission, which is claimed to enable the car to accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in 5.6 seconds.

It debuted in September 2019 at IAA (Germany) and was campaigned in the FIA ETCR – eTouring Car World Cup series beginning with that series' inaugural season in 2021 . [ 57 ] It is the first electric racing car built by Hyundai. [ 59 ] The ETCR racer is assembled in Alzenau , Germany alongside other Hyundai N racing vehicles for rally and touring car series. [ 57 ] Design work for the ETCR began in November 2018, and the prototype was first driven in August 2019. [ 59 ] The final drivetrain specification was completed in 2020, and at the launch of the FIA PURE ETCR series in October of that year, Hyundai announced it would campaign the ETCR. A demonstration was held at the Daytona International Speedway during the 2021 Rolex 24 at Daytona . [ 58 ] In 2021, Hyundai driver Jean-Karl Vernay finished second in the PURE ETCR series, while Hyundai finished third (of three contestants) in the manufacturer's standings. [ 60 ] The Veloster N ETCR returned for the second season in 2022 , with the series rebranded to the eTouring Car World Championship. [ 61 ] For 2023, Hyundai plan to race with a Ioniq 6 -based vehicle and its modern E-GMP platform .
