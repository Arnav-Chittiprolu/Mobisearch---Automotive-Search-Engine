The vehicle was unveiled as a concept car at N Day 2022, an event organized by the Hyundai N performance division in mid-July 2022 at Busan , South Korea, alongside the Hyundai RN22e concept based on the Hyundai Ioniq 6 N electric vehicle. The N Vision 74 is a rear-wheel-drive coupe driven by two electric traction motors, both on the rear axle; power is provided by both a storage battery and a hydrogen fuel cell . In December 2023, Hyundai confirmed that the N Vision 74 would be in production with 200 units starting in 2026. History [ edit ] The styling for the N Vision 74 is inspired by the Hyundai Pony Coupe Concept (1974), [ 3 ] [ 4 ] while the underlying technologies were inspired by the N 2025 Vision Gran Turismo (2015). The drivetrain was co-developed with Rimac Automobili and first shown in 2021 fitted to the Kia Stinger -derived Vision FK concept. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Albert Biermann confirmed the roadgoing N Vision 74 prototype was derived from "a [Kia] Stinger [...] The whole idea started with a different brand. It wasn't a [Hyundai] N thing at all, it was for the [Genesis] luxury brand. But then we said this is a lot of complicated stuff so we have to build a mecha-proto – that's what we call a prototype built on an existing car – and then apply the new systems. We realised the Stinger was the closest in terms of size." [ 7 ] Although the 1974 Pony Coupe Concept designed by Giorgetto Giugiaro was a static model when exhibited at the Turin Motor Show , sketches and blueprints were prepared for a production version that never came to fruition, as there was no suitable engine nor was there a business case to bring it to market. [ 8 ] In addition to the production Hyundai Pony, [ 3 ] Italdesign and Giugiaro were responsible for designing similar wedge-shaped sports cars at around the same time, including the BMW M1 and Lotus Esprit . Some of the initial sketches of the N Vision 74 by Hyundai chief of design SangYup Lee were dated to 2016. [ 9 ] N Day 2022 was intended to demonstrate Hyundai N's focus on performance, even as Hyundai incorporates more electric vehicles into its lineup. [ 10 ] Unlike the typical concept car, which are static styling exercises, the N Vision 74 is what Hyundai call a road-capable "Rolling Lab". [ 11 ] A follow-up N Day event was held in September 2022 for the automotive press, which had the opportunity to drive the prototype on the Bilster Berg track in Germany. [ 7 ] In December 2023, it was reported that Hyundai had confirmed plans to produce 100 units of the N Vision 74, with 70 cars sold to public customers and the other 30 reserved for racing. The car will reportedly have around 800 horsepower, and a top speed of 155 mph from the concept model, with production beginning in 2026. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] In August 2024, Hyundai confirmed that production would be underway as part of plans to introduce 21 new models by 2030. [ 14 ] There was some uncertainty reports about if the N Vision 74 would actually go into production, starting in September 2024, when insider news reported that Hyundai reportedly cancelled plans to build the N Vision 74 due to unknown reasons. [ 15 ] In February 2025, Hyundai teased the production spec of the N Vision 74 next to the concept model and other EV's, confirming that the car is scheduled to go into production. [ 16 ] Design and specifications [ edit ] Exterior design is credited to SangYup Lee , [ 17 ] who said "I was even sketching [N Vision 74 ideas] on the plane to Korea, on my way to start at Hyundai. I wanted to create a car that celebrated Hyundai's roots." [ 2 ] The N Vision 74 is equipped with dual electric traction motors (both fitted to the rear axle) with a combined output of 670 hp (500 kW) and 664 lb⋅ft (900 N⋅m) of torque, drawing from a 62.4 kW-hr battery pack and hydrogen tanks storing 4.2 kg (9.3 lb) for an on-board fuel cell. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Peak fuel cell output is 85 kW (114 hp). [ 8 ] Driving each rear wheel with its own traction motor allows torque vectoring . [ 19 ] Hyundai engineers are considering adding a third electric traction motor to the front axle. [ 8 ] To turn Lee's designs into a roadgoing prototype, Hyundai used components from existing vehicles; for example, the fuel cell and hydrogen storage system were taken from the Hyundai Nexo , the electrical system and traction motors are similar to E-GMP vehicles such as the Ioniq 5 and 6 , and portions of the body structure were derived from the Genesis G70 . As driven by Motor Trend at a press event in September 2022, the car was fitted with Pirelli P Zero tires, 270/35R20 front and 315/30R21 rear. [ 2 ] Hyundai claims the car can accelerate to 60 mph (97 km/h) in four seconds [ 19 ] and has a range (including use of the fuel cell as a range-extending auxiliary power unit) of more than 372 mi (599 km) [ 20 ] under the WLTP cycle . [ 10 ] Top speed is more than 250 km/h (160 mph). [ 1 ] Rear view Reception [ edit ] The styling of the N Vision 74 has been praised as blending inspiration from the Lancia 037 and DMC DeLorean with the "Parametric Pixel" design language from the Ioniq family. [ 19 ] Additional commentators have likened the concept vehicle to sports coupes from the 1970s and 1980s, including the Audi Quattro , BMW M1 , Mitsubishi Starion , Nissan Silvia , Toyota AE86 , Toyota Supra , and Volkswagen Scirocco , all members of what Jonny Lieberman said was "the zeitgeist of today's car enthusiast". [ 21 ] Because the car's components are largely derived from production vehicles, the cost of developing a production N Vision 74 could be lowered; Hyundai sources note the N Vision 74 shares the same wheelbase as the Genesis X Speedium Coupe concept and stated they are developing a third concept coupe.
