2026 Honda Accord Update Adds Bigger Screen, Slight Price Bump The 2026 Honda Accord Gets Refreshed With More Stuff, Price Hike Pricing for all Accord trims goes up just a skosh. Kristen Lee Writer Manufacturer Photographer Dec 18, 2025 Seeing as the current, 11th-generation model just debuted in 2023, the refreshed 2026 Honda Accord gets very minor changes, and as a result, prices across all variants go up only slightly. But this update addresses one of our primary complaints about the car, namely its infotainment screen setup on lower trims. While we consider the Accord a leader in the midsize sedan segment, we felt the touchscreens in the base models were too small. Well, clearly Honda has been listening, because all 2026 Accords—meaning the base LX and SE—receive the brand’s 9.0-inch touchscreen as standard, as well as wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto and a wireless phone charger. (Of course, a 9.0-inch screen is still pretty small these days.) Additionally, the Accord SE gets a bigger, 19-inch wheel and tire package that wears a five-spoke design. On the hybrid front, extra black exterior accents mark the 2026 Accord Sport Hybrid. In addition to the black wing mirrors, it now adds gloss-black B-pillar trim, black decklid badging, and a black shark fin antenna to the mix. No upgrades have been made to any of the Accord’s powertrains, so you can expect the same solid mpg as before. The new 2026 Accord pricing structure is as follows: LX 1.5T/CVT - $29,590 ($100 more than 2025) SE 1.5T/CVT - $31,890 ($135 more than 2025) Sport Hybrid - $34,990 ($140 more than 2025) EX-L Hybrid - $36,290 ($155 more than 2025) Sport-L Hybrid - $36,680 ($110 more than 2025) Touring Hybrid - $40,645 ($150 more than 2025) As far as pricing updates go, this one is minimal. The turbocharged LX is still a great deal, and you won’t be asked to pay that much more for the fully loaded 2026 Touring model. The 2026 Honda Accord lineup is making its way to dealerships starting today, December 18. Maybe a late Christmas present? Kristen Lee I got into cars the way most people do: my dad. Since I was little, it was always something we’d talk about and I think he was stoked to have his kid share his interest. He’d buy me the books, magazines, calendars, and diecast models—everything he could do to encourage a young enthusiast. 

Eventually, I went to school and got to the point where people start asking you what you want to do with your life. Seeing as cars are what I love and writing is what I enjoy doing, combining the two was the logical next step. This dream job is the only one I’ve ever wanted. 

Since then, I’ve worked at Road & Track, Jalopnik, Business Insider, The Drive, and now MotorTrend, and made appearances on Jay Leno’s Garage, Good Morning America, The Smoking Tire Podcast, Fusion’s Car vs. America, the Ask a Clean Person podcast, and MotorTrend’s Shift Talkers. 

In my spare time, I enjoy reading, cooking, and watching the Fast & Furious movies on repeat. Tokyo Drift is the best one. Read More Share You May Also Like
