I am adding a {{ reqimage }} tag. N2e ( talk ) 10:33, 24 June 2010 (UTC) [ reply ] It could also very much benefit from a schematic diagram of the connector:  polarity, voltage and current ratings, male and female pins and plugs, etc. N2e ( talk ) 18:24, 10 August 2010 (UTC) [ reply ] It is requested that one or more electromechanical diagrams be included in this article to improve its quality .

Portland station [ edit ] http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/06/north-americas-first-public-use-quick-charge-station-opens-in-p/ Guidod ( talk ) 19:53, 13 August 2010 (UTC) [ reply ] More about DC Charging [ edit ] The article says: Most electric vehicles have on-board rectifiers that transform alternating current from the electrical grid to direct current  suitable for recharging their batteries. Cost and thermal issues limit how much power the rectifier can handle, so beyond around 230 V and 70 Amps it is better for an external charging station  to deliver direct current to the vehicle. Such high voltage high-current charging is referred to as DC Fast Charge and was formerly referred to as level 3 charging.[5] It is not the rectification of AC power that is the issue with on-board fast chargers (that is easy to provide).  What is expensive and heavy to do on-board is the line isolation (required for safety); smoothing of the pulsating DC that comes out of rectifiers (unless the input is 3-phase); and especially the control of the voltage and current to the exacting, variable standards required by the battery as the charge progresses.  Level 3 DC chargers must do all this while obeying control signals from the vehicle's battery management system that request moment by moment the specific voltage and current the battery is capable of accepting.  The protocol for these control signals is as important to a level 3 charger interface specification as is the specification of the plug and jack itself. The SAE is working on a level 3 DC charger interface spec which is not yet ready, and may or may not end up compatible with CHAdeMO (I don't know the details).  If incompatible, this will pose a problem for owners of the thousands of LEAFs that will be hitting the roads this (2010) December, many with the optional CHAdeMO charge jack.  If the eventual U.S. standard is incompatible, will there be a way for these customers to charge from then-standard level 3 DC chargers?  A mere plug and jack difference can be bridged with an adapter, but if the control protocols differ, such an adapter would have to be intelligent.  Differing voltage and current limits may or may not pose another problem to such adaptation. Rgremban ( talk ) 00:54, 15 September 2010 (UTC) [ reply ] DC power limits [ edit ] Under Fast DC Charging the article states "In this style of connection, the charger's DC output has no effective limit, theoretical or practical. " This implies that almost infinite current can be drawn, or near infinite voltage supplied, which is probably not what the writer meant. In any DC connector there has to be a limit in current per connector due to heating through ohmic loses, and there has to be a limit in voltage due to insulation breakdown between connectors.
