The sixth-generation Polo was first unveiled in Berlin on 16 June 2017, and launched in late 2017. [ 8 ] Based on the Volkswagen Group MQB A0 platform , it is claimed to carry improvements in cabin space, engines, and interior technology. [ 9 ] It is the first Polo generation that is not available with a 3-door body style as well as the first passenger vehicle sold under the Volkswagen brand to be based on a shortened version of the MQB platform . [ 10 ] The Mk6 Polo is 81 mm (3.2 in) longer, 63 mm (2.5 in) wider and 7 mm (0.3 in) lower than its predecessor. It has a wheelbase of 2,564 mm (100.9 in), which is 92 mm (3.6 in) longer than the previous model. The adoption of the MQB platform brought an increase in rigidity and stiffness over the previous generation, where the stiffness has increased from 14,000 Nm per degree to more than 18,000 Nm per degree according to Volkswagen. [ 11 ] Boot space has increased by about 25 percent from 280 to 351 L. [ 12 ] Optionally, it now features the second-generation version of the 11.7-inch Active Info Digital Display Cockpit, a first in its class. As standard, the car comes with front collision detection, blind-spot assist, and emergency stopping. The car is said to be extremely customizable, available in 14 exterior colours and 17 dashboard colours. [ 13 ] Production for all right-hand drive markets are allocated to the Volkswagen plant in Uitenhage/Kariega , South Africa. The South African plant is also the sole producer of the Polo GTI. [ 14 ] Rear view Interior Volkswagen Polo R-Line (front view) Volkswagen Polo R-Line (rear view) Markets [ edit ] Europe [ edit ] In Europe, three trim levels were announced during its debut in 2017, which are Trendline, Comfortline and Highline, the ‘Beats’ special edition, and the performance-oriented Polo GTI. [ 15 ] In UK the trim levels in 2017 were SE, SEL, R-Line, GTI and GTI+. [ 16 ] European models initially were available with a range of 1.0-litre, three-cylinder engines with various outputs; 1.0-litre 65 PS (64 hp; 48 kW) and 75 PS (74 hp; 55 kW) naturally aspirated versions, a natural gas-powered 1.0-litre TGI producing 89 PS (88 hp; 65 kW) - as well as 95 PS (94 hp; 70 kW) TSI. The 1.6-litre TDI engine was also available with 80 PS (79 hp; 59 kW) and 95 PS (94 hp; 70 kW) outputs. [ 17 ] The GTI model gets a 200 PS (197 hp; 147 kW) 2.0-litre TSI engine. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Latin America [ edit ] Volkswagen Polo 1.6 MSI Comfortline (Chile) The Latin American-spec Polo debuted in Brazil in September 2017. At the time of its introduction, the Polo was positioned between the Fox and Golf in the Brazilian market, and marks the reintroduction of the nameplate in the country since the discontinuation of the fourth-generation Polo in 2015. [ 20 ] Some changes were made compared to the European version, including a reworked suspension to provide higher ground clearance, a different headlight assembly and a revised front bumper design. [ 21 ] Engine options available are the basic 1.0-litre MPI petrol engine producing 85 PS (84 hp; 63 kW), 1.6-litre MSI rated at 119 PS (117 hp; 88 kW), and the top-spec 1.0-litre TSI with 130 PS (128 hp; 96 kW) marketed as '200 TSI', referencing its 200 N⋅m (20.4 kg⋅m; 148 lb⋅ft) maximum torque. [ 22 ] In early 2020, the GTS variant was launched in Brazil, featuring a 150 PS (148 hp; 110 kW) 1.4-litre turbocharged petrol engine and cosmetic additions. [ 23 ] In Mexico, the Brazilian-imported, facelifted Polo was released in 2023, six years after the Brazilian model's launch, sharing the same engines and specification with the Virtus saloon. It replaced the Indian-made Polo Mk5. [ 24 ] Polo Track [ edit ] Announced in November 2022 as a replacement for the Gol , the Polo Track was released in February 2023 as a low-cost version of the Mk6 Polo. Aimed at fleet buyers, the Track version has a shorter list of features and a simpler exterior appearance. [ 25 ] It is powered by a 1.0-litre MPI (1.6-litre 16V MSI 105 hp for Colombia and other countries) petrol flex engine producing 85 PS (84 hp; 63 kW).

Latin NCAP noted that since the original test, the car had lost a manual passenger airbag disconnection switch that allows for safe installation of a rearward-facing child restraint on the front passenger seat. 2017 Volkswagen Polo Mk6 Latin NCAP 3.0 scores (2022, similar to Euro NCAP 2014) [ 31 ] Overall Adult occupant 73% Child occupant 71% Pedestrian and vulnerable road users 51% Safety assist systems 58% Facelift [ edit ] In April 2021, the restyled version of the sixth-generation Polo was revealed for the European market, known colloquially as the MK7. It gained a redesigned front end, featuring reshaped headlights and an LED light bar on the grille. A matrix LED setup is optional for the first time in a Polo. The rear end now adopts wider LED taillights extending onto the tailgate. With the facelifted version, the Polo comes with a fully digital instrument cluster as standard. The dashboard also received a redesigned touch climate control. [ 32 ] For the Latin American market, the facelifted 2023 Polo does not receive the taillight shape redesign. [ 33 ] 2021 Volkswagen Polo (facelift) 2021 Volkswagen Polo (facelift) Virtus [ edit ] Main article: Volkswagen Virtus Volkswagen developed the sixth-generation Polo in a saloon body style badged as the Volkswagen Virtus , which is produced in Brazil and exported to most Latin American countries. It is also produced in India since 2022. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] It is marketed as the Polo Sedan in South Africa since September 2022. [ 36 ] Volkswagen Virtus (Brazil) Rear view Other versions [ edit ] Polo liftback (Russia) [ edit ] Main article: Volkswagen Polo (CK) In Russia and the neighbouring CIS countries, a separate Polo model was released in 2020 to replace the Polo Mk5 saloon. Unrelated to the Mk6 Polo, the model heavily based on the global Škoda Rapid liftback to cut costs instead of having to produce the MQB A0 -based Volkswagen Virtus. The Russian-market Polo features a Jetta-like front fascia, and a unique rear fascia to differentiate it from the Rapid, while sharing the front bumper and hood panel with the Jetta VA3 . [ 37 ] As it is based on the Rapid, it is based the A05+ (PQ25) platform and has a liftback tailgate instead of a conventional saloon trunk opening. It is offered with a 1.6-litre MPI four-cylinder, naturally aspirated engine with 89 hp (90 PS; 66 kW) with a five-speed automatic gearbox, and 109 hp (111 PS; 81 kW) also with a six-speed automatic transmission, and a 1.4-litre TSI four-cylinder with 123 hp (125 PS; 92 kW), only with a seven-speed DSG dual-clutch transmission. [ 37 ] In early 2022, Volkswagen ceased production and new car sales of the global Skoda Rapid liftback-based CIS Volkswagen Polo, due to international sanctions being imposed on Russia as a result of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine .
