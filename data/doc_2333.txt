It is one of the classes of offshore powerboat racing . The earliest recorded race was held in 1887 in Nice , France, organized by the Paris Sailing Club. The next two recorded races were in 1903 in France, a 62-mile race in Meulan on the River Seine organized by the Poissy Sailing Club, and a 230-mile race from Paris to Trouville. [ citation needed ] Offshore powerboat racing developed into its modern form following the first Miami–Nassau race in 1956, which preceded the creation of the Sam Griffith Memorial Trophy and the establishment of a UIM-sanctioned Class 1 World Championship in 1964. [ 1 ] From 1964 to 1976 the championship used a multi-race points system; from 1977 to 1991 it was decided at a single end-of-season event. A multi-event format was reinstated in 1992. [ 1 ] As of the 2019 season, a Class One USA category was introduced within the APBA Offshore Championship Series, with catamarans using twin 9.0-litre Mercury Racing 1100 Competition V8 stern drive engines as a spec power unit. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] [ 4 ] In the inaugural 2019 Class One USA championship, the Dubai-based Victory Team (Victory 3, crewed by Salem Al Adidi and Eisa Al Ali) secured the overall title at the Roar Offshore Fort Myers event, winning the APBA Offshore Championship Series crown. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] History [ edit ] Offshore powerboat racing expanded following the Miami–Nassau race in 1956, which led to the introduction of the Sam Griffith Memorial Trophy and, in 1964, a UIM-sanctioned offshore World Championship for Class 1 boats. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] From 1964 through 1976, the World Championship title was decided by cumulative points over the course of multiple races, which were held at venues around the world. [ 7 ] From 1977 to 1991, the title was decided by a single end-of-season event, which itself comprised a series of races. In 1992, the championship title reverted back to the multi-event format. [ 7 ] Class 1 Grand Prix Dubai 2012 Class 1 Boats [ edit ] Class 1 offshore race boats are catamarans , measuring between 12 and 14 meters (40–45 ft.) in length and 3.5 meters (11.5 ft.) in beam. They are constructed from composite materials such as carbon fiber, Kevlar, which are commonly used in high-performance marine applications to achieve a balance between structural strength and weight. [ 9 ] Under current regulations, Class 1 catamarans must meet a minimum weight of 4,950 kg (about 5 tons). [ 10 ] All competing boats use twin Mercury Racing 9.0-litre 1100 Competition V8 sterndrive engines as the mandatory spec power unit, producing a combined output of 2,200 horsepower. [ 11 ] These engines allow Class 1 boats to exceed speeds of 257 km/h (160 mph) in optimal conditions. [ 10 ] The cockpit incorporates reinforced crash structures designed to protect the crew during high-speed impacts and is fitted with safety features such as canopies, impact-resistant seating, and an escape hatch in the hull. Onboard instrumentation typically includes GPS navigation, trim indicators, and engine management displays, used by the crew to monitor performance during competition. [ 9 ] Two crew members operate a Class 1 race boat: a driver and a throttle man. The driver is responsible for steering the boat and selecting the racing line, while the throttleman manages engine power, trim settings, and balance to optimize performance in varying sea conditions. Both members wear specialized safety equipment, including impact-resistant helmets, flotation devices, and harness systems compliant with offshore racing regulations. Safety protocols require crews to complete approved training and demonstrate familiarity with emergency procedures before competition. [ citation needed ] The Championship [ edit ] A Class 1 season consists of a series Grands Prix, made up of three official practice sessions, one official qualifying session (which is also known as Pole Position), and two races. The results of each race are combined to determine the winner of the World Championship. The European Championship and the Middle East Championship are defined by specific events in those geographic regions. The results in official qualifying determine the winner of the Pole Position Championship. Eight races at four venues make up the UIM Class 1 World Powerboat Championship , with races run over approximately 55 or 75 nautical miles (Nm) of multiple laps of approximately 5 Nm (including one or two mandatory long laps). [ citation needed ] The World Championship is awarded to the team with the most accumulated points throughout the season. A winning crew collects 20 points, the runners-up 15, with the third-placed team awarded 12 points. [ citation needed ] [ citation needed ] A Grand Prix weekend is run over three days, with registration, technical scrutineering, the first practice session and driver briefings taking place on day one. [ 12 ] On day two, a practice session is run in the morning, followed immediately by the Edox Pole Position (qualifying), also counting as a separate championship, and Race 1 in the afternoon. [ 13 ] The Edox Pole Position session, like the practice sessions, is held on the Grand Prix course. It allows teams to assess circuit conditions and make technical adjustments to their boat setup. It acts as the qualifier for the line-up for Race 1, with the Pole-sitter (fastest time) lining-up closest to the official start boat. The Edox Pole Position lasts for 45 minutes, with teams having to complete a minimum of one timed lap and allowed to return to the wet pits to make adjustments to set-up, but limited to a total of 10 minutes under the crane. [ 14 ] On day three, a final practice session in the morning is followed in the afternoon by Race 2. Each race is started by a Nor-Tech 3600 Supercat official pace boat, running at a controlled speed, which lead the boats from the wet pits and into a line-abreast under a yellow flag or amber flashing light, a green flag denoting the race start, with the finishing order of the Edox Pole Position dictating the line-up of the boats for Race 1 and the finishing order of Race 1, the start order for Race 2. [ 15 ] Each race consists of approximately 11–15 laps and is 55–75 Nm in length, including one or two mandatory long laps.
