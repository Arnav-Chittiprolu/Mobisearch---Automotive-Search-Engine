It is geographically located in European Russia and is administratively part of the Central Federal District , covering an area of 25,700 square kilometers (9,900 sq mi). It has a population of 1,553,925 ( 2010 census ) . [ 4 ] Tula is the largest city and the administrative center of the oblast. Tula Oblast borders Moscow Oblast in the north, Ryazan in the east, Lipetsk in the southeast, Oryol in the southwest, and Kaluga in the west. Tula Oblast is one of the most developed and urbanized territories in Russia, and the majority of the territory forms the Tula- Novomoskovsk Agglomeration, an urban area with a population of over 1 million. History [ edit ] See also: Upper Oka Principalities The Tula Oblast area has been inhabited since the Stone Age , as shown by the discoveries of burial mounds ( kurgans ) and old settlements. [ 5 ] By the eighth century, these lands were occupied by the Vyatichi , an East Slavic tribe who cultivated the land, traded, and worked at crafts, confirmed by records in property registers which mention an "ancient settlement" located at the confluence of the Upa River and Tulitsa River. The first mention of the city of Tula in 1146 is found in the Nikon Chronicle , in reference to the campaign of Prince Svyatoslav Olgovich of Chernigov . At the time the lands belonged to the Ryazan Principality , and Prince Sviatoslav passed through a number of settlements, including Tula, while heading for Ryazan . [ 6 ] Geography [ edit ] Tula Oblast is located in Russia's Central Federal District and borders Moscow , Ryazan , Lipetsk , Oryol , and Kaluga Oblasts . Rivers [ edit ] Tula Oblast contains more than 1,600 rivers and streams.  Major rivers include: Don River Oka River Upa River Natural resources [ edit ] The oblast is rich in iron ore , clay , limestone , and deposits of lignite (coal).

Annual precipitation is 470 millimetres (19 in) in the southeast and 575 millimetres (22.6 in) in the northwest. Politics [ edit ] Oblast administration building During the Soviet period, the high authority in the oblast was shared between three persons: The first secretary of the Tula CPSU Committee (who in reality had the biggest authority), the chairman of the oblast Soviet (legislative power), and the Chairman of the oblast Executive Committee (executive power). Since 1991, CPSU lost all the power, and the head of the Oblast administration, and eventually the governor was appointed/elected alongside elected regional parliament . The Charter of Tula Oblast is the fundamental law of the region. The Tula Oblast Duma is the province's standing legislative (representative) body. The Oblast Duma exercises its authority by passing laws, resolutions, and other legal acts and by supervising the implementation and observance of the laws and other legal acts passed by it. The highest executive body is the Oblast Government, which includes territorial executive bodies such as district administrations, committees, and commissions that facilitate development and run the day to day matters of the province. The Oblast administration supports the activities of the Governor who is the highest official and acts as guarantor of the observance of the oblast Charter in accordance with the Constitution of Russia . Local government [ edit ] Representative bodies of urban and rural settlements and urban districts consist of deputies elected in municipal elections. The representative body of the municipal district consists of the heads of settlements that are part of the municipal district, and of deputies of the representative bodies of these settlements, elected by the representative bodies of the settlements from among their members in accordance with the same norm of representation, regardless of the population of the settlement. The term of office of representative bodies of cities, rural settlements, city districts, and municipal districts is 5 years, with some exceptions when the term is 3 years. [ 8 ] Local government bodies in the Tula Oblast are headed by 103 heads of municipalities and 84 heads of municipal administrations. [ 9 ] In accordance with the regional law of 2017, village elders carry out activities to organize interaction between local government bodies and residents of rural settlements when resolving issues of local importance. [ 10 ] As of 1 November 2022, 1,071 village elders operate in 23 municipal districts and urban districts. Their powers extend to the territory of more than 1,700 settlements, home to about 160,000 inhabitants. [ 9 ] In the Tula Oblast, regional branches of dozens of political parties are registered, the largest in terms of membership being United Russia , the Communist Party of the Russian Federation (CPRF), the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia (LDPR), Patriots of Russia , the Party of Growth , A Just Russia – For Truth , Yabloko , and the Party of Pensioners of Russia .
