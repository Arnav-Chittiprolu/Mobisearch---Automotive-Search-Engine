Beginning in 1920, GMC and Chevrolet trucks became largely similar, built as variants of the same [[car platform|platform]], sharing much the same body sheetwork, except for nameplates and grilles – though their differences, especially engines, have varied over the years. GMC advertising marketed its trucks to commercial buyers and businesses, whereas Chevrolet's advertising was directed towards private owners.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}} Beginning in 1928, GMCs used [[Pontiac straight-6 engine#186|Pontiac's 186&nbsp;cu&nbsp;in]] six-cylinder engines in their lighter trucks.<ref name=PW28>{{cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ObM3AAAAMAAJ&pg=PA65 | journal = Power Wagon | volume = XL | number = 277 | date = January 1928 | page = 64 | editor-first = Austin W. | editor-last = Stromberg | title = New GMC Six Has Pontiac Engine }}</ref> Medium-duty trucks relied on [[Oldsmobile straight-6 engine]]s, while the heaviest trucks used GMC's own "Standard Big Brute" engine.<ref name=PW28/> From 1939 to 1974, GMC had its own line of [[GMC straight-6 engine|six-cylinder engines]], first the inline sixes known as "Jimmy's" from 1939 to 1959, and then their own [[GMC V6 engine|V6]] from 1960 until 1974, of which a V8 and a V12 version also existed. Additionally, from 1955 through 1959, the less than 2-ton, domestic GMC gasoline trucks were equipped with [[Pontiac V8 engine|Pontiac V8]]s, and [[Oldsmobile V8 engine|Oldsmobile V8]]s—whereas the Canadian models used Chevrolet engines.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}} GMC dealerships were partnered with Pontiac, Oldsmobile and Buick dealerships.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

Between 1962 and 1972, most GMC vehicles were equipped with quad-headlights, while their Chevrolet clones were equipped with dual-headlights. The platform has been the most profitable for General Motors, as it was shared with the [[Chevrolet Blazer]]/[[GMC Jimmy]], the [[Chevrolet Suburban]] and the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]]/[[GMC Denali]]. In 1998, the platform was introduced as the [[Cadillac Escalade]].

In 1971, GMC marketed their version of the [[Chevrolet El Camino]], which was based on the [[Chevrolet Chevelle]]. Called [[GMC Sprint / Caballero|Sprint]], it was virtually identical to the El Camino, and a sport version, the SP, was equivalent to the El Camino SS. It was renamed Caballero in 1978, and remained produced alongside the El Camino until its demise in 1987.

In 1973, with GM's introduction of the new "rounded line" series trucks, GMC and Chevrolet trucks became even more similar, ending production of GMC's quad-headlight models, and setting the standard for the Chevrolet/GMC line of trucks for over thirty years.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}}

{{As of|2020}}, GMC's vehicles were marketed as more premium, [[luxury vehicles]] positioned above similar vehicles from the more mainstream [[Chevrolet]] division. Chevrolet vehicles are priced lower than a comparable GMC, but GMC vehicles have features not found in a comparable Chevrolet.<ref>{{Cite magazine |last=Hemer |first=Chris |date=November 28, 2019 |title=First Look: 2020 GMC Sierra HD |url=https://www.trailerlife.com/towing/tow-vehicles/first-look-2020-gmc-sierra-hd/ |magazine=Trailer Life |language=en-US}}</ref>

In [[North America]], Chevrolet offers a full lineup of [[car]]s, [[Crossover (automobile)|crossover vehicles]], [[sport utility vehicle]]s, and [[pickup truck]]s. GMC, however, does not offer any car models, so typically they are sold along [[Buick]] (or sometimes [[Cadillac]]) vehicles at multi-brand [[Car dealerships in the United States|dealerships]], allowing the same dealer to sell a full lineup of upscale vehicles, including both cars and trucks. However some standalone GMC dealerships do exist, primarily for dealers who have a focus on selling to the [[Commercial vehicle|commercial]] and [[fleet vehicle]] markets.
