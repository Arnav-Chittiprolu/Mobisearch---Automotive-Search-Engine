Do not fill this in! == Comparison of dynamic and regenerative brakes ==
[[File:NSLocoNo.5348.jpg|thumb|The box extending sideways from the roof directly over the word "operation" allows air to freely flow through the resistors of the dynamic brakes on this diesel-electric locomotive.]]
What are described as dynamic brakes ("[[rheostatic brake]]s" in British English) on electric traction systems, unlike regenerative brakes, dissipate electric energy as heat rather than using it, by passing the current through large banks of [[resistor]]s. Vehicles that use dynamic brakes include [[forklift truck]]s, [[Diesel-electric transmission|diesel-electric]] [[locomotive]]s, and [[tram]]s. This heat can be used to warm the vehicle interior, or dissipated externally by large [[radiator]]-like cowls to house the resistor banks.

General Electric's experimental 1936 [[GE steam turbine locomotives|steam turbine locomotives]] featured true regeneration. These two locomotives ran the steam water over the resistor packs, as opposed to air cooling used in most dynamic brakes. This energy displaced the oil normally burned to keep the water hot, and thereby recovered energy that could be used to accelerate again.<ref>{{cite book |first= Brian |last= Solomon |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTRcBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA59 |title= GE and EMD Locomotives |publisher=Voyageur Press |year=2014 |pages=59–61|isbn= 9781627883979 }}</ref>

The main disadvantage of regenerative brakes when compared with dynamic brakes is the need to closely match the generated current with the supply characteristics and increased maintenance cost of the lines. With DC supplies, this requires that the voltage be closely controlled. The AC power supply and frequency converter pioneer Miro Zorič and his first AC power electronics have also enabled this to be possible with AC supplies.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The supply frequency must also be matched (this mainly applies to locomotives where an AC supply is [[rectifier|rectified]] for DC motors).

In areas where there is a constant need for power unrelated to moving the vehicle, such as electric train heat or [[air conditioning]], this load requirement can be utilized as a sink for the recovered energy via modern [[Variable-frequency drive|AC traction systems]]. This method has become popular with North American passenger railroads where [[head end power]] loads are typically in the area of 500&nbsp;kW year round. Using HEP loads in this way has prompted recent electric locomotive designs such as the [[ALP-46]] and [[ACS-64]] to eliminate the use of dynamic brake resistor grids and also eliminates any need for any external power infrastructure to accommodate power recovery allowing self-powered vehicles to employ regenerative braking as well.

A small number of [[steep grade railway]]s have used [[three-phase|3-phase]] power supplies and [[induction motor]]s. This results in a near constant speed for all trains, as the motors rotate with the supply frequency both when driving and braking.
