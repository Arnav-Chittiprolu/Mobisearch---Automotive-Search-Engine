[ 2 ] The team competes in the NASCAR Cup Series where they currently field three Toyota Camry teams: the No. 42 full-time for John Hunter Nemechek , the No. 43 full-time for Erik Jones , and the No. 84 part-time for team co-owner Johnson. The team has a technical alliance with Toyota Racing Development . [ 3 ] In 2024, Legacy Motor Club competed in the electric off-road racing series Extreme E . [ 4 ] History [ edit ] The team was known as Petty GMS Motorsports from December 2021 to January 2023 On December 1, 2021, Maury Gallagher purchased a majority interest in the former Richard Petty Motorsports for US$ 19 million. The deal included both of RPM's charters; the No. 43 continued to operate with its charter while the second charter - which was leased to Rick Ware Racing for the No. 51 from 2019 to 2021 - was transferred to a second car for the team, the No. 42. [ 5 ] Following the purchase, the team was renamed to Petty GMS Motorsports. On September 16, 2022, it was reported that Petty GMS Motorsports would use Joe Gibbs Racing pit crews in 2023. [ 6 ] On November 4, seven-time NASCAR champion Jimmie Johnson purchased an ownership stake in Petty GMS. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Following the 2022 season, Richard Petty sold all shares of Petty GMS Motorsports to majority owner Gallagher. [ 9 ] Logo of Legacy Motor Club used from 2023 to 2024. On January 11, 2023, the team announced the rebranding of the organization to Legacy Motor Club, marking the first time since the founding of NASCAR in 1949 that the Petty family has not had their name on a team in NASCAR's top series. [ 10 ] On February 18, Petty announced that Johnson had taken control of the team's day-to-day operations, leaving him without decision-making power. [ 11 ] On May 3, the team announced it will switch manufacturers from Chevrolet to Toyota in 2024. [ 3 ] On July 26, Cal Wells was appointed as the team's CEO . [ 12 ] On August 25, Bill Scott was promoted from Executive Vice President & General Counsel to COO . [ 13 ] On October 10, Matt Kenseth was named the team’s Competition Advisor. [ 14 ] On January 25, 2024, Trevor Bayne was named the team's Competition Advisor. [ 15 ] On July 14, Bobby Kennedy was named General Manager, while Competition Director Joey Cohen left the team. [ 16 ] On January 27, 2025, Johnson was named majority owner of Legacy Motor Club, with Knighthead Capital Management purchasing a minority stake and Gallagher stepping back into an ambassador role. [ 17 ] Lawsuit against Rick Ware Racing [ edit ] On April 1, 2025, LMC sued Rick Ware Racing over the sale of a charter. On March 3, both teams signed a deal for RWR to sell a charter to LMC, but RWR has allegedly backed out on the deal. RWR claims the agreement would go in effect in 2027, but LMC changed the terms to 2026 without any communication with RWR. [ 18 ] On April 9, LMC obtained a temporary restraining order preventing RWR from selling, leasing, or otherwise encumbering the charter in question for at least 10 days or until agreement by LMC and RWR. However, a North Carolina judge denied LMC the injunction. It was revealed that the lawsuit resulted from a confusion over which of RWR's two charters was in the transaction. The agreement stated Charter 36 (currently used by the No. 51 car) was to be sold for US$ 45 million; LMC's attorney argued that the contract listed Charter 27 (which was leased to RFK Racing for the No. 60 car in 2025 ). RWR's attorney claimed that two weeks after the agreement was signed, LMC offered to pay RWR an additional US$ 5 million for Charter 27 for 2026. RFK has an agreement to lease Charter 36 in 2026, as teams are allowed to lease charters once every seven years. [ 18 ] On June 18, RWR filed a countersuit against LMC, citing LMC made a false claim of purchasing the charter for 2026. [ 19 ] On July 14, The courts granted LMC permission to depose RWR following the recent revelation that T.J. Puchyr intends to purchase RWR. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] On July 16, LMC filed a lawsuit against Puchyr for tortious interference, alleging that he attempted to purchase RWR and violated the state’s Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act by using insider knowledge and a position of trust to interfere with Legacy’s agreement with RWR. [ 22 ] On July 31, a judge granted LMC a temporary restraining order against RWR, preventing RWR from closing the team's sale to Puchyr for ten days. [ 23 ] On September 19, 2025, it was announced that LMC and RWR ended their lawsuit under a settlement, with RWR selling the charter to LMC; the rest of their settlement agreement is still unknown. [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Cup Series [ edit ] Car No. 42 history [ edit ] Further information: Petty Enterprises § Car No. 42 history Ty Dillon (2022) Ty Dillon in the No. 42 at Auto Club Speedway in 2022 On June 17, 2021, Gallagher announced that GMS Racing would move up to the NASCAR Cup Series in 2022. [ 26 ] On October 10, GMS announced that Ty Dillon would drive the then-No. 94 in their inaugural Cup season. [ 27 ] On December 1, Gallagher purchased a majority interest in Richard Petty Motorsports for US$ 19 million. The deal included both of RPM's charters; the No. 43 would continue to operate with its charter while the second charter - which was leased to Rick Ware Racing for the No. 51 from 2019 to 2021 - would be transferred to GMS' entry which was re-numbered from 94 to No. 42. [ 28 ] Dillon began the 2022 season with an eleventh place finish at the 2022 Daytona 500 . Throughout the season, he only scored a top-ten finish at the Bristol dirt race . On July 15, Dillon announced that he would part ways with Petty GMS at the end of the 2022 season. [ 29 ] Prior to the Pocono race , the No. 42 was docked 35 driver and owner points for an L1 penalty when the pre-race inspection revealed issues on the car's rocker box vent hole. [ 30 ] At Kansas , the No. 42 began to use pit crew members from Joe Gibbs Racing ; both the No. 42 and No. 43 will use JGR pit crew members starting in 2023.

[ 33 ] [ 34 ] Gragson started the season with a 24th-place finish at the 2023 Daytona 500 . Shortly after finishing 29th at Kansas , he confronted Ross Chastain over a racing incident between them that resulted in Gragson hitting the outside wall. Gragson shoved Chastain, who retaliated with a punch to the face. [ 35 ] At Gateway , Gragson was involved in a hard crash due to a brake rotor failure. His car spun down toward the apron and then back up the track, hitting the wall first with the rear of his car and then the front. Gragson suffered concussion-like symptoms from the crash and was replaced by Grant Enfinger at Sonoma . [ 36 ] Enfinger finished 26th. [ 37 ] On August 5, NASCAR and LMC suspended Gragson indefinitely for violation of Section 4.4.D. of the NASCAR Rule Book, which concerns member conduct, after Gragson liked an offensive meme related to the murder of George Floyd on social media. [ 38 ] Josh Berry replaced Gragson at Michigan , where he finished 34th after a hard crash in Turn 4 on lap 51. [ 39 ] Mike Rockenfeller drove the No. 42 to a 24th-place finish at Indianapolis , a 19th at Watkins Glen , [ 40 ] and a 29th at the Charlotte Roval . [ 41 ] On August 10, Gragson requested to be released from his contract with LMC so he can focus on the reinstatement process. [ 42 ] Carson Hocevar drove the No. 42 to a seventeenth place finish at Darlington . [ 43 ] Hocevar finished twentieth at Kansas , earning the No. 42’s first back-to-back top-twenty finishes since Atlanta and COTA . A week later, he scored a career-best eleventh place finish at the Bristol night race . [ 44 ] On October 4, Hocevar was signed for the final four races. [ 45 ] On October 16, LMC announced that John Hunter Nemechek would drive the No. 42 at Homestead instead of Hocevar, with Hocevar still running the final two races. [ 46 ] Nemechek finished 32nd after being involved in a crash on Lap 222. [ 47 ] The No. 42 team ended the season 32nd in the owners’ standings.

[ 52 ] When GMS bought Richard Petty Motorsports in 2021, Jones was retained to drive the 43 car. Jones began the 2022 season with a 29th-place finish at the 2022 Daytona 500 . He scored thirteen top-ten finishes during the season, including a third-place finish at Fontana and a fourth-place finish at Atlanta . Prior to the Pocono race , the No. 43 was docked 35 driver and owner points for an L1 penalty when the pre-race inspection revealed issues on the car's rocker box vent hole. [ 30 ] Jones was signed to a multi-year agreement on July 30. [ 53 ] Despite not making the playoffs, he won at Darlington , giving Petty GMS its first win. In addition, he gave the No. 43 its first win since the 2014 Coke Zero 400 and its overall 200th win. [ 54 ] Jones ended the season eighteenth in the points standings.

[ 57 ] On June 7, following an eighteenth place finish at the Gateway race, NASCAR gave the No. 43 an L1 penalty after a post-race inspection revealed illegal modifications to the car's greenhouse. As a result, the team was docked sixty driver and owner points and five playoff points. In addition, crew chief Dave Elenz was fined US$ 75,000 and suspended for two races. [ 58 ] After a 32nd place finish at Sonoma , Jones finished sixteenth or better in the next five consecutive races, including an eighth place finish at Nashville and a ninth place finish at Pocono .

The number is an inverse of Johnson's famous 48 car (still run by Johnson's long-time team Hendrick Motorsports ). Johnson also chose the number due to him having 83 wins, and his goal to get one more, which would tie him with Bobby Allison and Darrell Waltrip for fourth all time. On February 14, Johnson made the entry field by scoring the fastest lap among the non-chartered teams. [ 65 ] He would finish 31st after wrecking out in the first overtime attempt on Lap 203.
