Introduced in the mid-2020s as part of Cadillac’s transition to an all-electric future, the Escalade IQ was developed to bring the scale, comfort, and presence of the traditional Escalade into the EV era, while competing with emerging ultra-luxury electric SUVs. Built on General Motors’ Ultium electric vehicle platform, the Escalade IQ emphasizes advanced technology, long-range capability, and high-end materials, positioning it as a cornerstone of Cadillac’s modern electric brand identity. The vehicle is produced at GM’s Factory Zero assembly plant in Detroit, Michigan . Development and specifications [ edit ] GM first announced the Cadillac Escalade IQ in May 2023 as a battery-electric version of the full-size sport utility vehicle . [ 2 ] Details were released at a New York City press event on August 9, 2023. The Escalade IQ began production at Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly in late 2024 for the 2025 model year. [ 3 ] A variant with an extended wheelbase, known as the Escalade IQL, has been released in 2025 to correspond to the Escalade ESV. [ 4 ] GM previously had trademarked the names "Escalade IQ" and "Escalade IQL" in 2021. [ 5 ] The Escalade IQ/IQL is the first electric Cadillac intended to replace an existing model powered by internal combustion engines. [ 6 ] The Escalade IQ is based on GM's Ultium technology, sharing batteries, motors, and other components with the GMC Hummer EV , Chevrolet Silverado EV , and Cruise Origin . The 24-module battery has a storage capacity of more than 200 kW-hr, giving it a claimed estimated driving range of 450 mi (720 km). [ 6 ] Peak charging rate is 350 kW using an 800 V DC source; there is an onboard AC charger with a maximum input capacity of 19.2 kW. [ 7 ] At launch, the dual-motor, all-wheel-drive Escalade IQ will be equipped with two output modes: the standard output mode peaks at a combined 680 hp (510 kW; 690 PS) and 615 lb⋅ft (834 N⋅m) of torque, while "Velocity Max" increases output to 750 hp (560 kW; 760 PS) and 785 lb⋅ft (1,064 N⋅m) of torque. [ 8 ] The rear wheels are linked to the steering wheel, turning up to 10 degrees either opposite (at low speeds) or in the same direction as the front wheels (at highway speeds) and permitting diagonal travel similar to the Hummer EV's "crabwalk" mode.
