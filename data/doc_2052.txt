[ citation needed ] The vehicle is built upon the M3 platform, designated towards mid-size luxury vehicles that use a rear - or all-wheel drive basis. [ 20 ] Development and launch [ edit ] The RG3 G80 was officially revealed via an online livestream on March 30, 2020, and went on sale in the US during the summer of that year. [ 21 ] It is also considered the third-generation model of the original Hyundai Genesis as the first-generation G80 model was initially launched as the second-generation Hyundai Genesis model ( DH ) and later rebranded as the G80 in 2016 after Genesis Motor became a separate luxury division of Hyundai. [ 22 ] There are three engine options – a 2.5-liter gasoline turbo engine, a 3.5-liter gasoline turbo engine, or a 2.2-liter diesel engine. [ 23 ] The brand claims 19 percent of the new platform uses aluminum, saving 243 lb (110 kg) compared to the previous model which used steel. Compared to the outgoing G80, the new model has increased tensile strength by 6 percent due to the usage of high-strength steel in both the A and B pillars , floor crossmembers and rocker panels. The rear subframe is more rigid and has larger bushings for decreased NVH ( noise, vibration, and harshness ). The torsional rigidity is improved by 3 percent, which deducts 55 lb (25 kg) of its weight. [ 20 ] The vehicle is 5 mm (0.20 in) longer, 35 mm (1.4 in) wider, 15 mm (0.59 in) lower, and retains its 3,010 mm (119 in) wheelbase . The G80 had started its model years in the US in 2021. Trims consist of a 2.5T, 2.5T Advanced, a 2.5T Prestige, a 3.5T model, and a 3.5T Prestige. The Electrified model had arrived at the end of 2021. [ citation needed ] Design [ edit ] The design language of the Genesis includes quad- headlamps , and a large crest grille. The side profile features a parabolic line, and a fastback-type side view. The rear uses taillamp styling similar to the headlamps. The vehicle features Nappa leather seats. The vehicle also continues using Open Pore wood trim and has slim air conditioning vents. The horizontal layout of the dashboard was inspired by what the brand calls “Beauty of White Space”, which is Genesis’ interior styling design that is made to give the vehicle a "South Korean feel". [ 24 ] There is also a glass covered SBW (shift-by-wire) transmission. Rear view (pre-facelift) Interior (Electrified G80) Facelift [ edit ] Hyundai revealed the facelifted G80 on December 14, 2023, for the 2024 model year. Updates include micro-lens array headlight technology, a new grille pattern and front bumper, and redesigned alloy wheels. The rear bumper now features hidden exhaust outlets with "V-shape" chrome trim, reminiscent of the battery electric G80 variant. The interior changes include a 27-inch OLED display, replacing the separate 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and 14.5-inch infotainment system, powering the brand's latest CCIC software first seen in the GV60 small SUV and flagship G90 sedan. It also introduces a "crystal-like" shift-by-wire gear shifter, a touch-based climate control panel, revised trim, and a new steering wheel. The G80 Sport adds a unique "double-layered G-Matrix pattern" grille, larger air outlets , different front and rear bumpers, a D-cut steering wheel, and two carbon-look interior garnishes. The updated G80 will be available in ten exterior colors, including the new Brooklyn Brown, and four interior color options. [ 25 ] Front view (facelift) Rear view (facelift) Electrified G80 [ edit ] The Electrified G80 is the battery electric version of the G80. It debuted at the Shanghai Auto Show on 19 April 2021. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] It has been sold in South Korea since 2021. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] It is available in a dual-motor, all-wheel drive configuration. It uses two electric motors (272 kW combined), one at each axle, and a 87.2 kWh battery. The vehicle can charge from 10% to 80% in 22 minutes, if a 350 kW charger is available. [ 30 ] Just like the Ioniq 5 , it has a vehicle-to-load (V2L) function, meaning that various appliances like laptops or electric bikes can be plugged into the car (instead of a wall socket) and use the car as their power source. The Electrified G80 can be equipped with an optional solar roof. [ 30 ] The interior contains recycled materials, including leather made with natural dye (seats, console and rear seat armrests), scrap wood produced after making furniture ("forged wood" garnish) and thread spun from plastic bottles. The Electrified G80 offers a Disconnector Actuator System (DAS), an Active Noise Control-Road (ANC-R) system, a Preview Electronic Control Suspension (Pre-view ECS), a solar charging roof, a Vehicle to Load (V2L) system and a 400/800V multi rapid charging system. [ 31 ] In the United States, the Electrified G80 went on sale in August 2022 for the 2023 model year. Initial sales were limited to the states of California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and New York, with four more states added the following month. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] The Electrified G80 sold very slowly in the United States; 140 examples were delivered in 2024, followed by 77 more units in the first half of 2025, and Genesis quietly discontinued the car in August 2025. [ 34 ] The long wheelbase version of the Electrified G80 was used as the official VIP car for participating leaders and delegates at the 2022 G20 Summit in Bali , Indonesia with the wheelbase extended to 3,227 mm (127.0 in) and overall length to 5,222 mm (205.6 in). [ 35 ] [ 36 ] Electrified G80 (pre-facelift) Rear view (pre-facelift) Electrified G80 (facelift) Rear view (facelift) G80 Sport [ edit ] After the design release on July 5, 2021, [ 37 ] the Genesis G80 Sport was released on August 10, 2021. [ 38 ] This model introduced redesigned grills, bumpers, headlamps and wheels compared to the non-Sport model. A Cavendish Red paint color is exclusive for the G80 sports model. Two gasoline engines and a diesel are available. [ 39 ] The G80 Sport is also equipped with Rear Wheel Steering (RWS) system, a technology that actively controls the optimal rear-wheel steering angle along with front-wheel steering.

[ 53 ] Hyundai attributes flagging US sales in 2018 to disagreements among its dealership networks that caused deliberate dwindling supplies, not on reduced consumer demand.
