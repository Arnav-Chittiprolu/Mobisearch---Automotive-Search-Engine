( Chinese : 浙江华友钴业股份有限公司 ) is a major Chinese manufacturer of cobalt, nickel, and lithium materials used primarily in lithium-ion batteries. Founded in 2002 and headquartered in Tongxiang, Zhejiang, Huayou has grown into a vertically integrated supplier for the global electric vehicle (EV) battery industry, with operations spanning Africa, Southeast Asia, and Europe. History [ edit ] Huayou began as a cobalt refiner in China and expanded into mining by establishing operations in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) in 2006. It later diversified into battery material manufacturing, founding Quzhou Huayou Cobalt New Material Co., Ltd. in 2011. In 2015, the company listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange . Between 2016 and 2022, Huayou pursued aggressive international expansion. It partnered with LG Chem and POSCO on joint ventures to produce cathode materials, and invested in upstream mining projects in Indonesia and Zimbabwe. In 2022, it entered strategic alliances with Volkswagen Group China and Tsingshan Group to establish an integrated cathode supply chain. In 2023, Huayou joined Ford Motor Company and PT Vale Indonesia in developing a High-Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) nickel project in Sulawesi. The venture aims to improve the sustainability of nickel sourcing for EV batteries. Huayou also announced new facilities in Guangxi, Quzhou, and Hungary, underscoring its global ambitions. Operations [ edit ] Huayou's business model integrates mining, refining, materials manufacturing, and recycling. The company sources cobalt and copper through subsidiaries in the DRC, while nickel and lithium are procured through mining projects in Indonesia and Zimbabwe, respectively. These raw materials feed into Huayou's advanced material plants in Chengdu, Tianjin, Quzhou, and Guangxi, which produce cathode materials for both consumer electronics and electric vehicles. Through subsidiaries and joint ventures, Huayou supplies ternary precursors, cobalt tetroxide, nickel sulfate, and NCM cathode materials. It also maintains a closed-loop battery recycling business, capable of processing up to 65,000 tons of waste batteries annually. In 2022, its Chengdu B&M facility became the first cathode plant globally to achieve carbon neutrality under PAS 2060 certification. [ 2 ] The company claims its hydrometallurgy projects in Indonesia produce 80% fewer carbon emissions than traditional pyrometallurgy. Controversies [ edit ] In 2016, a joint report by Amnesty International and African Resources Watch accused Huayou's DRC subsidiary, Congo DongFang International Mining, of sourcing cobalt from artisanal mines that used child labor. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] In response, Huayou acknowledged shortcomings in supply chain oversight and began working to strengthen traceability. By 2018, the company joined the Fair Cobalt Alliance and began collaboration with major buyers, including Apple Inc. , Ford , and LG Chem . In 2019, it launched a blockchain pilot with IBM to enhance transparency in mineral sourcing.
