Its first Philippine branch, opened on April 22, 2013, is located at the Glorietta 3 mall in Makati . In 2017, Phoenix Petroleum Philippines, Inc. , a unit of the Davao-based conglomerate Udenna Corporation , acquired the franchise from the triumvirate; it was completed in 2018. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] There are now more than 65 stores in the Philippines, including those built at select Phoenix Petroleum stations. On November 21, 2019, FamilyMart opened its largest outlet in the world, with an area of 390 square meters (4,200 sq ft), at Udenna Tower in Bonifacio Global City , Taguig . [ 31 ] [ 32 ] However, several FamilyMart stores in the Philippines have closed since 2022, including the world's largest outlet, due to financial challenges faced by Udenna Corporation founder and owner Dennis Uy . By 2022, Phoenix reported a ₱ 191.1 million impairment loss on its investment. [ 33 ] Reports in 2023 attributed such closures to debts and unpaid obligations. [ 34 ] Taiwan [ edit ] In 1988, FamilyMart began opening stores in Taiwan. [ 35 ] As of October 2021, FamilyMart has over 3,600 stores in Taiwan. [ 35 ] FamilyMart provides banking and bill payment services and as of 2018, FamilyMart accepts the highest number of bill payments among convenience stores in Taiwan, with over 100 million bills paid per year. [ 36 ] A Taiwan FamilyMart is on the right, while another convenience store is right across the street. FamilyMart sued to end its partnership with Ting Hsin in 2019, which would end a 15-year joint venture . [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Vietnam [ edit ] FamilyMart opened its first store in Vietnam in 2009, starting in Ho Chi Minh City . [ 39 ] Initially the stores were operated in a joint venture with Vietnamese distributor Phu Thai Group , after 2013, both companies went their own way, and Phu Thai Group took over a number of FamilyMart stores and started operating them under its own brand B's Mart . As of 2017, FamilyMart operated 130 stores in Ho Chi Minh City. [ 40 ] Indonesia [ edit ] In 2012, FamilyMart planned to open 300 outlets in each Southeast Asian countries. They officially entered the Indonesian market in 2012 through a joint venture with PT Fajar Mitra Indah, which is a subsidiary of the Wings Group , one of the major Indonesian company. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] The first FamilyMart store in Indonesia opened on 16 October 2012 in Cibubur, followed by a second outlet on Jalan Bulungan, South Jakarta on 17 November 2012. Additional stores were subsequently launched in Pejaten (South Jakarta), Kelapa Gading (North Jakarta), and Thamrin Residence Apartment (Central Jakarta). [ 42 ] By 31 March 2013, FamilyMart had established six outlets in Jakarta. [ 42 ] In a major expansion move, PT Fajar Mitra Indah acquired 57 Starmart stores in early 2016 for Rp50 billion, after Starmart reported a net loss of Rp144 billion and closed 51 stores in 2015. The remaining 27 unsold Starmart stores were shut down. [ 43 ] As of June 2024, FamilyMart operated more than 270 outlets, primarily concentrated in the Greater Jakarta area ( Jabodetabek ). [ 44 ] By 2025, FamilyMart had expanded its footprint into more cities throughout Java Island , notably Surabaya , Malang and Bali . [ 45 ] Former [ edit ] Korea [ edit ] Main article: CU (store) FamilyMart in Kaesong Industrial Region . North Koreans are prohibited from using the convenience store, which was set up for the use of South Korean workers. South Korean currency is not accepted. [ 46 ] At the end of May 2012, the number of operating FamilyMart stores had reached 7,271. In June 2012, FamilyMart of South Korea , which was being run by FamilyMart Corporation and BGF Retail, was renamed and converted to ' CU ' (short for "Convenience for You") under ownership of BGF Retail after an order coming from BGF Retail that required FamilyMart to leave the South Korean market, and to cease operations there. [ 47 ] At the end of March 2014, FamilyMart withdrew from the South Korean market completely. In addition, South Korean franchisees had operated a number of stores at Kaesong Industrial Region and Mount Kumgang Tourist Region in North Korea for South Korean visitors and workers; all the stores are now closed. Thailand [ edit ] FamilyMart opened its first store in 1993 and grew to over 1,000 locations within the next decades. In May 2020, FamilyMart transferred their 49% stake of the Thai joint venture to partner Central Group . Despite FamilyMart's effective exit from the venture, they maintained licensing rights and store locations retained the company's name. [ 48 ] Their franchise agreement with Central ended in 2023, and FamilyMart exited Thailand as its roughly 200 remaining stores in the country were to be converted to Central's Tops Daily brand. [ 49 ] United States [ edit ] Main article: Famima!! Beginning in July 2005, FamilyMart began building and opening several stores in Los Angeles , California , under the name Famima!! . After freezing the number of locations at 10 in 2010, [ citation needed ] FamilyMart closed all eight of its Famima!! convenience stores in the United States and liquidated Famima Corp. USA, withdrawing from the United States in October 2015. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Solar power [ edit ] FamilyMart has had solar power at some of its stores since at least 2004. [ 52 ] It aims to increase its solar energy footprint in the future. There are around 45,000 convenience stores in Japan. Lawson run just under 10,000, a market share just behind 7-Eleven, who have about 13,000 stores. Currently, only 20 of Lawson's stores are equipped with solar equipment, but they plan to expand that number ahead of the July 1, 2012 introduction of a "feed-in tariff system", which the government and electricity companies say guarantees purchases of electricity from renewable sources such as solar or wind generators. Surplus power can be sold only after in-store lighting and air-conditioning have been powered. [ 53 ] Automatic cashiers [ edit ] On 30 January 2006, FamilyMart began trials of an automatic cashier station at one of its Tokyo stores in cooperation with Itochu and Toshiba . Special tags on items in the customer's shopping basket are remotely and instantly sensed at the register. Controversies [ edit ] Labor Commission case by franchise owners [ edit ] Seventeen convenience store owners of FamilyMart stores formed a union and requested collective bargaining with the company. They were refused and sued. In April 2015 the Central Labor Commission of Japan found that FamilyMart had violated the Trade Union Law by refusing to negotiate with the union. The franchise owners were recognized as employees under the trade union law, and the company was ordered to pledge to the union that it would not repeat the offence. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] Rat infestation incident [ edit ] In August 2019, footage emerged of as many as six rats scurrying through a FamilyMart store in Shibuya , near sushi displays and down aisles. FamilyMart responded by shutting the store, in order to investigate the cause of the problem, and apologised if the "unsanitary" footage had made customers feel "uneasy".
