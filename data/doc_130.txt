Some terms may be used within other English-speaking countries, or within the freight industry in general (air, rail, ship, and manufacturing). For example, shore power is a term borrowed from shipping terminology, in which electrical power is transferred from shore to ship, instead of the ship relying upon idling its engines. Drawing power from land lines is more efficient than engine idling and eliminates localized air pollution. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Another borrowed term is " landing gear " (from the aviation industry), which refers to the legs which support the front end of a semi-trailer when it is not connected to a semi-truck . Some nicknames are obvious wordplay, such as "portable parking lot", in reference to a truck that carries automobiles.

In some applications a semi can pull additional full trailers (doubles and triples) with the use of a single axle or tandem axle converter dolly. [ 10 ] The use of the term "semi" in the name comes from the semi-trailer, a vehicle whose load is carried partly by its own axles and partly by the pulling vehicle, which is commonly included in tractor-trailer rigs. Straight truck A single vehicle, with no articulation. Normally 2 or 3 axles, sometimes with lift axles . Tractor-trailer See semi-truck .

Dual wheels A pair of tire and wheel assemblies mounted side-by-side on a single axle hub. In some applications it is replaced by a super single . On pickup trucks it is sometimes called a dually . The assembly has a greater load carrying ability as compared to a single wheel. It also provides redundancy so if one of the two tires fail the second will maintain support preventing loss of vehicle control and allowing the vehicle to travel to a repair facility. [ 33 ] Engine brake Main article: Engine brake A braking system that utilizes the back pressure from the engine's pistons to slow down the vehicle. Commonly used to prevent heavy trucks from accelerating out of control while driving on steep downhill grades.

[ 10 ] Headache rack A sturdy aluminum wall or steel mesh structure affixed to the tractor between the cab and the fifth wheel to protect the tractor occupants from the load on the trailer.

[ 35 ] Super single A popular name for a single, larger wheel and tire, (properly called a "wide-base tire"), substituted for dual wheels , an adjacent pair assembly. The main benefit of a super single is a reduction in weight; combined with lower rolling resistance the super single promises better fuel economy. It also prevents rocks from being stuck in between, damaging tires or other vehicles (fling out). The disadvantage is the lack of tire redundancy from which dual wheels benefit, as tire failure can disable the vehicle [ 33 ] [ 36 ] and increased highway wear, through the high point loading and scrubbing of road surfaces when making tight turns.
