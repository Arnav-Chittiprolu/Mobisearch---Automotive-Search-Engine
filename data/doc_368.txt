GM introduced its first car in the country, the Chevrolet Opala , in 1968. In 1973, GM launched the Chevrolet Chevette , which has accumulated sales exceeding 1.2 million units. It was replaced by the Corsa in 1994, the first economy car with electronic fuel injection in Brazil, after tests were conducted near Indaiatuba . From 1968 until 2005, GM used Opel -developed cars badged as "Chevrolet". In July 2000, it launched the Industrial Complex of Gravataí in Rio Grande do Sul , one of the world's most modern factories. [ 3 ] After the globalization and sale of Opel to PSA Group (now Stellantis ), vehicles like the Chevrolet Onix were made from project designed and imported from SAIC-GM in Shanghai, China. Most designs came ready from Warren, mainly pickup trucks.

The Analysis & Opinion column of Jornal Já pointed this out as " blackmail ", given the company's history: What the world's largest automobile company is doing in Brazil is a scandalous synthesis of the prevailing spirit at the top of large multinational companies. (...) Claiming financial losses in its Brazilian operations, GM threatened to leave the country. An ultimatum? No, blatant blackmail. (...)
[I]t is hard to believe that the Brazilian market leader was not able to plan in advance for the slowdown in its activities over the next two years and, in the middle of the summer season, has to resort to a series of blackmail measures, many of them based on the labor reform of November 2017. It is an embarrassing situation for any executive. (...) The most astonishing thing about this story is that, recently, during the government of José Ivo Sartori, from the PMDB (2015-2018), GM obtained tax advantages to invest R$1.5 billion in an expansion of production capacity that would be implemented in 2019. The whole thing will fall into the lap of the new governor Eduardo Leite, from the PSDB (2019-2022).
