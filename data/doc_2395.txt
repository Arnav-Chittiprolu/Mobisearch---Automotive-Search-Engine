The first fuel cells were invented by Sir [[William Robert Grove|William Grove]] in 1838. The first commercial use of fuel cells came almost a century later following the invention of the hydrogen–oxygen fuel cell by [[Francis Thomas Bacon]] in 1932. The [[alkaline fuel cell]], also known as the Bacon fuel cell after its inventor, has been used in [[NASA]] space programs since the mid-1960s to generate power for [[satellites]] and [[space capsule]]s. Since then, fuel cells have been used in many other applications. Fuel cells are used for primary and backup power for commercial, industrial and residential buildings and in remote or inaccessible areas. They are also used to power [[fuel cell vehicle]]s, including forklifts, automobiles, buses,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Bronx Hydrogen Fuel Cell Bus |url=https://www.empirecleancities.org/ktc.html |access-date=2024-04-13 |website=Empire Clean Cities |language=en}}</ref> trains, boats, motorcycles, and submarines.

There are many types of fuel cells, but they all consist of an [[anode]], a [[cathode]], and an [[electrolyte]] that allows ions, often positively charged hydrogen ions (protons), to move between the two sides of the fuel cell. At the anode, a catalyst causes the fuel to undergo oxidation reactions that generate ions (often positively charged hydrogen ions) and electrons. The ions move from the anode to the cathode through the electrolyte. At the same time, electrons flow from the anode to the cathode through an external circuit, producing [[direct current]] electricity. At the cathode, another catalyst causes ions, electrons, and oxygen to react, forming water and possibly other products. Fuel cells are classified by the type of electrolyte they use and by the difference in start-up time ranging from 1 second for [[proton-exchange membrane fuel cell]]s (PEM fuel cells, or PEMFC) to 10 minutes for [[solid oxide fuel cell]]s (SOFC). A related technology is [[Flow battery|flow batteries]], in which the fuel can be regenerated by recharging. Individual fuel cells produce relatively small electrical potentials, about 0.7 volts, so cells are "stacked", or placed in series, to create sufficient voltage to meet an application's requirements.<ref>Nice, Karim and Strickland, Jonathan. [https://auto.howstuffworks.com/fuel-efficiency/alternative-fuels/fuel-cell.htm#pt2 "How Fuel Cells Work: Polymer Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells"]. How Stuff Works, accessed 4 August 2011</ref> In addition to electricity, fuel cells produce water vapor, heat and, depending on the fuel source, very small amounts of [[nitrogen dioxide]] and other emissions. PEMFC cells generally produce fewer nitrogen oxides than SOFC cells: they operate at lower temperatures, use hydrogen as fuel, and limit the diffusion of nitrogen into the anode via the proton exchange membrane, which forms [[NOx]]. The [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] of a fuel cell is generally between 40 and 60%; however, if waste heat is captured in a [[cogeneration]] scheme, efficiencies of up to 85% can be obtained.<ref name=Types1/>

In 1932, English engineer [[Francis Thomas Bacon]] successfully developed a 5&nbsp;kW stationary fuel cell.<ref name="BBC"/>  [[NASA]] used the [[alkaline fuel cell]] (AFC), also known as the Bacon fuel cell after its inventor, from the mid-1960s.<ref name="BBC">{{cite news |title=The Brits who bolstered the Moon landings |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/articles/cjl31dzp43jo |access-date=7 August 2019 |agency=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Apollo 11 mission 50 years on: The Cambridge scientist who helped put man on the moon |url=https://www.cambridgeindependent.co.uk/news/apollo-11-mission-50-years-on-the-cambridge-scientist-who-helped-put-man-on-the-moon-9077166/ |access-date=7 August 2019 |work=Cambridge Independent}}</ref>

In 1955, W. Thomas Grubb, a chemist working for the [[General Electric]] Company (GE), further modified the original fuel cell design by using a sulphonated polystyrene ion-exchange membrane as the electrolyte. Three years later another GE chemist, Leonard Niedrach, devised a way of depositing platinum onto the membrane, which served as a catalyst for the necessary hydrogen oxidation and oxygen reduction reactions. This became known as the "Grubb-Niedrach fuel cell".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americanhistory.si.edu/fuelcells/pem/pem2.htm|title=Fuel Cell Project: PEM Fuel Cells photo #2|website=americanhistory.si.edu}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://americanhistory.si.edu/fuelcells/pem/pemmain.htm|title=Collecting the History of Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells|website=americanhistory.si.edu}}</ref> GE went on to develop this technology with NASA and McDonnell Aircraft, leading to its use during [[Project Gemini]]. This was the first commercial use of a fuel cell. In 1959, a team led by Harry Ihrig built a 15&nbsp;kW fuel cell tractor for [[Allis-Chalmers]], which was demonstrated across the U.S. at state fairs. This system used potassium hydroxide as the electrolyte and [[compressed hydrogen]] and oxygen as the reactants. Later in 1959, Bacon and his colleagues demonstrated a practical five-kilowatt unit capable of powering a welding machine. In the 1960s, [[Pratt & Whitney]] licensed Bacon's U.S. patents for use in the U.S. space program to supply electricity and drinking water (hydrogen and oxygen being readily available from the spacecraft tanks).

[[UTC Power]] was the first company to manufacture and commercialize a large, stationary fuel cell system for use as a [[cogeneration]] power plant in hospitals, universities and large office buildings.<ref>{{cite web|title=The PureCell Model 400 – Product Overview |publisher=UTC Power |url=http://www.utcpower.com/products/purecell400 |access-date=2011-12-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211055124/http://www.utcpower.com/products/purecell400 |archive-date=11 December 2011}}</ref>

==Types of fuel cells; design==
Fuel cells come in many varieties; however, they all work in the same general manner. They are made up of three adjacent segments: the [[anode]], the [[electrolyte]], and the [[cathode]]. Two chemical reactions occur at the interfaces of the three different segments. The net result of the two reactions is that fuel is consumed, water or carbon dioxide is created, and an electric current is created, which can be used to power electrical devices, normally referred to as the load.

At the anode a [[catalyst]] ionizes the fuel, turning the fuel into a positively charged ion and a negatively charged electron. The electrolyte is a substance specifically designed so ions can pass through it, but the electrons cannot. The freed electrons travel through a wire creating an electric current. The ions travel through the electrolyte to the cathode. Once reaching the cathode, the ions are reunited with the electrons and the two react with a third chemical, usually oxygen, to create water or carbon dioxide.

[[File:Fuel Cell Block Diagram.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|A block diagram of a fuel cell]]
Design features in a fuel cell include:
* The electrolyte substance, which usually defines the ''type'' of fuel cell, and can be made from a number of substances like potassium hydroxide, salt carbonates, and phosphoric acid.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.energygroove.net/technologies/fuel-cells| title=Fuel Cells - EnergyGroove.net|work=EnergyGroove.net|access-date=2018-02-06}}</ref>
* The most common fuel that is used is hydrogen.
* The anode catalyst, usually fine platinum powder, breaks down the fuel into electrons and ions.
* The cathode catalyst, often nickel, converts ions into waste chemicals, with water being the most common type of waste.<ref name=TTI>{{Cite news|url=https://textechindustries.com/high-performance-materials| title=Reliable High Performance Textile Materials| work=Tex Tech Industries|access-date=2018-02-06}}</ref>
* Gas diffusion layers that are designed to resist oxidization.<ref name=TTI/>

A typical fuel cell produces a voltage from 0.6 to 0.7&nbsp;V at a full-rated load. Voltage decreases as current increases, due to several factors:
* [[Overpotential|Activation loss]]
* Ohmic loss ([[voltage drop]] due to resistance of the cell components and interconnections)
* Mass transport loss (depletion of reactants at catalyst sites under high loads, causing rapid loss of voltage).<ref name="Larminie2003">{{Cite book| last = Larminie | first = James | title = Fuel Cell Systems Explained, Second Edition | publisher = [[Society of Automotive Engineers|SAE International]] | date=1 May 2003| isbn = 978-0-7680-1259-0}}</ref>

To deliver the desired amount of energy, the fuel cells can be combined in [[series and parallel circuits|series]] to yield higher [[voltage]], and in parallel to allow a higher [[Electric current|current]] to be supplied. Such a design is called a ''fuel cell stack''. The cell surface area can also be increased, to allow higher current from each cell.

In the archetypical hydrogen–oxide [[proton-exchange membrane fuel cell]] (PEMFC) design, a proton-conducting polymer membrane (typically [[nafion]]) contains the [[electrolyte]] solution that separates the [[anode]] and [[cathode]] sides.<ref>Anne-Claire Dupuis, Progress in Materials Science, Volume 56, Issue 3, March 2011, pp. 289–327</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://personal.cityu.edu.hk/~kwanshui/Paper/IJHE2.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105234936/http://personal.cityu.edu.hk/~kwanshui/Paper/IJHE2.pdf|title=Measuring the relative efficiency of hydrogen energy technologies for implementing the hydrogen economy 2010|archive-date=5 November 2013}}</ref> This was called a ''solid polymer electrolyte fuel cell'' (''SPEFC'') in the early 1970s, before the proton-exchange mechanism was well understood. (Notice that the synonyms ''polymer electrolyte membrane'' and ''proton-exchange mechanism'' result in the same [[acronym]].)

On the anode side, hydrogen diffuses to the anode catalyst where it later dissociates into protons and electrons. These protons often react with oxidants causing them to become what are commonly referred to as multi-facilitated proton membranes. The protons are conducted through the membrane to the cathode, but the electrons are forced to travel in an external circuit (supplying power) because the membrane is electrically insulating. On the cathode catalyst, oxygen [[molecule]]s react with the electrons (which have traveled through the external circuit) and protons to form water.

In addition to this pure hydrogen type, there are [[hydrocarbon]] fuels for fuel cells, including [[diesel fuel|diesel]], [[methanol]] (''see:'' [[direct-methanol fuel cell]]s and [[indirect methanol fuel cell]]s) and chemical hydrides. The waste products with these types of fuel are [[carbon dioxide]] and water. When hydrogen is used, the CO{{sub|2}} is released when methane from natural gas is combined with steam, in a process called [[steam reforming|steam methane reforming]], to produce the hydrogen. This can take place in a different location to the fuel cell, potentially allowing the hydrogen fuel cell to be used indoors—for example, in forklifts.

The different components of a PEMFC are
# bipolar plates,
# [[electrode]]s,
# [[catalyst]],
# membrane, and
# the necessary hardware such as current collectors and gaskets.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Kakati | first1 = B.

If water is evaporated too quickly, the membrane dries, the resistance across it increases, and eventually, it will crack, creating a gas "short circuit" where hydrogen and oxygen combine directly, generating heat that will damage the fuel cell. If the water is evaporated too slowly, the electrodes will flood, preventing the reactants from reaching the catalyst and stopping the reaction. Methods to manage water in cells are being developed like [[electroosmotic pump]]s focusing on flow control. Just as in a combustion engine, a steady ratio between the reactant and oxygen is necessary to keep the fuel cell operating efficiently.
; Temperature management: The same temperature must be maintained throughout the cell in order to prevent destruction of the cell through [[thermal loading]]. This is particularly challenging as the 2H<sub>2</sub> + O<sub>2</sub> → 2H<sub>2</sub>O reaction is highly exothermic, so a large quantity of heat is generated within the fuel cell.

===Phosphoric acid fuel cell===
{{Main|Phosphoric acid fuel cell}}
Phosphoric acid fuel cells (PAFCs) were first designed and introduced in 1961 by [[G. V. Elmore]] and [[H. A. Tanner]]. In these cells, phosphoric acid is used as a non-conductive electrolyte to pass protons from the anode to the cathode and to force electrons to travel from anode to cathode through an external electrical circuit. These cells commonly work in temperatures of 150 to 200&nbsp;°C. This high temperature will cause heat and energy loss if the heat is not removed and used properly. This heat can be used to produce steam for air conditioning systems or any other thermal energy-consuming system.<ref name="americanhistory.si.edu">{{Cite web|url=https://americanhistory.si.edu/fuelcells/phos/pafcmain.htm|title=Collecting the History of Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells|website=americanhistory.si.edu}}</ref> Using this heat in [[cogeneration]] can enhance the efficiency of phosphoric acid fuel cells from 40 to 50% to about 80%.<ref name="americanhistory.si.edu"/> Since the proton production rate on the anode is small, platinum is used as a catalyst to increase this ionization rate. A key disadvantage of these cells is the use of an acidic electrolyte. This increases the corrosion or oxidation of components exposed to phosphoric acid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scopewe.com/phosphoric-acid-fuel-cells|title=Phosphoric Acid Fuel Cells|website=scopeWe - a Virtual Engineer|access-date=28 June 2013|archive-date=10 November 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110071945/http://scopewe.com/phosphoric-acid-fuel-cells/|url-status=usurped}}</ref>

===Solid acid fuel cell===
{{Main|Solid acid fuel cell}}

Solid acid fuel cells (SAFCs) are characterized by the use of a solid acid material as the electrolyte. At low temperatures, [[solid acid]]s have an ordered molecular structure like most salts. At warmer temperatures (between 140 and 150{{nbsp}}°C for CsHSO<sub>4</sub>), some solid acids undergo a phase transition to become highly disordered "superprotonic" structures, which increases conductivity by several orders of magnitude. SAFC systems use cesium dihydrogen phosphate (CsH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>) and have demonstrated lifetimes in the thousands of hours.<ref>{{Cite journal|last1=Haile|first1=Sossina M.|last2=Chisholm|first2=Calum R.

===Alkaline fuel cell===
{{Main|Alkaline fuel cell|Alkaline anion-exchange membrane fuel cell}}
The alkaline fuel cell (AFC) or hydrogen-oxygen fuel cell was designed and first demonstrated publicly by Francis Thomas Bacon in 1959. It was used as a primary source of electrical energy in the Apollo space program.<ref>{{Cite journal|title = Francis Thomas Bacon. 21 December 1904 – 24 May 1992|last = Williams|first = K.R.|s2cid = 71613260|date = 1 February 1994|journal = Biographical Memoirs of Fellows of the Royal Society|doi = 10.1098/rsbm.1994.0001|volume = 39|pages = 2–9|doi-access = free}}</ref> The cell consists of two porous carbon electrodes impregnated with a suitable catalyst such as Pt, Ag, CoO, etc. The space between the two electrodes is filled with a concentrated solution of [[Potassium hydroxide|KOH]] or [[Sodium hydroxide|NaOH]] which serves as an electrolyte. H<sub>2</sub> gas and O<sub>2</sub> gas are bubbled into the electrolyte through the porous carbon electrodes. Thus the overall reaction involves the combination of hydrogen gas and oxygen gas to form water. The cell runs continuously until the reactant's supply is exhausted. This type of cell operates efficiently in the temperature range 343–413{{nbsp}}K (70 -140&nbsp;°C) and provides a potential of about 0.9{{nbsp}}V.<ref>Srivastava, H. C.

===High-temperature fuel cells===

====Solid oxide fuel cell====
{{Main|Solid oxide fuel cell}}
[[Solid oxide fuel cell]]s (SOFCs) use a solid material, most commonly a ceramic material called [[yttria-stabilized zirconia]] (YSZ), as the [[electrolyte]]. Because SOFCs are made entirely of solid materials, they are not limited to the flat plane configuration of other types of fuel cells and are often designed as rolled tubes. They require high [[operating temperature]]s (800–1000&nbsp;°C) and can be run on a variety of fuels including natural gas.<ref name=Types1>[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/fuelcells/fc_types.html "Types of Fuel Cells"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100609041046/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/fuelcells/fc_types.html |date= 9 June 2010 }}. Department of Energy EERE website, accessed 4 August 2011</ref>

SOFCs are unique because negatively charged oxygen [[ion]]s travel from the [[cathode]] (positive side of the fuel cell) to the [[anode]] (negative side of the fuel cell) instead of [[proton]]s travelling vice versa (i.e., from the anode to the cathode), as is the case in all other types of fuel cells. Oxygen gas is fed through the cathode, where it absorbs electrons to create oxygen ions. The oxygen ions then travel through the electrolyte to react with hydrogen gas at the anode. The reaction at the anode produces electricity and water as by-products. Carbon dioxide may also be a by-product depending on the fuel, but the carbon emissions from a SOFC system are less than those from a [[fossil fuel]] combustion plant.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Stambouli | first1 = A.

SOFC systems can run on fuels other than pure hydrogen gas. However, since hydrogen is necessary for the reactions listed above, the fuel selected must contain hydrogen atoms. For the fuel cell to operate, the fuel must be converted into pure hydrogen gas. SOFCs are capable of internally [[Fossil fuel reforming|reforming]] light hydrocarbons such as [[methane]] (natural gas),<ref name=uva20130213>{{cite web|title=Methane Fuel Cell Subgroup|url=http://artsandsciences.virginia.edu/cchf/research/fuelcells.html|publisher=University of Virginia|access-date=2014-02-13|date=2012|archive-date=22 February 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222181513/http://artsandsciences.virginia.edu/cchf/research/fuelcells.html}}</ref> propane, and butane.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=A Kulkarni |author2=FT Ciacchi |author3=S Giddey |author4=C Munnings |author5=SPS Badwal |author6=JA Kimpton |author7=D Fini |title=Mixed ionic electronic conducting perovskite anode for direct carbon fuel cells|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|year=2012| volume=37|issue=24|pages=19092–19102| doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2012.09.141|bibcode=2012IJHE...3719092K }}</ref> These fuel cells are at an early stage of development.<ref>{{cite journal|author1=S.

Challenges exist in SOFC systems due to their high operating temperatures. One such challenge is the potential for carbon dust to build up on the anode, which slows down the internal reforming process. Research to address this "carbon coking" issue at the University of Pennsylvania has shown that the use of copper-based [[cermet]] (heat-resistant materials made of ceramic and metal) can reduce coking and the loss of performance.<ref>Hill, Michael. [http://www.ceramicindustry.com/Articles/Feature_Article/10637442bbac7010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____ "Ceramic Energy: Material Trends in SOFC Systems"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928023507/http://www.ceramicindustry.com/Articles/Feature_Article/10637442bbac7010VgnVCM100000f932a8c0____ |date=28 September 2011 }}. ''Ceramic Industry'', 1 September 2005.</ref> Another disadvantage of SOFC systems is the long start-up, making SOFCs less useful for mobile applications. Despite these disadvantages, a high operating temperature provides an advantage by removing the need for a precious metal catalyst like platinum, thereby reducing cost. Additionally, waste heat from SOFC systems may be captured and reused, increasing the theoretical overall efficiency to as high as 80–85%.<ref name=Types1/>

The high operating temperature is largely due to the physical properties of the YSZ electrolyte. As temperature decreases, so does the [[ionic conductivity (solid state)|ionic conductivity]] of YSZ. Therefore, to obtain the optimum performance of the fuel cell, a high operating temperature is required. According to their website, [[Ceres Power]], a UK SOFC fuel cell manufacturer, has developed a method of reducing the operating temperature of their SOFC system to 500–600 degrees Celsius. They replaced the commonly used YSZ electrolyte with a CGO (cerium gadolinium oxide) electrolyte. The lower operating temperature allows them to use stainless steel instead of ceramic as the cell substrate, which reduces cost and start-up time of the system.<ref>[http://www.cerespower.com/Technology/TheCeresCell/ "The Ceres Cell"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213064702/http://www.cerespower.com/Technology/TheCeresCell/ |date=13 December 2013 }}. ''Ceres Power website'', accessed 4 August 2011</ref>

====Molten-carbonate fuel cell====
{{Main|Molten carbonate fuel cell}}
[[Molten carbonate fuel cell]]s (MCFCs) require a high operating temperature, {{convert|650|°C|abbr=on|-1}}, similar to [[Solid oxide fuel cell|SOFCs]]. MCFCs use lithium potassium carbonate salt as an electrolyte, and this salt liquefies at high temperatures, allowing for the movement of charge within the cell – in this case, negative carbonate ions.<ref name=moltencarb>[http://www.fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/fuelcells/fuelcells_moltencarb.html "Molten Carbonate Fuel Cell Technology"]. U.S. Department of Energy, accessed 9 August 2011</ref>

Like SOFCs, MCFCs are capable of converting fossil fuel to a hydrogen-rich gas in the anode, eliminating the need to produce hydrogen externally. The reforming process creates {{CO2}} emissions. MCFC-compatible fuels include natural gas, [[biogas]] and gas produced from coal. The hydrogen in the gas reacts with carbonate ions from the electrolyte to produce water, carbon dioxide, electrons and small amounts of other chemicals. The electrons travel through an external circuit, creating electricity, and return to the cathode. There, oxygen from the air and carbon dioxide recycled from the anode react with the electrons to form carbonate ions that replenish the electrolyte, completing the circuit.<ref name=moltencarb/> The chemical reactions for an MCFC system can be expressed as follows:<ref>[http://www.fctec.com/fctec_types_mcfc.asp "Molten Carbonate Fuel Cells (MCFC)"]. FCTec.com, accessed 9 August 2011 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120303125426/http://www.fctec.com/fctec_types_mcfc.asp |date=3 March 2012 }}</ref>

:''Cathode reaction'': CO<sub>2</sub> + ½O<sub>2</sub> + 2e<sup>−</sup> → CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>
:''Overall cell reaction'': H<sub>2</sub> + ½O<sub>2</sub> → H<sub>2</sub>O

As with SOFCs, MCFC disadvantages include slow start-up times because of their high operating temperature. This makes MCFC systems not suitable for mobile applications, and this technology will most likely be used for stationary fuel-cell purposes. The main challenge of MCFC technology is the cells' short life span. The high-temperature and carbonate electrolyte lead to corrosion of the anode and cathode. These factors accelerate the degradation of MCFC components, decreasing the durability and cell life. Researchers are addressing this problem by exploring corrosion-resistant materials for components as well as fuel cell designs that may increase cell life without decreasing performance.<ref name=Types1/>

MCFCs hold several advantages over other fuel cell technologies, including their resistance to impurities. They are not prone to "carbon coking", which refers to carbon build-up on the anode that results in reduced performance by slowing down the internal fuel [[Fossil fuel reforming|reforming]] process. Therefore, carbon-rich fuels like gases made from coal are compatible with the system. The United States Department of Energy claims that coal, itself, might even be a fuel option in the future, assuming the system can be made resistant to impurities such as sulfur and particulates that result from converting coal into hydrogen.<ref name=Types1/> MCFCs also have relatively high efficiencies. They can reach a fuel-to-electricity efficiency of 50%, considerably higher than the 37–42% efficiency of a phosphoric acid fuel cell plant. Efficiencies can be as high as 65% when the fuel cell is paired with a turbine, and 85% if heat is captured and used in a [[cogeneration|combined heat and power]] (CHP) system.<ref name=moltencarb/>

[[FuelCell Energy]], a Connecticut-based fuel cell manufacturer, develops and sells MCFC fuel cells. The company says that their MCFC products range from 300&nbsp;kW to 2.8&nbsp;MW systems that achieve 47% electrical efficiency and can utilize CHP technology to obtain higher overall efficiencies. One product, the DFC-ERG, is combined with a gas turbine and, according to the company, it achieves an electrical efficiency of 65%.<ref>[http://www.fuelcellenergy.com/products.php "Products"].

The electric storage fuel cell is a conventional battery chargeable by electric power input, using the conventional electro-chemical effect. However, the battery further includes hydrogen (and oxygen) inputs for alternatively charging the battery chemically.<ref>''{{US patent|8354,195}}''</ref>

===Biofuel cell===
{{Main article|Microbial fuel cell|Enzymatic biofuel cell}}
A biofuel cell converts chemical energy from biological substances into electrical energy using biological catalysts, such as enzymes or microorganisms. The process involves the oxidation of a fuel, like glucose, at the anode, releasing electrons and protons. The electrons travel through an external circuit to generate electrical current, while at the cathode, oxygen is typically reduced to water or hydrogen peroxide, completing the circuit.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Huang |first1=Wengang |last2=Zulkifli |first2=Muhammad Yazid Bin |last3=Chai |first3=Milton |last4=Lin |first4=Rijia |last5=Wang |first5=Jingjing |last6=Chen |first6=Yuelei |last7=Chen |first7=Vicki |last8=Hou |first8=Jingwei |title=Recent advances in enzymatic biofuel cells enabled by innovative materials and techniques |journal=Exploration |date=August 2023 |volume=3 |issue=4 |article-number=20220145 |doi=10.1002/EXP.20220145|pmid=37933234 |pmc=10624391 }}</ref> Applications include wastewater treatment and renewable energy production.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Babanova |first1=Sofia |title=Biofuel Cells – Alternative Power Sources |journal=International Scientific Conference (FMNS2013), Blagoevgrad (Bulgaria) |date=2009 |url=https://inis.iaea.org/records/4884q-dkm61 |language=en}}</ref> Conductive polymers may be used to improve electron transfer between enzymes and electrodes.

==Efficiency of leading fuel cell types==
===Theoretical maximum efficiency===
The energy efficiency of a system or device that converts energy is measured by the ratio of the amount of useful energy put out by the system ("output energy") to the total amount of energy that is put in ("input energy") or by useful output energy as a percentage of the total input energy. In the case of fuel cells, useful output energy is measured in [[electrical energy]] produced by the system. Input energy is the energy stored in the fuel. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, fuel cells are generally between 40 and 60% energy efficient.<ref>[http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/fuelcells/pdfs/fc_comparison_chart.pdf "Comparison of Fuel Cell Technologies"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301120203/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/fuelcells/pdfs/fc_comparison_chart.pdf |date=1 March 2013 }}.

Solid-oxide fuel cells produce heat from the recombination of the oxygen and hydrogen. The ceramic can run as hot as {{cvt|800|C|F}}. This heat can be captured and used to heat water in a [[micro combined heat and power]] (m-CHP) application. When the heat is captured, total efficiency can reach 80–90% at the unit, but does not consider production and distribution losses. CHP units are being developed today for the European home market.

Professor Jeremy P. Meyers, in the [[Electrochemical Society]] journal ''Interface'' in 2008, wrote, "While fuel cells are efficient relative to combustion engines, they are not as efficient as batteries, primarily due to the inefficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction (and ... the oxygen evolution reaction, should the hydrogen be formed by electrolysis of water). ... [T]hey make the most sense for operation disconnected from the grid, or when fuel can be provided continuously. For applications that require frequent and relatively rapid start-ups ... where zero emissions are a requirement, as in enclosed spaces such as warehouses, and where hydrogen is considered an acceptable reactant, a [PEM fuel cell] is becoming an increasingly attractive choice [if exchanging batteries is inconvenient]".<ref name=Meyers1>Meyers, Jeremy P.

====In vehicles====
In a [[fuel cell vehicle]] the tank-to-wheel efficiency is greater than 45% at low loads<ref name=RSC>Eberle, Ulrich and Rittmar von Helmolt.

Energy & Environmental Science, [[Royal Society of Chemistry]], 14 May 2010, accessed 2 August 2011</ref> and shows average values of about 36% when a driving cycle like the NEDC ([[New European Driving Cycle]]) is used as test procedure.<ref name="status2007">{{Cite journal| title = Fuel Cell Vehicles:Status 2007 | journal=Journal of Power Sources | date = 20 March 2007 | doi = 10.1016/j.jpowsour.2006.12.073 | author = Von Helmolt, R. | volume = 165 | pages = 833–843 | last2 = Eberle | first2 = U| issue = 2| bibcode = 2007JPS...165..833V }}</ref> The comparable NEDC value for a Diesel vehicle is 22%.

It is also important to take losses due to fuel production, transportation, and storage into account. Fuel cell vehicles running on compressed hydrogen may have a power-plant-to-wheel efficiency of 22% if the hydrogen is stored as high-pressure gas, and 17% if it is stored as [[liquid hydrogen]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Efficiency of Hydrogen PEFC, Diesel-SOFC-Hybrid and Battery Electric Vehicles |date=15 July 2003 |url=http://www.efcf.com/reports/E04.pdf |access-date=2007-05-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061021051748/http://www.efcf.com/reports/E04.pdf |archive-date=21 October 2006 }}</ref>

===Power===
{{See also|Hydrogen fuel cell power plant}}
Stationary fuel cells are used for commercial, industrial and residential primary and backup power generation. Fuel cells are very useful as power sources in remote locations, such as spacecraft, remote weather stations, large parks, communications centers, rural locations including research stations, and in certain military applications. A fuel cell system running on hydrogen can be compact and lightweight, and have no major moving parts. Because fuel cells have no moving parts and do not involve combustion, in ideal conditions they can achieve up to 99.9999% reliability.<ref name="Fuel Cell Basics Benefits">{{cite web|title=Fuel Cell Basics: Benefits |publisher=Fuel Cells 2000 |url=http://www.fuelcells.org/basics/benefits.html |access-date=2007-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928225430/http://www.fuelcells.org/basics/benefits.html |archive-date=28 September 2007 }}</ref> This equates to less than one minute of downtime in a six-year period.<ref name="Fuel Cell Basics Benefits"/>

===Cogeneration===
{{See also|Combined cycle hydrogen power plant}}
Combined heat and power (CHP) fuel cell systems, including [[micro combined heat and power]] (MicroCHP) systems are used to generate both electricity and heat for homes (see [[home fuel cell]]), office building and factories. The system generates constant electric power (selling excess power back to the grid when it is not consumed), and at the same time produces hot air and water from the [[waste heat]]. As the result CHP systems have the potential to save primary energy as they can make use of waste heat which is generally rejected by thermal energy conversion systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/reduction-residential-carbon-dioxide-emissions-through-use-small-cogeneration-fuel-ce-7|title=Reduction of residential carbon dioxide emissions through the use of small cogeneration fuel cell systems – Combined heat and power systems|publisher=IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme (IEAGHG)|date=11 November 2008|access-date=2013-07-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203185449/http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/reduction-residential-carbon-dioxide-emissions-through-use-small-cogeneration-fuel-ce-7|archive-date=3 December 2013}}</ref> A typical capacity range of [[home fuel cell]] is 1–3&nbsp;kW<sub>el</sub>, 4–8&nbsp;kW<sub>th</sub>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/reduction-residential-carbon-dioxide-emissions-through-use-small-cogeneration-fuel-c-20|title=Reduction of residential carbon dioxide emissions through the use of small cogeneration fuel cell systems – Scenario calculations|publisher=IEA Greenhouse Gas R&D Programme (IEAGHG)|date=11 November 2008|access-date=2013-07-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131026035842/http://www.globalccsinstitute.com/publications/reduction-residential-carbon-dioxide-emissions-through-use-small-cogeneration-fuel-c-20|archive-date=26 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cogen.org/|title=cogen.org – body shop in nassau county}}</ref> CHP systems linked to [[absorption chiller]]s use their waste heat for [[refrigeration]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fchea.org/core/import/PDFs/CHP%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120518094954/http://www.fchea.org/core/import/PDFs/CHP%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|title=Fuel Cells and CHP|archive-date=18 May 2012}}</ref>

Storing hydrogen requires more energy either to cool it down to the liquid state or to put it into tanks under high pressure, and delivering the hydrogen to fueling stations requires more energy and may release more carbon.
