From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from GM BEV3 ) Motor vehicle platform General Motors BEV3 platform Cadillac Lyriq , the first vehicle based on the BEV3 platform Overview Manufacturer General Motors Production 2022–present Body and chassis Layout Front-motor, front-wheel-drive Rear-motor, rear-wheel-drive Dual-motor, all-wheel-drive Related GM BT1 Chronology Predecessor GM BEV2 The General Motors BEV3 platform is a dedicated electric vehicle architecture or platform developed by General Motors . It is the third-generation electric vehicle platform by GM, succeeding the BEV2 platform . [ 1 ] It is categorized as a skateboard platform . [ 2 ] History [ edit ] Honda announced it would partner with General Motors to develop "next-generation" batteries in 2018. [ 3 ] The BEV3 architecture was first announced by GM in January 2019, [ 4 ] with Cadillac announced as the lead marque, [ 5 ] and BEV3 was officially detailed on March 4, 2020, during the GM EV Day briefing in Warren, Michigan , and supports Ultium batteries and Ultium Drive motors. [ 6 ] In 2021, Honda announced it would release two SUVs in 2024 under the Honda and Acura marques, developed in partnership with GM; [ 7 ] it was clarified in 2022 the new Honda SUVs would be built alongside GM SUVs, using Ultium batteries and GM's electric vehicle platform. [ 8 ] Design [ edit ] The BEV3 platform is designed to support unibody passenger cars and crossover utility vehicles, while body-on-frame trucks and SUVs will be based on the General Motors BT1 platform . [ 9 ] BEV3 supports front-, rear-, and all-wheel drive configurations [ 5 ] [ 10 ] using one or more Ultium Drive units, each of which combines the electric traction motor, reduction gear, and power electronics. [ 11 ] GM claim that BEV3 will offer a larger footprint with lower height, greater energy density, and faster charging rate compared to BEV2. The modular design will allow from six to twenty-four battery modules under the floor, depending on energy storage requirements. [ 12 ] Premium vehicles that use the BEV3 platform have the option of a 4–6 in (100–150 mm) larger dash-to-axle ratio, [ a ] resulting in a longer hood that is intended to recall the classic proportions of personal luxury cars designed by Bill Mitchell for GM. [ 14 ] Applications [ edit ] Current models [ edit ] Acura ZDX (2024–2025) [ 15 ] Buick Electra E4 (2023–2025) [ 16 ] Buick Electra E5 (2023–present) [ 17 ] Cadillac Celestiq (2024–present) [ 9 ] Cadillac Lyriq (2022–present) [ 18 ] Cadillac Optiq (2024–present) [ 19 ] Cadillac Vistiq (2025–present) [ 20 ] Chevrolet Blazer EV (2023–present) [ 21 ] Chevrolet Equinox EV (2024–present) [ 22 ] Honda Prologue (2024–present) [ 8 ] [ 23 ] Acura ZDX Buick Electra E4 Buick Electra E5 Cadillac Lyriq Cadillac Celestiq Cadillac Optiq Cadillac Vistiq Chevrolet Blazer EV Chevrolet Equinox EV Honda Prologue See also [ edit ] General Motors BEV2 platform Ultium , the battery and motor used for the platform References [ edit ] Notes ^ Dash-to-axle is defined as the distance between the cowl and the centerline of the front axle. The dash-to-axle ratio concept first received broad attention when Edsel Ford was directing the design of the Lincoln Continental in the late 1930s. Typically, a longer dash-to-axle ratio results in a long hood, with consonant implications of a more powerful engine and rear-wheel-drive layout.
