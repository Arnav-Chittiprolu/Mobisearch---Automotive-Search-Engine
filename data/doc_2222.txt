[ 3 ] The connector has a lemniscate shape ( ∞ ), with a flat bottom edge and is planned for charging battery electric vehicles at up to 900 kilowatts using direct current .  The design incorporates backward compatibility with CHAdeMO (used globally) and the GB/T DC-charging (used mainly in mainland China), [ 4 ] using a dedicated inlet adapter for each system. The circuit interface of ChaoJi is also designed to be fully compatible with the Combined Charging System , also known as CCS (used mainly in Europe and North America). [ 5 ] A joint agreement between the CHAdeMO association and the China Electricity Council (with State Grid Corporation of China ) was signed on 28 August 2018 [ 6 ] after which the development was enlarged to a larger international community of experts. [ 7 ] Implementation [ edit ] The new EVs implementing the standard are to be fitted with a female ChaoJi DC inlet, with a vehicle-side locking mechanism. This inlet can be co-sited in a "Combo" format underneath a GB/T-AC inlet (female), an SAE J1772 AC inlet (male), or 1‒3-phase AC Type 2 inlet (male). [ 8 ] For the charging infrastructure, DC fast-chargers would be fitted with the common ChaoJi male plug outlet and implement one or more variations of communication protocols: [ 8 ] ChaoJi-1 operating under the GB/T protocol, for primary deployment in mainland China. ChaoJi-2 operating under the CHAdeMO 3.0 protocol, for primary deployment in Japan and other parts of the world. Communication between the car and charger would use a CAN bus for both ChaoJi-1 and -2. [ 8 ] A unified communication protocol based on Ethernet is also under consideration. [ 9 ] Power transfer pins are 10-millimetre-diameter (0.4 in) and attached to the infrastructure (male) side. [ 2 ] [ 10 ] The connector is designed to be at least as strong as a CHAdeMO outlet. [ 1 ] Updates to the ChaoJi standard enables compatibility with the CHAdeMO 3.1 protocol (and by extension CCS). [ 11 ] Megawatt charging [ edit ] A new coupler codenamed  'Ultra-ChaoJi' with an additional set of power pins above the standard ChaoJi pinouts, is currently under development. Ultra-ChaoJi is expected to be used by electrified heavy-duty vehicles (HDVs), airplanes and ships in the near future. [ 12 ] Etymology [ edit ] The name comes from pinyin : chāojí , meaning "super". The reason for choosing such a name was multifactorial. Other than the reference to supercharging, the word ChaoJi itself sounds similar to "charger" and, like CHAdeMO, starts with "Cha".
