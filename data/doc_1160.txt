It was manufactured and marketed by Mercedes-Benz in sedan/saloon (2007–2014), station wagon/estate (2008–2014) and coupé (2011–2015) bodystyles, with styling by Karlheinz Bauer and Peter Pfeiffer. The C-Class was available in rear- or all-wheel drive , the latter marketed as 4MATIC . The W204 platform was also used for the E-Class Coupé (C207) . [ 10 ] Sub-models included the C 200 Kompressor , the C 230, the C 280, the C 350, the C 220 CDI, and the C 320 CDI. The C 180 Kompressor, C 230, and C 200 CDI were available in the beginning of August 2007. [ 11 ] The W204 station wagon was not marketed in North America. [ 12 ] Production reached over 2.4 million worldwide, and the W204 was the brand's best selling vehicle at the time. [ 13 ] Development [ edit ] In the summer of 2003, the development of the W204 C-Class used a "digital prototype", a 2.1 terabyte digital replica of the car, over a virtual distance of 15 million miles. An industry first, the digital testing allowed for crash testing before a physical prototype existed. The design of W204 was finalized in 2003 and a German design patent application was first filed on 9 September 2004, demonstrating a W204 fiberglass design model. [ 14 ] DaimlerChrysler introduced the W204 C-Class on 18 January 2007 [ 15 ] at the 2007 Geneva Auto Show . Deliveries began in late March 2007 in almost all European countries. Trim levels [ edit ] Saloon (pre-facelift) Interior (pre-facelift) Typically, Mercedes offered the W204 in three trim and equipment levels, marketed as Classic, Elegance and Avantgarde. The base trim, marketed as Classic, was offered with smaller four-cylinder engines and cloth seats or optional leatherette , marketed as ARTICO . Elegance trim featured standard leatherette upholstery with optional leather. The Avantgarde offered Liverpool fabric/leatherette seats or optional leather. Classic and Elegance retained a traditional Mercedes-Benz grille , with horizontal chrome bars and standing hood emblem. Avantgarde trim featured a 'sport' grille with three wide matt-finish horizontal bars and a large, central emblem as well as an optional AMG bodykit, sport seats, three-spoke sport steering wheel, lower and stiffer sports suspension, upgraded brake piston calipers, and larger alloy wheels. W204s advertising predominantly featured the sport grille and AMG bodykit, especially in Canada and the United States. The W204 line offered a range of four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines, a 3.5-litre V6 petrol and a 3.0-litre V6 diesel engine are also available. The AMG variant, marketed as the C 63 AMG used the 6.2-litre V8 petrol engine. [ 16 ] In the United Kingdom, the Classic trim level was marketed as the SE, and the Avantgarde trim with the AMG Sport Package was marketed as the Sport. In the United States, the C250, made in South Africa, in Avantgarde trim with the AMG Sport Package was available on the C-250 with a four-cylinder turbocharged 1.8L engine, 7 speed automatic gearbox and RWD and the C-300 (the only US market C-Class with a standard manual transmission (manual transmission was only available with RWD), with 4MATIC system available as an option) and the C 350 Sport (RWD only).The Elegance trim was only available on the C 300 Luxury with an option for the 4MATIC all-wheel-drive system, There were no Classic/SE trim models, no models with diesel engine, and no station wagon models available in the US market. The Canadian market offered only the AMG Line trim level; four-cylinder models and station wagon models were not offered. The base C 230 model (renamed the C 250 from the 2010 model year) was exclusive to the Canadian market and was the only model that has amenities similar to the Elegance/Luxury trim with the traditional grille and three-point star hood ornament. The other C-Class models (C 300, C 350 and C 63 respectively) offered the AMG body kit and sport grille as standard. These amenities were available as an CAD800 option for the C 230 model as the Sport Package (which rose to CAD1200 for the 2011 model year due to the new LED fog lights). All models except the C 63 AMG and C350 were available in both rear-wheel-drive and all-wheel-drive (4Matic). [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Equipment [ edit ] For the 2008–2011 model year, the dashtop features a deployable central sliding cover panel over an LCD colour screen for entertainment and information functions. The optional navigation system, marketed as COMAND APS integrates a larger, 7-inch TFT screen into the deployable panel. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Post MY2012 models feature a fixed screen similar to E-Class and GLK-Class models. 2010 W204s received revised turn signals integrated into the side mirrors. From the 2011 model year on, the bumper fog lamps in the AMG bodykit were replaced by LED lights, except for the C 63 AMG which retained its unique bumper. The C-class offered a system marketed as the agility control package, which provided revised agility and ride quality via hydro-mechanics, which analysed road conditions and driving habits, and adjusted damper and suspension settings to provide a balance between ride comfort and agility. An optional advanced agility control package offered a sport mode button to enable a stiffer suspension setting and more precise handling.

An 'Exclusive Driving Experience' campaign in Barcelona (1–3 April 2007) allowed some 80 consumers from all over Europe to experience the C-Class in an especially attractive environment. Vacationers who stayed at selected Robinson Club Resorts and Westin Hotels & Resorts facilities in Germany, Austria, Scotland, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Greece between May and September 2007 had the opportunity to test-drive the new C-Class. Premium shopping mall attendants could also test drive the cars during April and May 2007. The new C-Class also appeared in the German Touring Car Masters series starting on 22 April 2007. Mercedes-Benz also started a Mobile Special campaign that included special mobile client software that could be called up either by text messaging (SMS) from a number assigned to each country or directly from the Mercedes-Benz website in the participating markets. The Mobile Special also contained the dates of C-Class events and invitations to callers. The C-Class Avantgarde model with the AMG package appeared in the game Second Life starting on 16 March 2007, where the player can purchase the virtual model for 1,500 Linden Dollars or virtually test-drive it on a challenging track. [ 61 ] As part of the C-Class station wagon campaign, Mercedes-Benz launched a print ad showing the C-Class station wagon on a stage, flanked by a curtain and background scenery.

Mercedes-Benz also held test driving events between December 2007 and April 2008 in selected Robinson Club resorts, various vacation resorts in Fuerteventura and Turkey, Serfaus , Fiss , Ladis , and Ski Amadé (Austria). Between December 2007 and January 2008, spontaneous test driving events were also held in selected upmarket shopping centres and malls in Germany.

There was also a minor revision of the exterior appearance which included LED daytime running lights, LED taillights, a new hood and bumpers. The interior was significantly reworked to bring its arrangement and quality closer to the W212 E-Class and the W221 S-Class . There is a high resolution screen on the dashboard which has visual functions similar to the S and CL Class models, and it also has the new Mercedes-Benz Comand APS system first seen on the W212 E-Class. Ten new driving assistance systems, including Adaptive Highbeam Assist, Active Lane Keeping Assist, Active Blind Spot Assist, Attention Assist drowsiness detection, Distronic Plus proximity control, Speed Limit Assist and Parking guidance including Parktronic and the Pre-Safe brake were now available.

The C 300 and C 300 4Matic (having the 3.0-litre V6 engine) retained their 90-degree vee-angle V6 engines and the 7G-tronic transmission, while the 6-speed manual transmission which was previously available for the rear-wheel drive C 230/250 and the C 300 was discontinued in the North American markets due to low sales. For the 2013 model year, the C 300 received the new 60-degree vee-angle V6 engine , which shares the same displacement but is detuned from the 3.5-litre engine found in the 2012 and later C 350. The C 300's new 3.5-litre engine generates a power output of 248 hp (185 kW; 251 PS) and 251 lb⋅ft (340 N⋅m) of torque, as compared to the 228 hp (170 kW; 231 PS) and 221 lb⋅ft (300 N⋅m) of torque from the old M272 3.0-litre engine. [ 76 ] [ 77 ] Canada [ edit ] For the 2012 model year, the C 250 RWD sedan with its turbocharged inline-4 engine (replacing the 2010–11 C 250 model with a 2.5-litre V6 which was badged as the C 230 from 2008 to 2009) was sold alongside the C 250 4Matic (another Canada-only model with a 2.5-litre V6 which was badged as the C 230 4Matic from 2008 to 2009) since the 4Matic system was not compatible with the turbocharged inline-4 engine. [ 78 ] For the 2013 model year, the sedan lineup was simplified considerably with the C 250 turbo inline-4 RWD, C 300 4MATIC, C 350 RWD, C 350 4MATIC, and C 63 AMG.

Inspiring" or "Adrenaline accelerator included" accentuate the vehicle's modern image. The two 45- and 30-second cinema ads also take a humorous approach to the campaign slogan "More glances per hour", which was released on 19 May 2011 serving as sequel to the Drive & Seek, linking back to the bank robbery featured in the film.
