With revenues more than US158.8 billion in 2024, [ 1 ] JD.com is China’s largest retailer by revenue, and ranks 47 on Fortune Global 500 . It is one of the two massive B2C online retailers in China by transaction volume and revenue, and is a major competitor to Alibaba -run Tmall . [ 7 ] JD.com’s portfolio spans across retail, technology, logistics, health care, industrials, property management, private label, insurance, and international business. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] The company was founded by Liu Qiangdong on 18 June 1998, and its retail platform went online in 2004. It started as an online magneto-optical store, but soon diversified, selling electronics, mobile phones, computers, and similar items. The company changed its domain name to 360buy.com in June 2007 and then to JD.com in 2013. [ 10 ] At the same time, JD.com announced its new logo and mascot. History [ edit ] Early years [ edit ] The company was founded in 1998 as Jingdong, which was named after Liu Qiangdong's former girlfriend Gong Xiaojing and himself. [ 11 ] In 2004, the company's B2C site went online as jdlaser.com. [ 12 ] The company began using the domain name 360buy.com, [ 12 ] and the name was changed to Jingdong Mall in 2007. [ 13 ] In 2007, JD.com established an in-house logistics department in order to provide more reliable and timely delivery service to consumers. [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Since 2009, JD.com has set up a customer service center in Suqian , cumulatively investing over 30 billion RMB to build its self-operated customer service center. As a result, the company now operates the industry's largest customer service team. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] On 10 December 2010, JD's founder Liu Qiangdong announced through his Weibo account that every book sold on JD.com would be priced at 20 percent cheaper than its competitors. [ 19 ] [ 20 ] On December 14, 2010, Dangdang also began to offer discounts to customers and stated that the company would invest 40 million Chinese yuan to give discounts to customers. As a result, JD.com launched the second promotion to sell books at a lower price than Dangdang [ 21 ] and announced that it would give coupons instead of reducing prices to protect the benefits of publishers. [ 22 ] In November 2011, JD.com provided its customers with a 10 percent discount on books, while Dangdang sent promotional messages to its users. [ 23 ] The sudden increase of orders not only caused network errors but also postponed transits of books. [ 24 ] JD.com started the e-book selling business online on 20 February 2012, and provided customers with more than 80,000 electronic books. [ 25 ] On 17 April 2013, most of the e-books on Dangdang's website were free for users to download. [ 26 ] Consequently, Dangdang launched its flagship store on JD.com in 2023. [ 27 ] In 2013, the company's domain name was changed to JD.com. [ 6 ] [ 10 ] Listing [ edit ] In 2014, JD.com’s Nasdaq IPO raised $18 billion USD, valuing the company at approximately $26 billion and making it the largest Chinese company to be listed only in the United States.

[ 30 ] In February 2018, it released its spin-off JD Finance , raising $2.1 billion in a capital raise. [ 31 ] In April 2020, the company confidentially filed for a second listing in Hong Kong [ 32 ] and began trading on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange for HK $239 in June 2020. [ 33 ] In 2020, JD.com announced that would be investing $830 million in its JD Health unit, provided by private equity firm Hillhouse Capital .
