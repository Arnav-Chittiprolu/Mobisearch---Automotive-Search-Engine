Alternators may be classified by the method of excitation, number of phases, the type of rotation, cooling method, and their application.<ref name="faa">{{cite book|title=Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook—General (FAA-H-8083-30) |date=2008|url= http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/amt_handbook/media/FAA-8083-30_Ch10.pdf |publisher=Federal Aviation Administration |pages=10_160–10_161|access-date=6 September 2013|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130906013000/http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/amt_handbook/media/FAA-8083-30_Ch10.pdf |archive-date=6 September 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref>

=== By excitation ===
There are two main ways to produce the magnetic field used in the alternators: by using [[permanent magnet]]s, which create their persistent magnetic field, or by using [[field coil]]s. The alternators that use permanent magnets are specifically called [[Magneto (generator)|magnetos]].{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}
 
In other alternators, wound field coils form an [[electromagnet]] to produce the rotating magnetic field.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

A device that uses permanent magnets to produce alternating current is called a permanent magnet alternator (PMA). A permanent magnet generator (PMG) may produce either alternating current or direct current if it has a [[Commutator (electric)|commutator]].{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

==== Direct-connected direct-current (DC) generator ====
This method of excitation consists of a smaller [[direct current|direct-current]] (DC) generator fixed on the same shaft as the alternator. The DC generator generates a small amount of electricity, just enough to ''excite'' the field coils of the connected alternator to generate electricity. A variation of this system is a type of alternator that uses direct current from a battery for initial excitation upon start-up, after which the alternator becomes self-excited.<ref name="faa"/>

==== Direct-connected alternating-current (AC) generator ====
This method of excitation consists of a smaller [[alternating current|alternating-current]] (AC) generator fixed on the same shaft as the alternator. The AC stator generates a small amount of field coil excitation current, which is induced in the rotor and rectified to DC by a bridge rectifier built in to the windings where it excites the field coils of the larger connected alternator to generate electricity. This system has the advantage of not requiring brushes, which increases service life, although with a slightly lower overall efficiency. A variation of this system is a type of alternator that uses direct current from a battery for initial excitation upon start-up, after which the alternator becomes self-excited.<ref name="faa"/>

==== Transformation and rectification ====
This method depends on residual magnetism retained in the iron core to generate a weak magnetic field, which would allow a weak voltage to be generated. This voltage is used to excite the field coils so the alternator can generate stronger voltage as part of its ''build up'' process. After the initial AC voltage buildup, the field is supplied with [[rectifier|rectified voltage]] from the alternator.<ref name="faa"/>

==== Brushless alternators ====
A brushless alternator is composed of two alternators built end-to-end on one shaft. Until 1966, alternators used brushes with rotating field.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.stamford-avk.com/heritage/cummins-generator-technologies |title=Cummins Generator Technologies |website=stamford-avk.com|publisher=Cummins Generator Technologies |access-date=18 August 2022}}</ref> With the advancement in semiconductor technology, brushless alternators are possible. Smaller brushless alternators may look like one unit, but the two parts are readily identifiable in the large versions. The main alternator is the larger of the two sections, and the smaller one is the exciter. The exciter has stationary field coils and a rotating armature (power coils). The main alternator uses the opposite configuration with a rotating field and stationary armature. A [[bridge rectifier]], called the rotating rectifier assembly, is mounted on the rotor. Neither brushes nor slip rings are used, which reduces the number of wearing parts. The main alternator has a rotating field and a stationary armature (power generation windings).

Varying the amount of current through the stationary exciter field coils varies the 3-phase output from the exciter. This output is rectified by a rotating rectifier assembly mounted on the rotor, and the resultant DC supplies the rotating field of the main alternator and hence alternator output. The result is that a small DC exciter current indirectly controls the output of the main alternator.<ref>G. K. Dubey, ''Fundamentals of Electrical Drives'', CRC Press, 2002, {{ISBN|084932422X}}, page 350</ref>

=== By number of phases ===
{{Main|Single-phase generator|Polyphase coil}}
Another way to classify alternators is by the number of phases of their output voltage. The output can be single-phase or polyphase. Three-phase alternators are the most common, but polyphase alternators can be two-phase, six-phase, or more.<ref name="faa"/>

=== By rotating part ===
The revolving part of alternators can be the [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] or the magnetic field. The revolving armature type has the armature wound on the rotor, where the winding moves through a stationary magnetic field. The revolving armature type is not often used.<ref name="faa"/> The revolving field type has a magnetic field on the rotor to rotate through a stationary armature winding. The advantage is that then the rotor circuit carries much less power than the armature circuit, making the [[slip ring]] connections smaller and less costly; only two contacts are needed for the direct-current rotor, whereas often a rotor winding has three phases, and multiple sections which would each require a slip-ring connection. The stationary armature can be wound for any convenient medium voltage level, up to tens of thousands of volts; manufacture of slip ring connections for more than a few thousand volts is costly and inconvenient.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}}

=== Cooling methods ===
Many alternators are cooled by ambient air, forced through the enclosure by an attached fan on the shaft that drives the alternator.  In vehicles such as transit buses, a heavy demand on the electrical system may require a large alternator to be oil-cooled.<ref>Gus Wright, ''Fundamentals of Medium/Heavy Duty Diesel Engines'', Jones & Bartlett Publishers, 2015,  {{ISBN|128406705X}} page 1233</ref> In marine applications water-cooling is also used. Expensive automobiles may use water-cooled alternators to meet high electrical system demands.{{citation needed|date=August 2022}} Edit summary (Briefly describe your changes) By publishing changes, you agree to the Terms of Use , and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and the GFDL .
