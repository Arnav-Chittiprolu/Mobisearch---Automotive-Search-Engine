From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from 2170 battery ) 3LR12 (4.5-volt), D , C , AA , AAA , AAAA [ 1 ] (1.5-volt), A23 (12-volt), PP3 (9-volt), CR2032 (3-volt), and LR44 (1.5-volt) batteries (Matchstick for reference) This is a list of the sizes, shapes, and general characteristics of some common primary and secondary battery types in household, automotive and light industrial use. The complete nomenclature for a battery specifies size, chemistry, terminal arrangement, and special characteristics. The same physically interchangeable cell size or battery size may have widely different characteristics; physical interchangeability is not the sole factor in substituting a battery. [ 2 ] The full battery designation identifies not only the size, shape and terminal layout of the battery but also the chemistry (and therefore the voltage per cell) and the number of cells in the battery. For example, a CR123 battery is always LiMnO 2 ('Lithium') chemistry, in addition to its unique size. The following tables give the common battery chemistry types for the current common sizes of batteries. See Battery chemistry for a list of other electrochemical systems.

The later version of the battery used alkaline batteries. Button cells – coin, watch [ edit ] See also: Button cell Lithium cells [ edit ] Coin cells of various diameters and thicknesses. Coin-shaped cells are thin compared to their diameter. Polarity is usually stamped on the metal casing. The IEC prefix "CR" denotes lithium manganese dioxide chemistry. Since LiMnO 2 cells produce 3 volts there are no widely available alternative chemistries for a lithium coin battery. The "BR" prefix indicates a round lithium/carbon monofluoride cell. See lithium battery for discussion of the different performance characteristics. One LiMnO 2 cell can replace two alkaline or silver-oxide cells. IEC designation numbers indicate the physical dimensions of the cylindrical cell. Cells less than one centimeter in height are assigned three- or four-digit numbers, where the last two digits are the height in tenths of millimeters, and the preceding digit(s) are the diameter in millimeters, rounded down (see table here ). Taller cells are assigned five-digit numbers, where the first two digits are the diameter in millimeters, followed by the last three digits indicating the height in tenths of millimeters. All these lithium cells are rated nominally 3 volts (on-load), with open-circuit voltage about 3.6 volts. Manufacturers may have their own part numbers for IEC standard size cells. The capacity listed is for a constant resistance discharge down to 2.0 volts per cell.

Other applications include TPMS sensors, electronic styluses, and real-time clock backup power. Weighs less than 1 gram, and has a very low self-discharge rate. Uncommon size, well-suited for installation into narrow tubular devices. It is unusual for having a 3.5 mm long, 1 mm diameter pin connected to the negative terminal. The case is typically not wrapped with a label, so it can function as the positive terminal. Typically installed by inserting the cell in the direction of its longest dimension, pin first. It can be used in place of BR425, BR435, and P139 batteries. Also available in a 3.7 V rechargeable Lithium-ion variant, LIR425, with LiCoO 2 chemistry.

Many are also available with protection circuits that can increase their physical length; for example, an 18650 is around 65 mm (2.56 in) long, but may be around 68 mm (2.68 in) long with a protection circuit. Some such circuits increase cell diameter instead. The increased dimensions may mean the cell will no longer fit in battery compartments intended for cells without such circuitry. Commonly-used designation numbers indicate the physical dimensions of the cylindrical cell, as given in IEC standard 60086-1 for cylindrical primary cells. The first two digits are the nominal diameter of the cell in millimetres, and the two following digits are generally the height in millimeters, with the fifth digit indicating cylindrical shape. Alternately, the last three digits can refer to the height in tenths of a millimeter. Manufacturers may use non-IEC designations for their products.

Because four cells in series produces a voltage range similar to 6 cells of lead-acids and their fire-resistant properties, they can be used to replace a 12 V lead-acid car battery.

This dry cell is commonly used in the UK for remote level crossing telephone handsets, where solar cells and rechargeable batteries have not been specified or retrofitted. These were formerly used in primary cell powered alarms (those without mains power) and associated bell ringing, servant or nurse call systems, ignition systems , telephones, [ 255 ] to improve voice quality on long lines to the local switch by increasing the off hook line voltage, impulse wound clocks (once a minute a mechanical movement pulses to advance electrically driven hands), and (in pairs) in WWII US Navy battle lanterns. Modern cells identified as alkaline may be one or more 'D' cells in a holder. The terminal posts are threaded 8–32 ( Unified Thread Standard ), insulated terminal nuts are normally provided, conical profile helical spring terminals are added for specific applications. Stamped and formed sheet metal spring terminals for bare wire connections (fahnestock clips) were supplied for use with telephones; e.g., the Western Electric 'Blue Bell' KS-6456 printed in blue ink on a grey paper and the Eveready 'Colombia Gray Label' printed in red ink on grey paper. +: centre; −: edge.

PP series [ edit ] The PP battery range The PP ( Power Pack ) series was manufactured by Ever Ready in the UK ( Eveready in the US). The series comprised multi-cell carbon-zinc batteries used for portable electronic devices. Most sizes are uncommon today; however, the PP3 size (and to a lesser extent PP8, used in electric fencing, and PP9) is readily available. [ 263 ] The PP4 was cylindrical; all the other types were rectangular. Most had snap terminals as seen on the common PP3 type. These came in two incompatible sizes, as is evident in some of the pictures below, those on larger, mostly older, battery types such as the PP9 being somewhat larger than those on the smaller batteries such as the PP3.
