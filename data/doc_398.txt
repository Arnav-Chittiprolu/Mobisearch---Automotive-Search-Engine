[ 2 ] With its reliable engine and dual Keihin carburetors, it became one of Honda's best-selling models. More than 250,000 were sold in five years, with 67,180 sold in 1972 alone. [ 3 ] The CB350 evolved during its production run with cosmetic changes and improvements to the suspension and brakes. Like its predecessor, the CB77 Superhawk , the CB350 was also offered in scrambler form, as the CL350 , with high-mounted exhausts and a 19-inch front wheel, and as the SL350 , with upswept exhausts and off-road styling. In 1974 the Honda CB360 twin replaced the CB350 but was only available for two years. Note: The four-cylinder CB350F , introduced in 1972, was a completely different model. In 2020 the Honda H'ness CB350 was released in India . [ 4 ] New generation [ edit ] On 30 September 2020, Honda launched the new CB350 with a new engine, new designs and new alloy wheels in India , through select Honda Dealerships. Deliveries of the Honda CB350 started on 17 October 2020. It also featured LED round headlights, dual horns, LED taillights, Bluetooth connectivity and a hazard light switch. It came with two variants: DLX and DLX Pro. Variants of the model were later launched in the UK, Australia, and Japan. [ 5 ] In those markets it is sold under model numbers beginning with GB350 rather than CB350. [ 6 ] On 16 November 2020, the Honda CB350 surpassed 1,000 deliveries in India.
