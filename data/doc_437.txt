The first generation K1200GT came out in 2003 and had a traditional “Brick” longitudinally mounted four cylinder engine. Criticisms of this model included its weight, lack of power, and poor ground clearance, but it still rated as a very comfortable and high-speed tourer. The second-generation K1200GT, introduced in 2006, uses essentially the same inline-4 engine as the BMW K1200S sportbike , which held the world speed record in 2005 for its class at 279.33 km/h (173.57 mph), [ 2 ] and the K1200R . The new model was lighter and more powerful than the 2003 first-generation K1200GT. [ 3 ] The K1200GT's standard equipment includes an adjustable seat and handlebars, integral ABS, dry sump lubrication, panniers, and electronically adjustable screen. Available options include: electronic suspension adjustment (ESA), xenon light, onboard computer including oil level warning, automatic stability control (ASC), heated seat, heated hand grips, tire pressure monitoring (TPM), cruise control and anti-theft alarm. K1300GT [ edit ] In late 2008, the K1200GT was replaced by the K1300GT, which had a 1,293 cc (78.9 cu in) larger displacement engine producing 160 bhp (120 kW) and 99 lb⋅ft (134 N⋅m) of torque at the crankshaft. [ 4 ] Cycle World tested the K1300GT at 105.2 kW (141.1 hp) and 86.0 lb⋅ft (116.6 N⋅m) torque at the rear wheel. [ 5 ] The new bike also had improved optional ESA-II [ clarification needed ] electronic suspension adjustment, a conventional single indicator switch and concealed crash bars.
