Shyr (CDO) Mark Stanton (CTO) Products Electric Vehicles Website human-horizons.com Human Horizons Technology was a Chinese electric car manufacturer company based in Shanghai that made electric cars under the HiPhi marque. [ 1 ] It operated a production and assembly smart plant in Yancheng , [ 2 ] Jiangsu , and its parts boutique prototype factory in Jinqiao , Shanghai . History [ edit ] Human Horizons was founded in August 2017 by Ding Lei . [ 3 ] The company's headquarters is in Shanghai. [ 4 ] The company was named the Human Horizons name on 25 October 2018, alongside three Human Horizons concept cars. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] On 31 July 2019, the HiPhi brand was launched alongside its first concept car, the HiPhi 1. [ 7 ] In September 2020, Human Horizons launched the HiPhi X, a luxury pure electric vehicle. [ 8 ] On 8 May 2021, HiPhi X began to be delivered to Chinese car owners. On November 6 of the same year, Chinese Horizon launched HiPhi Z. [ 9 ] On 31 March 2022, HiPhi Z GT was released. [ 10 ] In April 2023, the company's third model debuted, positioned below the flagship "X", a large crossover HiPhi Y . [ 11 ] In parallel, the company announced plans to start sales in Europe, starting with the "X" model. [ 12 ] In November 2023, the high-performance version of the flagship "Z" debuted under the name HiPhi A . [ 13 ] At the beginning of 2024, Human Horizons found itself in a difficult financial situation, which prompted the company's management to implement radical cost-cutting measures. In January, the company closed its two large showroom-style showrooms in Chengdu and Guangzhou , and also had to suspend all work of the research and development center. [ 14 ] A month later, Human Horizons officially confirmed that it was suspending all operations, starting from the development of new products, to the production of its current cars for the next 6 months. In addition, staff received salary cuts of up to 70% of their salary, encouraging staff to look for a new employer. [ 15 ] After an unsuccessful search for new owners, considering either selling shares or entering into cooperation within a joint venture , Human Horizons filed for bankruptcy in early August 2024.
