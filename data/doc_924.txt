It includes a drive-in theater and 75 V4 Supercharger stalls. [ 1 ] It opened on July 21, 2025. [ 2 ] History [ edit ] The Tesla Diner under construction in 2024 Elon Musk first announced the concept for the diner in 2018, [ 3 ] and in 2023 confirmed Tesla would build a diner in Los Angeles which he described as being " Grease meets Jetsons with Supercharging." [ 4 ] Tesla initially applied for a building permit at a lot located at 1401 Santa Monica Boulevard on the corner of 14th Street in Santa Monica. [ 5 ] In 2022, it was announced it would be located at the site of a former Shakey's Pizza in Hollywood. [ 6 ] The location is on the historic Route 66 . [ 7 ] The building was designed by the architecture firm Stantec . The silver two story building has a space age design in the shape of a flying saucer . [ 8 ] It features a restaurant, two movie screens, and charging stations for electric vehicles. [ 5 ] In March 2025, longtime Los Angeles chef Eric Greenspan was announced as the restaurant's head chef. [ 1 ] [ 9 ] Two weeks after opening, the restaurant reduced its menu to a smaller selection of items, and limited its 24-hour service only to those charging Tesla vehicles between the hours of midnight and 6 a.m. [ 10 ] On November 18, 2025, The Los Angeles Times reported that Greenspan has severed his ties with the restaurant, and that it will shift to a full-service restaurant model. [ 11 ] Reception [ edit ] Jennifer A. Kingson, writing in Axios , said the restaurant may serve as a national blueprint, starting a new retail category of charge-and-dine restaurants. [ 12 ] Gab Chabran, writing in LAist , said that Musk was looking to capitalize on the distinctive West Coast diner culture rooted in classic cars and cruising . [ 13 ] Matt Novak, writing in Gizmodo , said that "I hate that I love it. And I really wish anyone else but Musk was building it right now." [ 14 ] In July 2025, the diner attracted protestors opposing Musk's political views and involvement in the second Trump administration . [ 15 ] The attention brought to the diner has raised concerns among residents. [ 16 ] References [ edit ] ^ a b "L.A. chef picked to run Tesla diner in Hollywood" . Los Angeles Times .
