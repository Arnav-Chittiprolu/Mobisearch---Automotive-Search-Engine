OK is the primary direct-drive class in FIA championships . The class was originally called Intercontinental A ( ICA ), first introduced in 1981 at the European Championship as a secondary direct-drive class to Formula K . The class was first contested at the World Cup in 2006. In 2007—after 26 seasons of racing—ICA was replaced by KF2 and became the primary class in 2010, replacing KF1 at the World Championship . The KF2 class was renamed to KF upon the demise of KF1 in 2013, and was replaced by OK regulations in 2016. OK is contested as the primary direct-drive class at the Karting World Championship and the Karting European Championship . History [ edit ] Intercontinental A (1981–2006) [ edit ] In 1981, Intercontinental A (ICA) was introduced alongside Formula K as a secondary direct-drive class for the European Championship . Stefano Modena completed back-to-back ICA European Championships in 1984, a feat that would not be repeated until Andrea Kimi Antonelli under OK regulations in 2021. The ICA World Cup was introduced in 2006, the final year of ICA regulations, won by French driver Mike Courquin. KF2/KF (2007–2015) [ edit ] In January 2007, the CIK-FIA decided to replace the 100 cc water-cooled two-stroke ICA engines with 125 cc Touch-and-Go (TaG) water-cooled two-stroke KF2 engines, producing 34–36 hp (25–27 kW). Now the secondary class to KF1 —which had replaced Formula A —the KF2 class karts used hand-operated front brakes via a lever. The chassis had to be CIK-approved, with a minimum weight of 160 kg and 158 kg for national and international events, respectively. KF2 karts were equipped with an electric starter and a centrifugal clutch . The engine was limited to 15,000 rpm . In 2010, karts of the KF2 category were mandated at the Karting World Championship as the primary direct-drive category, alongside the European Championship, replacing KF1 in both. [ 1 ] KF1 returned to the World Championship in 2011 and 2012, reverting KF2 back to World Cup status, but met its demise at the end of the 2012 season. With the end of KF1 regulations, KF2 became known as simply KF and returned to the World Championship as the primary class once more. Original Kart (2016–present) [ edit ] In 2016, Original Kart (OK) regulations replaced KF in the direct-drive category, after its perceived failure within the kart racing community and restrictive regulations resulted in reduced entries at international competitions. [ 2 ] OK karts had much of the electronics removed, and had to be push-started. Specification [ edit ] Original Kart (OK) [ edit ] There are eight main technical features of the OK regulations: [ 3 ] 125 cc direct-coupled, water-cooled two-stroke , mixed-lubrication engine. Valve inlet in the piston skirt. Screw carburettor with a maximum diameter of 24 mm. Maximum speed ( limiter ) of 16,000 rpm . Power valve at the exhaust. Single rear brake with hydraulic control. Premium tyres, medium gum compound . Minimum weight 150 kg, driver included. Engines, chassis, bodywork, brakes and tyres are subject to the homologation system put in place by the CIK-FIA. Each year, the tyres and the fuel for each category, as well as the KZ and KZ2 carburettor, are chosen after a call for tenders.
