In 1872, [[George Brayton|George Bailey Brayton]] obtained a patent on an internal combustion engine that used a pneumatic fuel injection system, also invented by Brayton: [[air-blast injection]].<ref>Sass</ref>{{refpage|p=413}} In 1894, [[Rudolf Diesel]] copied Brayton's air-blast injection system for the diesel engine, but also improved it.<ref>Sass</ref>{{refpage|p=414}} He increased the air blast pressure from {{cvt|4-5|kp/cm2|kPa psi|order=out}} to {{cvt|65|kp/cm2|kPa psi|order=out}}.<ref>Sass</ref>{{refpage|p=415}} In the meantime, the first manifold injection system was designed by Johannes Spiel in 1884, while working at ''Hallesche Maschinenfabrik'' in Germany.<ref>Richard van Basshuysen (ed.): ''Ottomotor mit Direkteinspritzung und Direkteinblasung: Ottokraftstoffe, Erdgas, Methan, Wasserstoff'', 4th edition, Springer, Wiesbaden 2017, {{ISBN|978-3-658-12215-7}}, p. 6</ref> 

In 1891, the British [[Herbert_Akroyd_Stuart#Hornsby-Akroyd_engine|Herbert-Akroyd oil engine]] became the first engine to use a pressurised fuel injection system.<ref name=rwallis>{{Ransome-Wallis Encyclopedia | page = 27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=A Biographical Dictionary of People in Engineering: From Earliest Records to 2000|last=Hall|first=Carl W.|publisher=Purdue University Press|year=2008|edition=1st|via=Credo Reference}}</ref> This design, called a [[hot-bulb engine]] used a 'jerk pump' to dispense [[fuel oil]] at high pressure to an injector.

The pre-combustion chamber made it feasible to produce engines in size suitable for automobiles and [[MAN Truck & Bus]] presented the first direct-injected diesel engine for trucks in 1924.<ref name="von Fersen_130">von Fersen (ed.), p. 130</ref> Higher pressure diesel injection pumps were introduced by [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] in 1927.

In 1898, German company [[Deutz AG]] started producing four-stroke petrol [[stationary engine]]s<ref name="Cummins_1971">{{cite journal |last1=Cummins, Jr. |first1=C.

=== 1940s–1950s: WWII aircraft and early direct-injection petrol engines ===
During [[World War II]], several petrol engines for aircraft used direct-injection systems, such as the European [[Junkers Jumo 210]], [[Daimler-Benz DB 601]], [[BMW 801]], and the [[Shvetsov ASh-82|Shvetsov ASh-82FN (M-82FN)]]. The German direct-injection systems were based on diesel injection systems used by Bosch, Deckel, Junkers and l'Orange.<ref>Richard van Basshuysen (ed.): ''Ottomotor mit Direkteinspritzung und Direkteinblasung: Ottokraftstoffe, Erdgas, Methan, Wasserstoff'', 4th edition, Springer, Wiesbaden 2017, {{ISBN|978-3-658-12215-7}}, p. 10</ref> By around 1943, the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin]] and [[Wright R-3350]] had switched from traditional carburettors to fuel-injection (called "pressure carburettors" at the time), however these engines used throttle body [[#Manifold injection|manifold injection]], rather than the direct-injection systems of the German engines. From 1940, the [[Mitsubishi Kinsei|Mitsubishi Kinsei 60 series]] engine used a direct-injection system, along with the related [[Mitsubishi Kasei]] engine from 1941. In 1943, a low-pressure fuel injection system was added to the [[Nakajima Homare|Nakajima Homare Model 23]] radial engine.<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://saemobilus.sae.org/content/881610/ |title=Engine Fuels and Lubrication Systems at Nakajima Aircraft Co. from 1936–1945 [sic] |first1=Ryoichi |last1=Nakagawa |first2=Sotaro |last2=Mizutani |year=1988 |doi=10.4271/881610 |journal=Mobilus |series=SAE Technical Paper Series |volume=1 |publisher=Society of Automobile Engineers |location=US |issn=0148-7191 |eissn=2688-3627 |url-access=subscription}}</ref>

The first mass-produced petrol direct-injection system was developed by Bosch and initially used in small automotive two-stroke petrol engines. Introduced in the 1950 [[Goliath GP700]] small saloon, it was also added to the [[Gutbrod Superior]] engine in 1952. This mechanically controlled system was essentially a specially lubricated high-pressure diesel direct-injection pump of the type that is governed by the vacuum behind an intake throttle valve.<ref>Richard van Basshuysen (ed.): ''Ottomotor mit Direkteinspritzung und Direkteinblasung: Ottokraftstoffe, Erdgas, Methan, Wasserstoff'', 4th edition, Springer, Wiesbaden 2017, {{ISBN|978-3-658-12215-7}}, p. 19</ref> A Bosch mechanical direct-injection system was also used in the straight-eight used in the 1954 [[Mercedes-Benz W196]] Formula One racing car. The first four-stroke direct-injection petrol engine for a passenger car was released the following year, in the [[Mercedes-Benz 300SL]] sports car.<ref>Richard van Basshuysen (ed.): ''Ottomotor mit Direkteinspritzung und Direkteinblasung: Ottokraftstoffe, Erdgas, Methan, Wasserstoff'', 4th edition, Springer, Wiesbaden 2017, {{ISBN|978-3-658-12215-7}}, p. 20</ref> However the engine suffered lubrication problems due to petrol diluting the engine oil,<ref>{{cite web |title=Mercedes-Benz 300 SL |url=https://jalopnik.com/mercedes-benz-300-sl-309046 |website=www.jalopnik.com |access-date=26 December 2022 |language=en |date=10 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=Driving the Awesome Mercedes 300 SL 'Gullwing'{{dash}}slide 8/22 |url=https://www.wired.com/2011/01/driving-the-awesome-mercedes-300-sl-gullwing/ |magazine=Wired |access-date=26 December 2022 |last1=Smith |first1=Sam }}</ref> and subsequent Mercedes-Benz engines switched to a manifold injection design. Likewise, most petrol injection systems prior to the 2000s used the less-expensive manifold injection design.

Throughout the 1950s, several manufacturers introduced their manifold injection systems for petrol engines. [[Lucas Industries]] had begun developing a fuel injection system in 1941 and by 1956 it was used in the Jaguar racing cars.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lucasinjection.com/HISTORY.htm |title=A short history of Lucas injection |publisher=lucasinjection.com |access-date=2015-05-01}}</ref> At the [[1957 24 Hours of Le Mans]], the 1st to 4th placed cars were [[Jaguar D-Type]] entries using a Lucas fuel injection system.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lucas Le Mans 1957 |url=https://www.lucasinjection.com/lucaslemas1957.jpg |website=www.lucasinjection.com |access-date=25 December 2022}}</ref> Also in 1957, General Motors introduced the [[Rochester Ramjet]] option, consisting of a fuel injection system for the V8 engine in the Chevrolet Corvette. During the 1960s, fuel injection systems were also produced by [[Stuart Hilborn|Hilborn]],<ref name="howgood">{{cite journal |last=Walton |first=Harry |title=How Good is Fuel Injection? |journal=Popular Science |date=March 1957 |volume=170 |issue=3 |pages=88–93 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=byEDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA88 |access-date=2015-05-01}}</ref> [[SPICA]]<ref>{{Cite web |title=Spica Fuel Injection |url=https://www.hemmings.com/stories/article/spica-fuel-injection |access-date=2023-10-30 |website=www.hemmings.com}}</ref> and [[Kugelfischer]].

Up until this time, the fuel injection systems had used a mechanical control system. In 1957, the American [[Bendix Electrojector]] system was introduced, which used analogue electronics for the control system. The Electrojector was intended to be available for the [[Rambler Rebel]] mid-size car, however reliability problems meant that the fuel injection option was not offered.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60C16FD355A137A93C6AB1788D85F438585F9 |last=Ingraham |first=Joseph C. |title=Automobiles: Races; Everybody Manages to Win Something at the Daytona Beach Contests |newspaper=The New York Times |date=1957-03-24 |page=153 |access-date=2015-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=Consumer Reports |year=1957 |volume=22 |title=1957 cars |page=154}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Aird |first=Forbes |title=Bosch fuel injection systems |publisher=HP Trade |year=2001 |page=29 |isbn=978-1-55788-365-0}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.petersen.org/default.cfm?docid=1034 |first=Leslie |last=Kendall |title=American Musclecars: Power to the People |publisher=Petersen Automotive Museum |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20111027060937/http://www.petersen.org/default.cfm?docid=1034 |archive-date=2011-10-27 |access-date=2022-03-13}}</ref><ref name="auto.howstuffworks.com">{{cite web |url= http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-rambler-rebel2.htm |title=Rambler Measures Up |website=How Stuff Works |date=2007-08-22 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20200729153245/http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1957-1960-rambler-rebel2.htm |archive-date=2020-07-29 |access-date=2022-03-13}}</ref> In 1958, the [[Chrysler 300 letter series#1958 300D|Chrysler 300D]], [[DeSoto Adventurer]], [[1958 Dodge#D-500|Dodge D-500]] and [[Plymouth Fury]] offered the Electrojector system, becoming the first cars known to use an electronic fuel injection (EFI) system.<ref name="1958DeSoto">{{cite web |title=1958 Chrysler-DeSoto Electrojector - World's First Electronic Fuel Injection|last1=Mattar|first1=George|url= https://www.allpar.com/cars/desoto/electrojector.html |website=Allpar|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>

The Electrojector patents were subsequently sold to Bosch, who developed the Electrojector into the Bosch [[D-Jetronic]].<ref>{{cite web |title=D-Jetronic History and Fundamentals |url=http://members.rennlist.com/pbanders/djetfund.htm |website=www.rennlist.com |access-date=26 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809110201/http://members.rennlist.com/pbanders/djetfund.htm |archive-date=9 August 2010 |url-status=live}}</ref> The D-Jetronic was produced from 1967-1976 and first used on the [[Volkswagen Type 3|VW 1600TL/E]]. The system was a speed/density system, using engine speed and intake manifold air density to calculate the amount of fuel to be injected. In 1974, Bosch introduced the [[K-Jetronic]] system, which used a continuous flow of fuel from the injectors (rather than the pulsed flow of the D-Jetronic system). K-Jetronic was a mechanical injection system, using a plunger actuated by the intake manifold pressure which then controlled the fuel flow to the injectors.<ref name="von Fersen_256">Olaf von Fersen (ed.): ''Ein Jahrhundert Automobiltechnik. Personenwagen'', VDI-Verlag, Düsseldorf 1986, {{ISBN|978-3-642-95773-4}}. p. 256</ref> 

Also in 1974, Bosch introduced the [[L-Jetronic]] system, a pulsed flow system which used an [[Mass_flow_sensor#Moving_vane_meter|air flow meter]] to calculate the amount of fuel required. L-Jetronic was widely adopted on European cars during the 1970s and 1980s. As a system that uses electronically controlled fuel injectors which open and close to control the amount of fuel entering the engine, the L-Jetronic system uses the same basic principles as modern electronic fuel injection (EFI) systems.

=== 1980s–present: digital electronics and common-rail injection===
Prior to 1979, the electronics in fuel injection systems used [[analogue electronics]] for the control system. The [[Motronic|Bosch Motronic]] multi-point fuel injection system (also amongst the first systems where the [[ignition system]] is controlled by the same device as the fuel injection system) was the first mass-produced system to use [[digital electronics]]. The [[Ford EEC#EEC-III|Ford EEC-III]] single-point fuel injection system, introduced in 1980, was another early digital fuel injection system.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.motorola.com/staticfiles/Consumers/Corporate/US-EN/_Documents/Motorola_History_Timeline.pdf |title=A Timeline Overview of Motorola History 1928-2009 |publisher=Motorola |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110620224820/http://www.motorola.com/staticfiles/Consumers/Corporate/US-EN/_Documents/Motorola_History_Timeline.pdf |archive-date=2011-06-20 |access-date=2014-01-20}}</ref><ref name="von Fersen_262">Olaf von Fersen (ed.): ''Ein Jahrhundert Automobiltechnik. Personenwagen'', VDI-Verlag, Düsseldorf 1986, {{ISBN|978-3-642-95773-4}}. p. 262</ref> These and other electronic manifold injection systems (using either [[#Multi-point injection|port injection]] or [[#Single-point injection|throttle-body injection]]) became more widespread through the 1980s, and by the early 1990s they had replaced carburettors in most new petrol-engined cars sold in developed countries.

The aforementioned injection systems for petrol passenger car engines{{dash}}except for the 1954–1959 ''Mercedes-Benz 300&nbsp;SL''{{dash}}all used [[#Manifold injection|manifold injection]] (i.e. the injectors located at the intake ports or throttle body, instead of inside the combustion chamber). This began to change when the first mass-produced [[petrol direct injection]] system for passenger cars was a [[common rail]] system introduced in the 1997 [[Mitsubishi_6G7_engine#6G74|Mitsubishi 6G74]] V6 engine.<ref>Richard van Basshuysen (ed.): ''Ottomotor mit Direkteinspritzung und Direkteinblasung: Ottokraftstoffe, Erdgas, Methan, Wasserstoff'', 4th edition, Springer, Wiesbaden 2017, {{ISBN|978-3-658-12215-7}}, p. 138</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Mitsubishi Motors Adds World First V6 3.5-liter GDI Engine to Ultra-efficiency GDI Series |url= http://media.mitsubishi-motors.com/pressrelease/e/corporate/detail215.html |website=mitsubishi-motors.com |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091001184522/http://media.mitsubishi-motors.com/pressrelease/e/corporate/detail215.html |archive-date=1 October 2009 }} [https://www.3si.org/threads/direct-gas-injection-any-one-tried.477519/ Alt URL]</ref> The first common-rail system for a passenger car diesel engine was the [[Fiat_JTD_engine#1.9|Fiat Multijet]]{{Broken anchor|date=2024-07-03|bot=User:Cewbot/log/20201008/configuration|target_link=Fiat_JTD_engine#1.9|reason= The anchor (1.9) [[Special:Diff/1231054680|has been deleted]].}} straight-four engine,<ref>Günter P.

Since the 2010s, many petrol engines have switched to direct-injection (sometimes in combination with separate manifold injectors for each cylinder). Similarly, many modern diesel engines use a common-rail design.

[[Stratified charge]] injection was used in several petrol engines in the early 2000s, such as the [[List_of_discontinued_Volkswagen_Group_petrol_engines#1.4_R4:_FSI_63-77kW|Volkswagen 1.4 FSI engine]] introduced in 2000. However, the stratified charge systems were largely no longer in use by the late 2010s, due to increased exhaust emissions of {{NOx}} gasses and particulates, along with the increased cost and complexity of the systems.
