Sophia B wikiHow Staff 08/07/25 5:34pm Calling all Rick Riordan fans! Let's settle the great Percy vs. Jason debate once and for all. In case you need a refresher, Perseus 'Percy' Jackson is protagonist of Percy Jackson and the Olympians . Percy is a Greek demigod and the son of Poseidon (the Greek god of the sea) and Sally Jackson. He was trained to fight by Chiron at Camp Half Blood. Percy can manipulate water and currents, can breathe underwater, has enhanced strength and senses when near water, and can communicate with sea animals. His primary weapon is the shape-shifting sword, Riptide. Jason Grace is the protagonist in The Heroes of Olympus . Jason is a Roman demigod and the son of Jupiter (the Roman god of the sky and thunder) and Ms. Grace. He was trained to fight by Lupa at the Wolf House of Camp Jupiter. He can generate lightning and manipuate weather as well as air spirits. His weapons include the legendary sword, Gladius, as well as Ivlivs, a golden coin that turns to a sword on 'heads' and a javelin on 'tails.' Who would win in a battle between Percy and Jason?

WikiFawnSlinger927 12/17/24 1:10pm Are there any tricks to winning the lottery? I mostly play scratch-offs and stuff like that, but I’m beginning to wonder if there are any games or strategies I should know about. I always kind of thought it was just random, but I know a guy who swears by this thing where he buys tickets at a certain time? I don’t know. What’s the deal? Are there strategies or no? 1850 readers have voted on this topic. Poll was last updated on 12/29/25.
