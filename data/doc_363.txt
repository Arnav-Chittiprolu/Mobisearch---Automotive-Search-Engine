[ 1 ] The new global family is designed to improve fuel economy , performance, and emissions , while reducing noise and vibrations. To achieve this, it features a lightweight design and advanced technologies like gasoline direct injection , turbocharging , variable-length intake manifolds , and alternative fuel compatibility. It uses a modular approach with interchangeable components that can be suited to specific applications. The SGE has been available in the following displacements: 999 cc (1.0 L; 61.0 cu in) I3 DI DCVCP turbo 77.4 mm (3.05 in) stroke, 1,118 cc (1.1 L; 68.2 cu in) I3 PFI 86.6 mm (3.41 in) stroke, 1,399 cc (1.4 L; 85.4 cu in) I4 DI DCVCP turbo 81.3 mm (3.20 in) stroke, and 1,490 cc (1.5 L; 90.9 cu in) I4 PFI 86.6 mm (3.41 in) stroke All engines share a common block design (depending on the number of cylinders) and a 74 mm (2.91 in) bore with 81 mm (3.19 in) bore spacing. The one-stage single-scroll turbocharger in turbocharged variants is supplied by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries . [ 2 ] To reduce noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH) levels, the direct injection fuel rail mounts to the cylinder head and valve cover via bushings that isolate the loud ticking noise that injector pintles make. GM claims that the 1.0-liter turbo is 25 percent (3 dBA ) quieter than the Ford Fiesta's 1.0-liter turbo, and the 1.4-liter is up to 50 percent (6 dBA) quieter than the VW/Audi 1.4-liter turbo. Other silencing measures include a bed-plate cylinder block that increases stiffness and a stiffened aluminum front cam cover. Three-cylinder variants get a balance shaft that is integrated with the oil pump and located inside the two-piece aluminum oil pan to prevent radiated noise. The shaft counter-rotates at engine speed. GM claims that the EcoTec three-cylinder idles more smoothly than Ford's three-cylinder, which does not use a shaft. [ 2 ] All turbocharged variants provide 90 percent of their maximum torque between 1500 and 5000 rpm, with peak power arriving between 5600 and 6000 rpm. The MHI turbochargers are sized to provide quick torque response, and are mounted very close to the cylinders, thanks to cylinder heads that incorporate the exhaust manifolds in the head. [ 2 ] To reduce mass, the engines are compact in all directions, made almost entirely of aluminum, and feature composite intake manifolds. This removes 44 pounds (20 kg) from the previous 1.4-liter turbo in the Cruze and makes it 8 pounds (4 kg) lighter than the 1.4-liter VW turbo. GM says this engine weighs 216 pounds (98 kg), ready for installation. [ 2 ] The engines debuted in the 2014 Opel Adam [ 3 ] and were first produced in Szentgotthárd , Hungary. [ 4 ] They have also been produced in Changwon , South Korea; Toluca , Mexico; Spring Hill, Tennessee ; Flint, Michigan ; [ 5 ] and Shanghai , China. By 2018, the new engine family had spread to other brands and markets, replacing three separate engine families ( S-TEC , Family 0 , and Family 1 ). The assembly lines for North American facilities were manufactured by Hirata Corporation at its powertrain facility in Kumamoto , Japan.
