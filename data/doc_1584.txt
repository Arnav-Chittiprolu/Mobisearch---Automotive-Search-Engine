This specific powertrain features all-wheel drive. In a motor vehicle , the powertrain comprises the main components that generate power and deliver that power to the road surface, water, or air. This includes the engine , transmission , drive shafts , differentials , and the final drive ( drive wheels , continuous track as in military tanks or caterpillar tractors, propeller , etc.). Hybrid powertrains also include one or more electric traction motors that operate to drive the vehicle wheels.  All-electric vehicles ("electric cars") eliminate the engine altogether, relying solely on electric motors for propulsion. Occasionally the term powerplant is casually used to refer to the engine or, less often, the entire powertrain. A motor vehicle's driveline or drivetrain consists of the parts of the powertrain excluding the engine. It is the portion of a vehicle, after the prime mover , that changes depending on whether a vehicle is front-wheel , rear-wheel , or four-wheel drive , or less-common six-wheel or eight-wheel drive . In a wider sense, [ compared to? ] the powertrain includes all of the components used to transform stored (chemical, solar, nuclear, kinetic, potential, etc.) energy into kinetic energy for propulsion purposes. This includes the utilization of multiple power-sources and non–wheel-based vehicles. Developments [ edit ] The most recent developments in powertrain are driven by the electrification of it in multiple components. Electrical energy needs to be provided, usually this leads to larger batteries. Electric motors can be found as isolated components or as part of other elements, e.g. the axle . In hybrid powertrains the torque generated by the combustion engine and the electric motor have to be brought together and distributed to the wheels. The control of this process can be quite involved but the rewards are greatly improved acceleration and much lower emissions. Powertrain development for diesel engines involves the following: exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), and advanced combustion. Spark ignition engine development include: fuel injection , including the gasoline direct injection variant, as well as improving volumetric efficiency by using multi-valves per cylinder, variable valve timing , variable length intake manifolds , and turbocharging . Changes also include new fuel qualities (no sulphur or aromates ) to allow new combustion concepts. So-called "combined combustion systems" (CCV) or "diesotto" cycles are based on synthetic fuels (synthetic diesel, biomass to liquid (BTL) or gas to liquid (GTL)). [ 1 ] BEVs , FCEVs and PHEV powertrains are expected to reach cost parity with ICE powertrains in 2025. [ 2 ] Key Components [ edit ] This section may incorporate text from a large language model .

( September 2025 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) The powertrain of a vehicle refers to the collection of components that generate power and deliver it to the wheels, enabling the vehicle to move. Powertrains can vary significantly between conventional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, hybrid vehicles (HEVs), and electric vehicles (EVs). Regardless of the type, the powertrain remains one of the most critical systems in any vehicle. * Engine: The engine is the heart of the powertrain in conventional ICE vehicles. It converts fuel, such as gasoline or diesel, into mechanical energy through the process of combustion. Engines come in various forms, including internal combustion engines, which are the most common, and electric motors, which are predominant in EVs. Hybrid vehicles often combine both systems to maximize fuel efficiency and reduce emissions. Each engine type has its unique design and operational characteristics, but all aim to produce the torque required to propel the vehicle. * Electric Motor and Inverter: In electric vehicles, the electric motor replaces the traditional engine, converting electrical energy into mechanical energy to drive the wheels. This motor is highly efficient and eliminates the need for some of the more complex components found in ICE vehicles, such as exhaust systems or fuel tanks. Inverters are critical in EVs, as they control the motor's performance by regulating power output and enabling variable speeds. Together, the motor and inverter form the backbone of the electric powertrain. * Transmission: The transmission is responsible for transferring mechanical energy from the engine or motor to the drivetrain. It ensures that the power generated by the engine is delivered to the wheels in the most efficient manner, adjusting for speed and load. There are several types of transmissions, including manual transmissions, where the driver shifts gears; automatic transmissions, which shift gears automatically; continuously variable transmissions (CVTs), which offer seamless acceleration; and dual-clutch transmissions (DCTs), known for their rapid gear changes and improved performance. * Control Units: Modern powertrains are heavily dependent on electronic control units (ECUs) or powertrain control modules (PCMs). These systems monitor and optimize the performance of the engine, transmission, and other components. By analyzing data from sensors throughout the vehicle, ECUs ensure the powertrain operates at peak efficiency while also complying with emissions and performance standards. Control units are essential for advanced features like adaptive driving modes and predictive maintenance. * Drivetrain: The drivetrain is the system that connects the transmission to the wheels, distributing power as needed. It includes key components such as the driveshaft, which transfers rotational power, the differential, which allows the wheels to rotate at different speeds for smoother cornering, and the axles, which deliver power directly to the wheels. The drivetrain configuration varies by vehicle type, with common setups being front-wheel drive (FWD), rear-wheel drive (RWD), and all-wheel drive (AWD) or four-wheel drive (4WD), each offering distinct advantages depending on the application. Manufacturing [ edit ] The manufacturing of powertrain components and systems is important to industry, including the automotive and other vehicle sectors. Competitiveness drives companies to engineer and produce powertrain systems that over time are more economical to manufacture, higher in product quality and reliability, higher in performance, more fuel efficient, less polluting, and longer in life expectancy. In turn these requirements have led to designs involving higher internal pressures, greater instantaneous forces, and increased complexity of design and mechanical operation. The resulting designs in turn impose significantly more severe requirements on parts shape and dimension; and material surface flatness , waviness , roughness , and porosity . Quality control over these parameters is achieved through metrology technology applied to all of the steps in powertrain manufacturing processes. Frames and powertrains [ edit ] In automotive manufacturing, the frame plus the "running gear" makes the chassis . Later, a body (sometimes referred to as " coachwork "), which is usually not necessary for integrity of the structure, is built on the chassis to complete the vehicle . Commercial vehicle manufacturers may have "chassis only" and "cowl and chassis" versions that can be outfitted with specialized bodies. These include buses , motor homes , fire engines , ambulances , etc. The frame plus the body makes a glider (a vehicle without a powertrain). Final drive [ edit ] A cutaway view of an automotive final drive unit, which contains the differential The final drive is the last in the set of components which delivers torque to the drive wheels . In a road vehicle, it incorporates the differential . In a railway vehicle, it sometimes incorporates the reversing gear. Examples include the Self-Changing Gears RF 28 (used in many first-generation diesel multiple units of British Railways ) [ 3 ] and RF 11 used in the British Rail Class 03 and British Rail Class 04 diesel shunting locomotives. Variations [ edit ] This section uses infographics to show a unified model with variations, the green wheels denote no traction, and the angled wheels denote steering. 6X4 means 6 wheel ends and 4 positions distribute power (power divider installed) 6X2 means 6 wheel ends and 2 positions distribute power (single axle drive) 4X0 means 4 wheel ends no power (Trailer axle) 4x2 means 4 Wheel ends, 2 Positions to distribute power The 6 wheel ends can either be wide base singles or duals.
