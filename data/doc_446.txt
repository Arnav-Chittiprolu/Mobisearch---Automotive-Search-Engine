BMW began production of motorcycle engines and then motorcycles after World War I.<ref name="artof">Peter Gantriis, Henry Von Wartenberg. "The Art of BMW: 85 Years of Motorcycling Excellence". MotorBooks International, September 2008, p. 10.</ref> Its motorcycle brand is now known as [[BMW Motorrad]]. Their first successful motorcycle after the failed Helios and Flink, was the "[[BMW R32|R32]]" in 1923, though production originally began in 1921.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reference.com/vehicles/history-bmw-motorcycles-usa-5e17ca6bfcbc7a67?qo=cdpArticles|title=What is the history of BMW motorcycles in the USA?|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170824225728/https://www.reference.com/vehicles/history-bmw-motorcycles-usa-5e17ca6bfcbc7a67?qo=cdpArticles|archive-date=24 August 2017|access-date=6 May 2017}}</ref> This had a "[[Flat-twin engine|boxer]]" twin engine, in which a cylinder projects into the air-flow from each side of the machine. Apart from their single-cylinder models (basically to the same pattern), all their motorcycles used this distinctive layout until the early 1980s. Many BMW's are still produced in this layout, which is designated the [[History of BMW motorcycles#R series|R Series]].

The entire BMW Motorcycle production line has, since 1969, been located at the company's Berlin-Spandau factory.

During the Second World War, BMW produced the [[BMW R75]] motorcycle with a motor-driven [[sidecar]] attached. Combined with a lockable [[differential (mechanics)|differential]], the vehicle was very capable off-road.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|title=R75WH|date=30 November 2018|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200204163429/http://www.vintagebmw.org/v7/model/r75wh|archive-date=4 February 2020|access-date=4 February 2020}}</ref>

In 1982 came the [[BMW K1200S|K Series]], with a shaft drive but water-cooled and with either three or four cylinders mounted in a straight line from front to back. Shortly after, BMW also started making the chain-driven [[History of BMW motorcycles#F series|F]] and [[History of BMW motorcycles#G series|G]] series with single and parallel twin [[Rotax]] engines.

In the early 1990s, BMW updated the [[airhead (motorcycle)|airhead]] Boxer engine which became known as the [[oilhead]]. In 2002, the oilhead engine had two spark plugs per cylinder. In 2004 it added a built-in balance shaft, an increased capacity to {{convert|1170|cc|0|abbr=on}} and enhanced performance to {{cvt|75|kW|0}} for the [[BMW R1200GS|R1200GS]], compared to {{cvt|63|kW|0}} of the previous [[BMW R1150GS|R1150GS]]. More powerful variants of the oilhead engines are available in the R1100S and R1200S, producing {{cvt|73|and|91|kW|0}}, respectively.

In 2004, BMW introduced the new K1200S Sports Bike which marked a departure for BMW. It had an engine producing {{cvt|125|kW|0}}, derived from the company's work with the Williams F1 team, and is lighter than previous K models. Innovations include electronically adjustable front and rear suspension, and a Hossack-type front fork that BMW calls Duolever.

BMW introduced [[anti-lock braking system|anti-lock brakes]] on production motorcycles starting in the late 1980s. The generation of anti-lock brakes available on the 2006 and later BMW motorcycles paved the way for the introduction of [[electronic stability control]], or anti-skid technology later in the 2007 model year.

BMW has been an innovator in motorcycle suspension design, taking up telescopic front suspension long before most other manufacturers. Then they switched to an [[Earles fork]], front suspension by swinging fork (1955 to 1969). Most modern BMWs are truly rear swingarm, single sided at the back (compare with the regular swinging fork usually, and wrongly, called [[swinging arm]]). Some BMWs started using yet another trademark front suspension design, the Telelever, in the early 1990s. Like the Earles fork, the Telelever significantly reduces dive under braking.<ref>{{Cite web |title=BMW Telelever Explained |url=https://www.motorbikestoday.com/features/Articles/bmw_telelever.htm#:~:text=Technically%20the%20Telelever%20can%20be,one%20shock-spring-unit. |access-date=2025-01-14 |website=www.motorbikestoday.com}}</ref>

BMW Group, on 31 January 2013, announced that Pierer Industrie AG has bought [[Husqvarna Motorcycles]] for an undisclosed amount, which will not be revealed by either party in the future. The company is headed by Stephan Pierer (CEO of KTM). Pierer Industrie AG is 51% owner of KTM and 100% owner of Husqvarna.

In September 2018, BMW unveiled a new self-driving motorcycle with BMW Motorrad with a goal of using the technology to help improve road safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|title=BMW made a self-driving motorcycle|last=O'Kane|first=Sean|date=12 September 2018|website=The Verge|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190601162414/https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/12/17847508/bmw-motorrad-self-driving-motorcycle|archive-date=1 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> The design of the [[Motorcycle|bike]] was inspired by the company's [[BMW R1200GS|BMW R1200 GS]] model.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|title=BMW Unveils The First Driverless Motorcycle|last=Su|first=Jean Baptiste|date=14 September 2018|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=30 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190530120611/https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/09/14/bmw-unveils-the-first-driverless-motorcycle/|archive-date=30 May 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Edit summary (Briefly describe your changes) By publishing changes, you agree to the Terms of Use , and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and the GFDL .
