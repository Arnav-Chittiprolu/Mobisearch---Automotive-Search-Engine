[ 24 ] [ 25 ] Japanese models include standard 7-speed S tronic transmission for all models. Equipment [ edit ] Interior Harman/Becker Automotive Systems produced Audi's new updated Multi Media Interface (MMI) technology for Q5. The new system includes navigation, communication, and wide-screen entertainment. A three-dimensional orientation view with true-to-scale terrain and photo realistic depictions of key landmarks will also be generated. Included features in this new system are USB storage media ( iPod or MP3), satellite radio , and an integral four-band GSM mobile/cell phone (SIM card ready) with Bluetooth connectivity. S line package includes 20-inch S line wheels, headlight washers , sport steering wheels with shift paddles , brushed aluminium inlays, S line aluminium door sills, and a black headliner. The Offroad exterior package includes front and rear underbody protection panels, along with flared fender and door sill protection. Carrying and towing capabilities [ edit ] A sensor informs the ESP system if a roof rack has been mounted, which will cause the Audi Q5's centre of gravity to be shifted higher in keeping with the roof load of up to 100 kg (220 lb). If a roof rack is present, the ESP engages earlier in the handling limit. Without a roof load, the driver is free to tap the full dynamic potential of the Audi Q5. The Audi Q5 is capable of towing up to 2.0 tonnes; the standard hill descent control system makes it safe to navigate down steep inclines by regulating the preselected speed when driving at under 30 km/h (19 mph). The Q5 is also fitted with an advanced Trailer Stability Program designed to combat any unwanted snaking when towing a large trailer or caravan. Production [ edit ] The new vehicle was expected to be built in Audi's home town of Ingolstadt . An investment of €300 million in production tooling and expansion was expected. [ 26 ] In September 2016, Audi has opened a factory with a capacity of 150,000 Q5 in San José Chiapa (Mexico). [ 27 ] [ 28 ] 2012 facelift [ edit ] Main changes include a redesigned set of front and rear light configuration, and a new set of engines that increase both output and efficiency. Most interior user controls have narrow chrome trim. Ergonomics changes include 4-button MMI navigation plus system, additional skip function for volume dial. Large fabric-upholstered surfaces are standard on the door trim panels; inlay options include three wood veneers and one aluminium version. The vehicles went on sale in summer 2012. Early models include 2.0 TFSI hybrid quattro, 2.0 TFSI quattro (225PS), 3.0 TFSI quattro (272PS), 2.0 TDI (143PS), 2.0 TDI quattro (177PS), 3.0 TDI quattro (245PS). [ 29 ] [ 30 ] In Germany, 2.0 TFSI quattro (180PS), 2.0 TDI (150PS), 2.0 TDI quattro (150PS) were added in 2013, with 2.0 TDI (150PS) replacing 2.0 TDI (143PS). [ 31 ] Pre-facelift styling Front Rear Post-facelift styling Front Rear SQ5 TDI (2013–) [ edit ] Audi SQ5 TDI The SQ5 performance crossover SUV is the first Audi S model vehicle to feature a diesel engine. The primary power plant is a 3.0 L (2,967 cc), twin turbocharged V6 engine coupled to an 8-speed Tiptronic transmission, developing 313 PS at 3,900–4,500 rpm, and 650 N⋅m (479 lbf⋅ft) of torque at 1,450–2,800 rpm. It also features Audi's signature quattro permanent all-wheel drive system with torque vectoring transfer. Sport suspension lowers the vehicle body by 30 mm (1.18 in) and 20-inch 5 parallel-spoke wheels with 255/45 tires are fitted as standard, with the option of upgrading to 21-inch wheels. Other features of the SQ5 are black front brake callipers with Audi 'S' badges, an optional Audi drive select system, a platinum-grey single-frame grille with galvanized double bars, two SQ5 unique body colours (Estoril Blue or Panther Black), optional lunar silver headlining, Pearl Nappa leather/Alcantara power-adjustable sport seats with optional leather upholstery in a choice of four colours, brushed aluminium inlays with optional Carbon Atlas, Piano finish or Aluminium/Beaufort wood trim panels. [ 32 ] The SQ5 TDI accelerates from 0–62 mph (100 km/h) in 5.1 secs, and is electronically limited to 155 mph. This is comparable to rival range-topping performance SUVs with diesel engines, such as the Porsche Cayenne S Diesel (0–60 mph (97 km/h): 5.7 s) and BMW X5 M50d (0–60 mph (97 km/h): 5.4 s), and also to high-performance petrol-powered SUVs, such as the Mercedes-Benz ML63 AMG (0–60 mph (97 km/h): 4.8 s), Porsche Cayenne Turbo S (0–60 mph (97 km/h): 4.1 s). [ 32 ] [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] These listed rivals are all larger and heavier, falling into the mid-size SUV class, and, as such, command significantly higher asking prices. A more realistic comparison may be made with the BMW X3 xDrive35d , which delivers slightly better economy (46.3 mpg to the SQ5's 41.5), though slightly lower performance (0–62 mph (100 km/h): 5.8 s, max speed: 149 mph (240 km/h)). [ 37 ] The SQ5 went on sale in the first quarter of 2013.

The vehicle was unveiled in the 2012 Paris Motor Show , and went on sale in the first quarter of 2013. [ 41 ] [ 42 ] In 2015 Audi introduced a 'plus' tdi model, with 340 PS (250 kW) and 700 N⋅m (516 lbf⋅ft), quilted nappa leather seats, external black details and 21-inch wheels as standard equipment. SQ5 3.0 TFSI quattro (2013–) [ edit ] Audi SQ5 TDI It is a petrol version of the SQ5 with 3.0 TFSI engine rated 354 PS (260 kW; 349 hp) at 6,000–6,500 rpm and 470 N⋅m (346.65 lbf⋅ft) at 4,000–4,500 rpm, eight-speed tiptronic transmission, quattro permanent all-wheel drive with torque vectoring, 20-inch wheels with 255/45-series tires (optional 21-inch wheels), platinum grey radiator grille with horizontal double bars in aluminium look, choice of 2 crystal-effect body colours (Estoril Blue, Panther Black), instruments feature grey dials and white numerals, pedals and shift paddles in shiny aluminium-look finish, black interior with headlining optionally available in Moon Silver, power-adjustable sport seats upholstered in Pearl Nappa leather and Alcantara (option four different colours of leather), standard brushed aluminium inlays (optional Carbon Atlas, Piano finish or layered aluminium and wood in Beaufort black).

[ 52 ] Long wheelbase version (Q5L), (2018–) [ edit ] A long wheelbase version was unveiled at the Beijing Auto Show , with 88 mm (3.5 in) added to the car, resulting in 23 percent more legroom. Q5L Q5L Q5L facelift Q5L Sportback Q5L Sportback Markets [ edit ] Asia [ edit ] The second generation of the Q5 will be the first generation of the Q5 to be sold in Bangladesh. [ 53 ] The Q5 was launched in Thailand in August 2017, where a sole S-line powered by a 2.0 TFSI engine (45 TFSI) and 2.0 TDI engine (40 TDI) with a Quattro all wheel drive system is available. The Q5 was launched in Malaysia in March 2019, where a sole Sport trim line powered by a 2.0 TFSI engine with a Quattro all wheel drive system is available. [ 54 ] In August 2021, the facelifted Q5 was launched in Malaysia, [ 55 ] with the sports-oriented S-Line trim package. It gets a 2.0 TFSI engine with mild-hybrid tech, Quattro AWD and the S Tronic dual-clutch transmission. Not long after, the Q5 Sportback also made its local debut in Malaysia. [ 56 ] North America [ edit ] The second generation Q5 was launched in North America in 2018. Production shifted from Germany to the new Audi México, S.A. de C.V. factory in San José Chiapa, Puebla, México . The Q5 was launched with a 2.0 TFSI petrol engine. Power output was 252 hp (188 kW; 255 PS) and 273 lb⋅ft (370 N⋅m). Audi's Quattro all-wheel drive system is standard, however it uses ‘Quattro with Ultra Technology’. According to Audi, Ultra technology improves efficiency by decoupling the driveshaft to the rear wheels when all-wheel drive is not needed. Essentially the vehicle becomes front wheel drive when cruising, or in other driving situations where the vehicle's computers determine all-wheel traction is not needed. Audi claims the system is able to re-engage power to the rear wheels within milliseconds of the system detecting or predicting slip or the driver accelerating aggressively. Unlike in the previous 8R generation Q5, US vehicles are only offered with the 2.0T TFSI I-4 engine. The 2.0T ‘45 TFSI’ model offers acceleration similar to the previous generation's 3.0 TFSI Supercharged V6 (face-lifted Q5 8R, 2013–2017) while using less fuel and reduced emissions. No TDI version will be offered in North America due to the fallout from the diesel emissions scandal. Bucking an industry-wide trend of moving away from dual clutch transmissions for the latest generation of conventional torque converter automatics, Audi actually replaced the previous generation's ZF 8HP 8-speed automatic transmission for their own 7-speed S-Tronic dual clutch gearbox. The SQ5 is offered as a performance variant of the Q5. In North American spec, it uses a 3.0L DOHC direct-injected Miller Cycle-capable 90° V6 with a single twin-scroll turbocharger. This engine, dubbed EA839, is a substantially reworked version of the previous-generation supercharged V6 (EA837) that was used in the first generation Q5 3.0T and SQ5. Power output for the turbocharged engines remains at 264 kW (354 hp), however torque increases to 500 N⋅m (369 lb⋅ft) at only 1370 rpm. Unlike the lesser powered Q5 ‘45 TFSI’ 2.0T, Audi retained ZF's 8HP transmission for the SQ5, and it also utilizes the full-time rear-biased quattro AWD system.  Utilizing the Torsen CSM self-locking center differential, default power distribution is 40% front/60% rear.  The center differential can instantaneously divert up to 70% of available engine power to the front wheels or up to 85% to the rear wheels.  This permanent version of the Quattro AWD system is also available with the torque-vectoring rear "sport differential". For the 2019 model year, heated front seats, rear electric child locks, 7-inch infotainment screen, and roof crossbars became standard equipment. For the Premium Plus trim, rear USB charge ports and wireless charging became standard while for Prestige trims, park assist was made standard. The Convenience Package was expanded to include the Audi side assist and Audi pre sense rear safety systems. In addition, Audi introduced a "black optic" package for the Q5, featuring black exterior trim and unique wheels. The SQ5 also became available in the Premium trim. [ 57 ] In 2020, Audi introduced the Q5 TFSI e plug-in hybrid variant. It featured a 14.1 kWh lithium-ion battery , giving an EPA estimated 20 miles (32 km) of range. A heat pump was implemented into the climate control system, providing for greater heating efficiency. The plug-in variant also received the Turbo Blue and Daytona Gray colors, available only on the plug-in variant and SQ5 models. It produced 362 hp (270 kW; 367 PS) and 369 lb⋅ft (500 N⋅m) of torque and had a 0–60 mph (0–97 km/h) time of 5.0 seconds, nearly a second faster than the standard Q5. [ 58 ] For the 2022 model year, the battery size was increased to 17.9 kWh, increasing the EPA range to 23 miles (37 km).

This includes a digital marketplace in the myAudi app to add Audi Connect plans and SiriusXM with 360L. [ 61 ] Exterior facelift revisions include updates to the grille, bumper side air intakes, side sill, and rear trim. In addition, District Green and Ultra Blue were new paint colors available on the PHEV and SQ5 variants. [ 62 ] The 2021 Q5 was announced at the end of June 2020 [ 63 ] and entered production in July [ 64 ] with expected first deliveries at the end of 2020. In January 2021, Audi expanded the Q5 lineup by introducing a Sportback variant of the Q5 and SQ5. [ 65 ] The Q5 was launched in India on 23 November 2021 offering two variants - Premium Plus and Technology.

[ 71 ] The coupé SUV model, marketed as the Sportback , was unveiled on 26 November 2024. [ 72 ] In North America, it was launched in April 2025 for the 2026 model year. The third-generation Audi Q5 represents the first complete redesign since 2018 and is built on Volkswagen Group's new Premium Platform Combustion (PPC) architecture shared with the redesigned Audi A5 [ 73 ] [ 74 ] . The exterior styling features a raked silhouette inspired by the larger Q7, with a specific visual ratio between the greenhouse and body creating a clear SUV shoulder with a clean beltline running from front to rear [ 74 ] . New lighting signatures can be customized to eight different patterns for both front and rear, with available IQ.Light LED matrix headlamps providing illumination range up to 500 meters. The redesign marks a departure from the previous generation by eliminating fake exhaust finishers in favor of functional exhaust tips, with dual rectangular outlets on the Q5 and quad tips on the SQ5 [ 74 ] . The base Q5 is powered by a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four engine producing 268 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque, representing a 7-horsepower increase over the previous 45 TFSI powertrain [ 73 ] [ 75 ] . All Q5 variants feature Audi's new 48-volt Mild Hybrid Plus system producing 18 kW and 230 N⋅m, capable of operating on pure electric power at low speeds [ 76 ] . Power is transmitted through a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission with standard all-wheel drive, achieving 0-60 mph acceleration in 5.8 seconds. The performance-oriented SQ5 features a 3.0-liter turbocharged V6 engine generating 362 horsepower and 406 lb-ft of torque, an increase from the previous model's 349 horsepower. Maximum towing capacity for both models is rated at 4,400 pounds, with cargo space of 1,473 liters for the Q5 and 1,388 liters for the SQ5 Sportback. The interior features an 11.9-inch digital instrument cluster and a 14.5-inch touchscreen for the infotainment system, with an optional 10.9-inch passenger display available on Prestige trim levels. All displays utilize bright panels with quick response times and deep black contrast, though the instrument cluster offers reduced customization compared to the previous generation. Climate controls have been relocated to a dedicated section at the bottom of the center touchscreen, though physical buttons remain absent despite criticism from reviewers. An available Bang & Olufsen audio system features 16 speakers with noise canceling technology, while Dynamic Interaction Light spans the width of the cabin displaying welcome, locking, and turn signal animations. The Q5 Prestige and all SQ5 trim levels come standard with air suspension featuring active adaptive dampers, an uncommon feature in the luxury compact SUV segment. Plug-in hybrid e-hybrid variants were revealed in June 2025, featuring the same 2.0-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine paired with an electric motor and a 25.9 kWh battery pack (20.7 kWh usable). Two power levels are offered: 295 horsepower and 362 horsepower, with the higher output matching the SQ5's power rating. The battery capacity represents a 45 percent increase over the previous generation, providing approximately 62 miles of electric range on the WLTP cycle, up from 38 miles. Base pricing for the 2026 Q5 starts at approximately $54,000, positioning it competitively against rivals such as the BMW X3 and Mercedes-Benz GLC.
