In 2002, it started producing the Chevrolet Niva , based on the Lada Niva , at its Tolyatti plant. Though both companies had an equal share of ownership, the venture was managed exclusively by General Motors. [ 2 ] The venture ended in December 2019, after it was wholly acquired by AvtoVAZ. History [ edit ] Chevrolet Niva In 2004 the joint venture briefly produced the Chevrolet Viva , based on the 1998 Opel Astra saloon, but after low sales of only 5,000 the model was dropped. [ 3 ] The joint venture reached difficulties and production stoppages for a fortnight in February 2006 when AvtoVAZ was taken over by Rosoboronexport , the Russian state-owned arms-export agency, and a disagreement between the new owners and GM lead to stoppages of the supply of engines and other components. [ 3 ] In September 2012, the joint venture announced plans to expand by 2015, hiring an additional 1,400 employees and increasing its annual production capacity from 100,000 to 120,000 vehicles. [ 4 ] Ownership [ edit ] Voice of America report, showing operations inside the plant and an interview with a representative from GM Russia. The joint venture was created with investment from General Motors ($99.1m, 41.61%), AvtoVAZ ($99.1m, 41.61%) and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development ($40m, 16,78%, plus a loan facility for $100 million). In September 2012 GM and Avtovaz purchased EBRD's share, turning the joint venture into a 50/50 relationship. [ 5 ] In December 2019, AvtoVAZ acquired General Motors' stake in the venture, ending it. [ 6 ] The Chevrolet branding would still be used by AvtoVAZ on the Niva models until August 2020, before replacing it by Lada . [ 7 ] Products [ edit ] As of December 2014, the joint venture produced 571,852 vehicles since production at Tolyatti commenced in 2002.
