It was the ninth race of the 2018–19 Formula E season and the third edition of the event. Report [ edit ] Background [ edit ] The Monaco ePrix was confirmed to be returning to the Formula E calendar on 4 November 2018. [ 1 ] It was the first time the race was held since 2017 as the event is held biennially, alternating with the Historic Grand Prix of Monaco . Originally, series founder and CEO Alejandro Agag had wanted to upgrade to using the full size Circuit de Monaco instead of the shorter version used in 2017 and 2015 centred around the Rainier III Nautical Stadium . [ 2 ] However, plans for this fell through when the FIA objected to it in September 2018. [ 3 ] Going into the weekend, Virgin Racing's Robin Frijns lead the championship with 81 points, a 1 point lead over Techeetah 's André Lotterer with BMW Andretti's António Félix da Costa down in 3rd with 70 points. In the team's standings, Techeetah lead with 142 points followed behind by Envision Virgin with 135 and defending constructors champions, Audi Sport Abt Schaeffler down in 3rd with 129. After the previous round in Paris, three drivers were left with three place grid penalties for qualifying for causing collisions. [ 4 ] They were Jerome D'Ambrosio who collided with Frijns's team mate Sam Bird , Edoardo Mortara who collided with Jaguar's Alex Lynn and Oliver Rowland who collided with Alexander Sims .
