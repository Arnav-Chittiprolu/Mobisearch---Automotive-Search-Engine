[ 4 ] Garmin was founded in 1989 by Gary Burrell and Min Kao in Lenexa, Kansas . [ 5 ] [ 6 ] [ 2 ] In 1996, the company established corporate headquarters in Olathe, Kansas. Since 2010, the company has been legally incorporated in Schaffhausen , Switzerland, with principal subsidiaries located in the United States, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom. [ 7 ] As of 2024, the company has nearly 22,000 employees in 34 countries and generated US$6.3 billion in revenue. [ 1 ] Garmin was initially associated with personal in-car navigation devices, but now offers several product lines across different markets, with an emphasis on smartwatch technology. In 2022, Garmin smartwatches represented the largest market share of the premium smartwatch market (watches greater than $500), leading to it having the fifth largest share of overall smartwatches sold and the third by revenue. [ 8 ] As of February 2023, Garmin has shipped more than 282 million products worldwide. [ 9 ] History Founding and initial growth: 1989 to 1999 In 1983, Gary Burrell recruited Min H. Kao from the defense contractor Magnavox while working for the former King Radio . [ 10 ] They founded Garmin in 1989 in Lenexa, Kansas , [ 2 ] as "ProNav". [ 10 ] ProNav's first product was a GPS unit for boaters called GPS 100. [ 10 ] It debuted at the 1990 International Marine Technology Exposition, where it garnered 5,000 orders. [ 11 ] A short time later, in 1991, the company opened a manufacturing facility in Taiwan. [ 12 ] The company was later renamed "Garmin", a portmanteau of its two founders, Gary Burrell and Min H. Kao. [ 13 ] In 1991, the U.S. Army became their first customer. [ 14 ] In 1994, Garmin released GPS 155, the first IFR -certified aviation navigation system. [ 7 ] By 1995, Garmin's sales had reached $102 million, and it had achieved a profit of $23 million. [ 15 ] In 1996, the company headquarters moved to Olathe, Kansas. [ 2 ] A year later, Garmin sold its one millionth unit. [ 16 ] In 1998, Garmin released the GNS 430 and StreetPilot. [ 17 ] GNS 430 was an integrated avionics system that served as both GPS navigation receiver and communications transceiver. [ 18 ] StreetPilot was Garmin’s first portable navigation system for cars.

[ 51 ] In 2023, Garmin announced a two-year study with the U.S. Space Force. [ 52 ] Under the study, over 6000 Garmin Forerunner 55 and Instinct 2 Solar watches were given to members of Space Force (known as Guardians). [ 52 ] The study aims to answer the question of whether or not regular active fitness testing can be replaced by fitness assessments made with data from the smartwatches. [ 52 ] In addition to their health and wellness features, the watches were chosen because they have the ability to disable GPS functionality, should there be a need for higher military privacy and security. [ 53 ] That same year, the company announced that Garmin fenix 7 watches would be used by crew members  during the Polaris Dawn space mission to monitor health stats and vitals. [ 54 ] In 2024, the Independent Boat Builders, Inc. (IBBI) selected Garmin as its exclusive marine electronics and audio supplier.

[ 79 ] July 2020 outage On July 23, 2020, Garmin shut down its call centres, website and some online services, including Garmin Connect and flyGarmin, after a ransomware attack encrypted its internal network and some production systems. The company did not say it was a ransomware attack, but company employees writing on social media described it as such, [ 80 ] with some speculation about a ransomware strain called WastedLocker [ 81 ] later confirmed. [ 82 ] Hackers reportedly demanded a $10 million ransom from Garmin. [ 83 ] The company instituted a "multi-day maintenance window" to deal with the attack's impacts. [ 81 ] Some Garmin online services began to function again on July 27, 2020, though delays in synchronising data with connected applications were expected; Strava anticipated a delay of "a week or longer". [ 84 ] Experts speculated that Garmin had paid hackers a reported $10m ransom, or brokered some other kind of deal. [ 85 ] [ 86 ] The outage meant Garmin could not receive calls or emails, or conduct online chats. [ 87 ] Athlete users of Garmin wearables could not upload mileage, location, heart rate, and other data. Pilots were unable to download data for Garmin aircraft navigational systems, preventing flight scheduling. [ 81 ] Garmin said there was "no indication" that personal information had been stolen.

GMA340 Audio control, GNS430 Nav/Com and GTX327 transponder in a light aircraft GWX 68 weather radar United Parcel Service AT (Aviation Technologies) In 2003, Garmin acquired UPS Aviation Technologies, including that firm's II Morrow Apollo line of aircraft MFD/GPS/NAV/COMM units. II Morrow had been founded in Salem, Oregon in 1982 as a manufacturer of LORAN C marine and general aviation products. In 1982 its aircraft navigator 602 LORAN C receiver permitted point to point navigation. Some examples of its LORAN units are Apollo II 616B Aviation LORAN panel mount (1986), II Morrow Apollo 604 Loran Navigator (1987) and Apollo 820 GPS Flybuddy (1991). In 1986, United Parcel Service (UPS) purchased the company to expand the use of electronic technology in the package delivery and tracking business. II Morrow shifted focus from marine business to development of package process automation technology for UPS such as vehicle management systems, automated high speed package sorting systems, as well as delivery and tracking systems. In 1999, II Morrow was renamed to UPS Aviation Technologies, and re-focused towards modernizing UPS' Boeing 7xx series Heavy Iron Transport Category Aircraft fleet, as well they also re-entered the general aviation marketplace. It certified the first Gamma 3 WAAS GPS engine for FAA Certified Precision GPS approaches. [ 169 ] The new certified WAAS engine yielded vertical and horizontal accuracy of one meter RMS in guidance into airports without existing ILS approaches. This GPS technology met the FAA's TSO-C146a primary navigation standards for en route, terminal and approach phases of flight—with WAAS augmentation as the sole means of navigation.  This primary GPS "sole source" navigation capability was integrated into the CNX-80.  The CNX-80 WAAS GPS/COM/NAV integrated navigator was the first product in the industry approved for primary GPS navigation. It also enabled LPV glideslope approaches without requiring ground nav aids. New LNAV (GPS) approaches provide the accuracy and safety of an ILS—without the ground-based localizer and glideslope equipment. [ 170 ] Later, the CNX-80 was renamed the GNS-480, under Garmin. [ 171 ] In 1999: Flight International magazine presented UPS Aviation Technologies with its Aerospace Industry Award for the development of ADS-B, a surveillance technology intended to reduce aviation delays while improving safety. [ 172 ] Garmin Aviation offers electronically integrated cockpits for aircraft: panel mount displays, primary flight displays (PFD) and multi-function displays (MFD), transponders, radar, and other types of avionic systems . Garmin entered this market in 1991 with the GPS-100AVD panel-mounted receiver. Its first portable unit, the GPS-95 , was introduced in 1993. In 1994, the GPS-155 panel-mounted unit was the first GPS receiver on the market to receive full FAA certification for instrument approaches . In 1998, Garmin introduced the GNS-430 , an integrated GPS navigation receiver/communications transceiver. That same year, the company rolled out its first integrated GPS, COM, VOR, LOC and glideslope product, the GNS 430. More than 125,000 GNS navigators are now installed in aircraft. Garmin reached its one millionth delivery in November 2017. [ 173 ] The G1000 is an all-glass avionics suite for OEM aircraft, the similar G950 is used in experimental aircraft , and the G600 is a retrofit . [ 174 ] On October 30, 2019, Garmin announced that the Piper M600 and Cirrus Vision Jet would become the first general aviation aircraft certified with the company's emergency autoland system, which is capable of automatically landing the aircraft with the push of a button and will be a part of both aircraft's G3000 integrated avionics suite in 2020.
