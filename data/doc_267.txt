Help From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This category has a backlog that requires the attention of willing editors. This notice will hide itself when this category has fewer than 100 items. ( recount ) This is a maintenance category , used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project . It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages , or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories (except for eponymous maintenance categories). This is a hidden category . It is not shown on its member pages, unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. This category contains all pages labeled with inline weasel word -related templates such as {{ WW }} , {{ Weasel-inline }} , {{ Who }} , or {{ Which }} . It exists primarily for bot-based monitoring of articles containing weasel words. By-month categories are located in Category:Articles with specifically marked weasel-worded phrases .
The key to improving weasel words in articles is to either: a) name a source for the opinion; or b) change any opinionated language to concrete facts. After making such changes, remove the template from the article. Fix one!
