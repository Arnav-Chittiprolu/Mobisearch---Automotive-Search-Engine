Modern aerodynamics only dates back to the seventeenth century, but aerodynamic forces have been harnessed by humans for thousands of years in sailboats and windmills,<ref>{{cite web |title=Wind Power's Beginnings (1000 BC – 1300 AD) Illustrated History of Wind Power Development |url=http://telosnet.com/wind/early.html |publisher=Telosnet.com |access-date=2011-08-24 |archive-date=2010-12-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202073417/http://telosnet.com/wind/early.html |url-status=usurped }}</ref> and images and stories of flight appear throughout recorded history,<ref>{{cite book |first=Don |last=Berliner |year=1997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Efr2Ll1OdqMC&pg=PA128 |title=Aviation: Reaching for the Sky |publisher= The Oliver Press, Inc. |page=128 |isbn= 1-881508-33-1}}</ref> such as the [[Ancient Greek]] legend of [[Icarus]] and [[Daedalus]].<ref>{{cite book |author1=Ovid |author2=Gregory, H. | title=The Metamorphoses | publisher=Signet Classics | year=2001 | isbn=0-451-52793-3 | oclc=45393471}}</ref> Fundamental concepts of [[Continuum mechanics|continuum]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], and [[pressure gradient]]s appear in the work of [[Aristotle]] and [[Archimedes]].<ref name = "andersonhist"/>

In 1726, Sir [[Isaac Newton]] became the first person to develop a theory of air resistance,<ref>{{cite book | author=Newton, I. | title=Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, Book II | year=1726}}</ref> making him one of the first aerodynamicists. [[Netherlands|Dutch]]-[[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[mathematician]] [[Daniel Bernoulli]] followed in 1738 with ''Hydrodynamica'' in which he described a fundamental relationship between pressure, density, and flow velocity for [[incompressible flow]] known today as [[Bernoulli's principle]], which provides one method for calculating aerodynamic lift.<ref>{{cite web | url =https://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/658890/Hydrodynamica#tab=active~checked%2Citems~checked&title=Hydrodynamica%20--%20Britannica%20Online%20Encyclopedia | title= Hydrodynamica | access-date=2008-10-30 |publisher= Britannica Online Encyclopedia }}</ref> In 1757, [[Leonhard Euler]] published the more general [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics)|Euler equations]] which could be applied to both compressible and incompressible flows.

In 1799, [[George Cayley|Sir George Cayley]] became the first person to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight ([[weight]], [[Lift (force)|lift]], [[Aerodynamic drag|drag]], and [[thrust]]), as well as the relationships between them,<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S Centennial of Flight Commission – Sir George Cayley. |url=http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Prehistory/Cayley/PH2.htm |access-date=2008-09-10 |quote=Sir George Cayley, born in 1773, is sometimes called the Father of Aviation. A pioneer in his field, he was the first to identify the four aerodynamic forces of flight – weight, lift, drag, and thrust and their relationship. He was also the first to build a successful human-carrying glider. Cayley described many of the concepts and elements of the modern airplane and was the first to understand and explain in engineering terms the concepts of lift and thrust. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920052758/http://centennialofflight.gov/essay/Prehistory/Cayley/PH2.htm |archive-date=20 September 2008 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref name="AerNav123">''Cayley, George''.

In 1871, [[Francis Herbert Wenham]] constructed the first [[wind tunnel]], allowing precise measurements of aerodynamic forces. Drag theories were developed by [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]],<ref>{{cite book | author=d'Alembert, J. | title=Essai d'une nouvelle theorie de la resistance des fluides | year=1752}}</ref> [[Gustav Kirchhoff]],<ref>{{cite journal | author=Kirchhoff, G. | title=Zur Theorie freier Flussigkeitsstrahlen | journal=Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik |volume=1869| issue=70 |pages=289–298 | year=1869| doi=10.1515/crll.1869.70.289 | s2cid=120541431 | url=https://zenodo.org/record/1448898 }}</ref> and [[John Strutt, 3rd Baron Rayleigh|Lord Rayleigh]].<ref>{{cite journal | author=Rayleigh, Lord | title=On the Resistance of Fluids | journal=Philosophical Magazine |volume=2| issue=13 |pages=430–441 |doi=10.1080/14786447608639132| year=1876| url=https://zenodo.org/record/1431123 }}</ref> In 1889, [[Charles Renard]], a French aeronautical engineer, became the first person to reasonably predict the power needed for sustained flight.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Renard, C. | title=Nouvelles experiences sur la resistance de l'air | journal=L'Aéronaute |volume=22|pages= 73–81 | year=1889}}</ref> [[Otto Lilienthal]], the first person to become highly successful with glider flights, was also the first to propose thin, curved [[airfoil]]s that would produce high lift and low drag. Building on these developments as well as research carried out in their own wind tunnel, the [[Wright brothers]] flew the first powered airplane on December 17, 1903.

During the time of the first flights, [[Frederick W. Lanchester]],<ref>{{cite book | author=Lanchester, F. W. | title=Aerodynamics | url=https://archive.org/details/aerodynamicscons00lanc | year=1907}}</ref> [[Martin Kutta]], and [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]] independently created theories that connected [[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]] of a fluid flow to lift. Kutta and Zhukovsky went on to develop a two-dimensional wing theory. Expanding upon the work of Lanchester, [[Ludwig Prandtl]] is credited with developing the mathematics<ref>{{cite book | author=Prandtl, L. | title=Tragflügeltheorie | publisher=Göttinger Nachrichten, mathematischphysikalische Klasse, 451–477 | year=1919}}</ref> behind thin-airfoil and lifting-line theories as well as work with [[boundary layer]]s.

As aircraft speed increased designers began to encounter challenges associated with air [[compressibility]] at speeds near the speed of sound. The differences in airflow under such conditions lead to problems in aircraft control, increased drag due to [[shock wave]]s, and the threat of structural failure due to [[Aeroelasticity|aeroelastic flutter]]. The ratio of the flow speed to the speed of sound was named the [[Mach number]] after [[Ernst Mach]] who was one of the first to investigate the properties of the [[supersonic]] flow. [[Macquorn Rankine]] and [[Pierre Henri Hugoniot]] independently developed the theory for flow properties before and after a [[shock wave]], while [[Jakob Ackeret]] led the initial work of calculating the lift and drag of supersonic airfoils.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Ackeret, J. | title=Luftkrafte auf Flugel, die mit der grosser also Schallgeschwindigkeit bewegt werden | journal=Zeitschrift für Flugtechnik und Motorluftschiffahrt |volume=16|pages=72–74 | year=1925}}</ref> [[Theodore von Kármán]] and [[Hugh Latimer Dryden]] introduced the term [[transonic]] to describe flow speeds between the [[critical Mach number]] and Mach 1 where drag increases rapidly. This rapid increase in drag led aerodynamicists and aviators to disagree on whether supersonic flight was achievable until the [[sound barrier]] was broken in 1947 using the [[Bell X-1]] aircraft.

By the time the sound barrier was broken, aerodynamicists' understanding of the subsonic and low supersonic flow had matured. The [[Cold War]] prompted the design of an ever-evolving line of high-performance aircraft. [[Computational fluid dynamics]] began as an effort to solve for flow properties around complex objects and has rapidly grown to the point where entire aircraft can be designed using computer software, with wind-tunnel tests followed by flight tests to confirm the computer predictions. Understanding of [[supersonic]] and [[hypersonic]] aerodynamics has matured since the 1960s, and the goals of aerodynamicists have shifted from the behaviour of fluid flow to the engineering of a vehicle such that it interacts predictably with the fluid flow. Designing aircraft for supersonic and hypersonic conditions, as well as the desire to improve the aerodynamic efficiency of current aircraft and propulsion systems, continues to motivate new research in aerodynamics, while work continues to be done on important problems in basic aerodynamic theory related to flow turbulence and the existence and uniqueness of analytical solutions to the Navier–Stokes equations.
