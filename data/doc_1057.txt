Volkswagen Pointer rear Interior It was based on the European version of the Ford Escort , being the result of Volkswagen Group 's AutoLatina joint venture with Ford Motor Company , which also saw the Volkswagen Santana rebadged as the Ford Versailles . Although there were sheet metal differences between the Pointer and the Escort, the styling cues were still noticeably those of Ford rather than Volkswagen. The nameplate remained in use after the Escort-based model was retired from production, as the Brazilian-manufactured Volkswagen Gol was marketed as the Volkswagen Pointer in Mexico, and also in Russia, Ukraine and Egypt. The Volkswagen Pointer five- door hatchback was developed on the same Ford Escort MkV platform as the Volkswagen Logus, presented in 1993 in October. Offered in four versions: CLI 1.8, GLI 1.8, GLI 2.0 and GTI 2.0. The last Pointer produced, a hatchback GTI model, was sent to Volkswagen 's factory museum in Wolfsburg , Germany .
