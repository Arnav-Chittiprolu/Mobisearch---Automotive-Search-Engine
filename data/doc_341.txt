From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Smallest sport utility vehicle class The Chevrolet Trax was the best-selling subcompact crossover SUV in the U.S. in 2024. [ 1 ] Subcompact crossover SUV is an automobile segment used to describe the smallest segment of crossover SUV , a type of sport utility vehicle , below the compact crossover SUV . Subcompact crossover SUVs are usually based on a platform of a subcompact (also known as supermini or B-segment ) passenger car, although some high-end subcompact crossover models are based on a compact car ( C-segment ). [ 2 ] The segment started to gain traction during early to mid-2010s when the number of models and sales figures rapidly increased in major markets such as North America and Europe. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] In 2019, around 22 percent of SUV global sales were contributed by subcompact crossovers. [ 5 ] The segment is particularly popular in Europe, India, and Brazil where they account for 37 percent, 75 percent, and 69 percent of total SUV sales in 2018 respectively. [ 6 ] In 2019, the best selling subcompact crossover was the Honda HR-V , recording 622,154 units being sold worldwide. [ 1 ] Terminology [ edit ] The "subcompact crossover SUV" or "subcompact crossover" term is most commonly used in North America, where the " subcompact " and "crossover" terms originated from. [ 4 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The segment is also known as " B-segment SUV", "B-SUV", [ 9 ] "small SUV", [ 10 ] [ 11 ] or "subcompact CUV". [ 12 ] It is also known with several other terms depending on the market, including "compact crossover" or "compact SUV", [ 13 ] which differs with the more common definition of a compact crossover SUV, which is a class larger and belongs to the C-segment . Classification of a certain model may also vary between markets due to differences in regional definitions, competition and pricing. Characteristics [ edit ] Subcompact crossovers commonly use the same platform of similarly-sized subcompact/B-segment hatchbacks or sedans , [ 14 ] [ 15 ] [ 16 ] while some high-end models may be based on a compact cars ( C-segment ). [ 17 ] Crossovers in this segment typically have limited off-road capabilities with the majority adopting front-wheel-drive layout, although many subcompact crossovers offer all-wheel-drive . [ 18 ] Depending on the market and the manufacturer, subcompact crossover SUVs typically have an exterior length under 4,400 mm (173.2 in). [ 19 ] [ 6 ] According to IHS Markit , vehicles from this segment were considered by customers as cheap to purchase and run, offer a "desirable lifestyle styling" and higher seating position. [ 3 ] Other advantages also include higher ground clearance, convenient ingress/egress, larger headroom, and larger legroom space compared to B-segment/subcompact hatchbacks. [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Despite built on the same platforms as subcompact cars and using much of the same technology, customers are shown to be willing to purchase them with a higher price. A study by JATO Dynamics showed that average price of subcompact SUVs sold in 2021 in the European market was €26,366 , compared with €20,699 for subcompact or small cars. [ 22 ] History [ edit ] Despite its exterior styling criticism , the Nissan Juke was argued to have started the wave of subcompact crossovers. The first-generation Honda HR-V was released in 1998 mainly for the Japanese and European markets, and has been considered as one of the first subcompact crossover. [ 23 ] Its exterior length stood between 4,000–4,110 mm (157.5–161.8 in), sold with either 3-doors and 5-doors, and was offered with an all-wheel-drive option. However, the release of the Nissan Juke in 2010 which was oriented towards Europe and North America was argued to have helped define and start the development of the almost non-existent segment at the time. [ 3 ] As the result of the increasing popularity of the segment, from mid-2010s, manufacturers began to phase out subcompact hatchbacks and sedans in favor of this segment in several markets since it offers higher profit margins, particularly in North America. [ 24 ] Due to its expanding market share, it is common in this segment for one brand to offer more than one model at different price points and segmentation. For example, as of 2022 [update] , Volkswagen offered three models in the segment in Europe, which are T-Roc , T-Cross , and Taigo . [ 22 ] Criticism [ edit ] According to 2020 tests conducted in the UK by Which? , vehicles from this class returned an average of around 7 percent worse fuel economy and 7 percent higher CO 2 tailpipe emissions than equivalent hatchbacks such as the Ford Fiesta and Renault Clio , and was said to be marginally less efficient than the medium hatchback class such as the Volkswagen Golf . [ 25 ] Markets [ edit ] United States [ edit ] In the North American market where larger vehicles are preferred, the segment has been largely marketed to urban drivers and consumers looking to downsize to a smaller, more efficient vehicle. [ 21 ] While not as popular as the larger compact crossovers , the segment has experienced major growth in the U.S. market in its brief history. [ 4 ] The Nissan Juke , which was unveiled at the 2010 New York International Auto Show to be sold for the 2011 model year was considered the first model in the segment, apart from the luxury Mini Countryman . [ 26 ] Many other nameplates in the segment appeared between 2013 and 2015, which included the Buick Encore , Chevrolet Trax , Fiat 500X , Ford EcoSport , Honda HR-V , Jeep Renegade , and Subaru Crosstrek . [ 27 ] [ 28 ] In 2015, there were 10 subcompact crossover nameplates in the U.S., totalling 411,774 units sold or 2.4 percent of the overall market. In that year, subcompact crossovers outsold subcompact cars for the first time in history. [ 29 ] In the following year, the Jeep Renegade was the first in the segment to cross the 100,000-sales threshold. [ 4 ] In 2018, the segment consisted of 16 nameplates and recorded 784,073 sales, capturing 12 percent of the U.S. crossover market and 4.5 percent of overall U.S. automobile market, according to the Automotive News Data Center. In comparison, the share of subcompact cars fell to 2.4 percent of the U.S. market in 2018 from 5.4 percent in 2010, while compact cars declined to 9.9 percent from 12.4 percent in the same period. [ 4 ] In 2019, the Hyundai Kona became the first subcompact crossover SUV to win the North American Utility Vehicle of the Year . [ 30 ] Around 50 percent of subcompact crossover SUVs sold in the U.S. in 2021 were produced in South Korea. [ 31 ] Top best-sellers in the U.S., 2023 Subaru Crosstrek (159,153 sold) Honda HR-V (122,206 sold) Europe [ edit ] European figures for B-segment SUV (including off-roaders ) had rapidly increased during the 2010s. Between 2000 and 2009, sales volume only doubled 60,000 units in 2000 to 125,000 units according to JATO Dynamics. However, IHS Markit noted that sales of the segment in Europe between 2010 and 2016 increased nearly tenfold from 134,000 units to 1.13 million units. [ 3 ] Industry analyst LMC Automotive predicts sales will reach 2.3 million in 2023 and will steadily rise to reach almost 3 million by 2028. [ 22 ] In 2010, Nissan introduced the Juke which was produced in the UK and Japan. [ 32 ] Many other nameplates entered the market between 2012 and 2013, which included the Dacia Duster , Chevrolet Trax , Ford EcoSport , Opel Mokka , Peugeot 2008 , Suzuki SX4 S-Cross , and Renault Captur . [ 33 ] [ 34 ] [ 35 ] Volkswagen entered the segment in 2017 with the release of the Volkswagen T-Roc, positioned below the Tiguan . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Other models such as the Citroën C3 Aircross , SEAT Arona and Hyundai Kona further boosted growth in 2017. In that year, B-SUV accounted for 10 percent of the overall automobile market. [ 38 ] Several manufacturers have changed their product mix by introducing subcompact crossovers to replace mini MPVs in Europe due to the popularity of the former and the declining sales of the latter. Models from the segment was seen a fit replacement for mini MPVs. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] The examples are the Citroën C3 Aircross which replaced the Citroën C3 Picasso and Opel Crossland X replacing the Opel Meriva . [ 3 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] According to data from JATO Dynamics, sales in 2021 totalled 2,018,791 units, representing 37 percent of the SUV market and 17 percent of the overall automobile market. [ 43 ] Petrol-powered vehicles dominated the segment with 72 percent of sales in the first 10 months of 2021, followed by diesel at 14 percent. Full-electric models accounted for 5.1 percent of sales in the same period. [ 22 ] According to JATO's data for Europe, seven European car brands that focused their efforts on developing SUVs, have seen their overall sales in the B and C segments fall dramatically between 2001 and 2021. [ 44 ] According to data from JATO Dynamics, sales in 2024 totalled 2,460,000 units, representing 36 percent of the SUV market and 19,1 percent of the overall automobile market.

[ 51 ] The distinction was due to the Indian vehicle dimensions regulations which imposes heavier tax for vehicles longer than 4 m (157.5 in). [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Renault entered the segment in 2012 when company saw a gap in the SUV market in India, which was filled by the Duster . The vehicle has proven to be a sales success in its initial release as its major competitors was from a segment above and a segment below. [ 54 ] [ 55 ] [ 56 ] Major growth of the B-SUV class continued in between 2015 and 2016, when the Hyundai Creta (introduced in 2015) and Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza (2016) was introduced to the market. Sales of B-SUVs increased 509 percent in January–May 2016 compared to the same period in 2015, while it gained 7.2 percent of overall market share. [ 57 ] The first mainstream sub-4 metre SUV to be launched in India was the Ford EcoSport (in 2012) which was a high-selling model due to the lack of competition, [ 58 ] followed by the Maruti Suzuki Vitara Brezza. Soon after, many other manufacturers followed suit, with 10 models available in the sub-segment as of 2021 [update] .
