https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_discontinued_Volkswagen_Group_petrol_engines

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The spark-ignition petrol (gasoline) engines listed below were formerly used in various marques of automobiles and commercial vehicles of the German automotive business Volkswagen Group [ 1 ] and also in Volkswagen Industrial Motor applications, but are now discontinued. All listed engines operate on the four-stroke cycle , and, unless stated otherwise, use a wet sump lubrication system and are water-cooled. [ 1 ] Since the Volkswagen Group is European, official internal combustion engine performance ratings are published using the International System of Units (commonly abbreviated SI ), a modern form of the metric system of figures. Motor vehicle engines will have been tested by a testing facility accredited by the Deutsches Institut für Normung (DIN), to either the original 80/1269/ EEC , or the later 1999/99/ EC standards. [ citation needed ] The standard unit of measure for expressing the rated motive power output is the kilowatt (kW); [ citation needed ] and in their official literature, the power rating may be published in either kilowatts or metric horsepower (abbreviated PS in Wikipedia, from the German Pferdestärke ), or both, and may also include conversions to imperial units such as the horsepower (HP) or brake horsepower (BHP). ( Conversions : one PS ≈ 735.5 watts (W), ≈ 0.98632 hp (SAE)). In case of conflict, the metric power figure of kilowatts (kW) will be stated as the primary figure of reference. For the turning force generated by the engine, the newton metre (N⋅m) will be the reference figure of torque. Furthermore, in accordance with European automotive traditions, engines shall be listed in the following ascending order of preference: [ citation needed ] Number of cylinders, engine displacement (in litres), engine configuration, and Rated motive power output (in kilowatts ). The petrol engines which Volkswagen Group is currently manufacturing and installing in today's vehicles can be found in the list of Volkswagen Group petrol engines article. This transport-related list is incomplete ; you can help by adding missing items . ( October 2021 ) Air-cooled [ edit ] Main article: Volkswagen air-cooled engine The Volkswagen air-cooled engine was introduced in 1935 in Germany, produced in factories all over the world, and the last complete engine was produced in December 2005, Its production was ceased by anti-pollution laws and the last engine was produced in São Bernardo do Campo . Its air-cooled , four-cylinder, boxer configuration was unusual in its day for a production automobile , but has gone on to power millions of vehicles around the world, being considered [ by whom? ] one of the most reliable automotive engines of all eras. Water-cooled boxer [ edit ] Main article: Volkswagen Wasserboxer engine The Volkswagen Wasserboxer is a horizontally opposed , or boxer , water-cooled four-cylinder petrol engine. It was introduced in 1982, and was produced for ten years, ending in 1992. The wasserboxer was only used in the Volkswagen Type 2 (T3) (T3 Transporter / Caravelle / Vanagon / Kombi / T25).

For current engines, see List of Volkswagen Group petrol engines § Four-cylinder EA827/EA113 , and List of Volkswagen Group petrol engines § Four-cylinder EA888 . The EA111 series of internal combustion engines was initially developed by Audi under Ludwig Kraus’s leadership and introduced in the mid-1970s in the Audi 50 , and shortly after in the original Volkswagen Polo . It is a series of water-cooled inline three - and inline four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines, in a variety of displacement sizes . This overhead camshaft engine features a crossflow cylinder head design, and directly driven auxiliary units.

All Volkswagen Group V8 and W8 petrol engines are constructed from a lightweight, cast aluminium alloy cylinder block (crankcase) and cylinder heads. They all use multi-valve technology, with the valves being operated by two overhead camshafts per cylinder bank (sometimes referred to as quad cam ). All functions of engine control are carried out by varying types of Robert Bosch GmbH Motronic electronic engine control units.

AUDI AG . 5.2 V10 40v FSI (C6 S6/D3 S8) [ edit ] A first in Audi 's history, this new generation high-performance V10 engine is based on Audi's V8 FSI engines , and retains the same fundamental design principals of the V8 FSI, including the crankcase, cylinder heads, valvetrain, fuel system and intake manifold. However, an all new crankshaft, balance shaft , double-chambered intake manifold with dual throttle valves, exhaust manifold, and ECU — are all unique to the V10. As part of the new V10 engine development, specific emphasis was placed on 'refinement', 'comfort' and 'sportiness' – as required for installation in Audi high-performance luxury cars. As well as gaining two additional cylinders compared to the V8, it has been bored by an extra two millimetres, and also shares the 90 degree (°) cylinder bank angle of the recent Audi V engines . Audi continue to use the Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI) technology, originally developed in the Audi R8 LMP endurance race cars. This engine is often, but incorrectly, referred to as a derivative of the Gallardo's original 5.0-litre Lamborghini V10 , which was also developed under the Volkswagen Group ownership. However, the subsequent 5.2 V10 FSI installed in the Gallardo LP560 and Audi R8 V10 is fundamentally identical to this Audi unit, save for a stronger crankshaft with solid main pin design, forged pistons, dry sump oiling system, different intake and exhaust valves, and engine management systems.
