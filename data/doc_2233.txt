Ltd. is the South African subsidiary of German automotive manufacturing company Volkswagen Group . Based in Kariega , in the Eastern Cape , the company was founded in 1946. History [ edit ] As early as the 1930s, the manufacturer Studebaker had explored the possibilities of an assembly plant in South Africa. [ 2 ] In 1947, an assembly plant was built in Uitenhage near Port Elizabeth . At around the same time, Klaus von Oertzen , a former executive member of Auto Union , tried to get DKW models assembled in South Africa. Despite his considerable commitment, this attempt was just as unsuccessful as his first attempt to export Volkswagen models to South Africa. [ 3 ] After renewed efforts and lengthy negotiations, production of the Beetle began on 31 August 1951 at South Africa Motor Assemblers and Distributors (SAMAD) in Uitenhage. [ 4 ] Volkswagen acquired a blocking minority in SAMAD in 1956. At the same time von Oertzen became the chairman of the board of SAMAD; he was nominally supposed to be followed by Heinrich Nordhoff in 1963. In 1966, SAMAD was renamed Volkswagen of South Africa Limited at an extraordinary general meeting. [ 2 ] In 1966, SAMAD, in which Volkswagenwerk AG held 63% of the shares at the time, had around 2,460 employees and sold 21,888 vehicles. [ 5 ] With 36,315 vehicles, Volkswagen became the best-selling brand in South Africa for the first time in 1973. In 1974, the plant became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Volkswagen Group . [ 2 ] In 2011, the plant in Uitenhage was the only non- European plant, besides the subsidiary in Mexico , that exported vehicles. [ 4 ] From 2008 to 2013, Volkswagen was the market leader in the South African passenger car market. [ 2 ] In 2015, Volkswagen of South Africa had 5600 employees. [ 6 ] In November 2024, Volkswagen announced its GenFarm project in Rwanda , an initiative to empower the agriculture landscape with electric-powered mobility especially for farming activities. Through this project, farmers can book electric-powered tractors that included trained drivers for their agricultural needs.
