All-wheel drive models have a {{Convert|3500|lb|kg|abbr=unit}} towing capacity, while rear wheel drive models have no tow rating.<ref>{{Cite web |title=2024 Cadillac LYRIQ |url=https://media.cadillac.com/media/us/en/cadillac/vehicles/lyriq/2024.tab1.html |access-date=2024-03-15 |website=media.cadillac.com}}</ref>

=== Lyriq-V ===
The Lyriq-V increases the power of the dual-motor, all-wheel drive Lyriq, with a peak output of {{convert|615|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|650|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque.<ref name="Lyriq-V_CD" /> This output can only be achieved in a driver-selected "Velocity Max" mode, which Cadillac claims can accelerate the Lyriq to 60&nbsp;mph in 3.3 seconds. The Lyriq-V adds a "V-Mode" control to customize performance settings and sound output. It uses the same 102{{Nbsp}}kWh battery as the dual-motor Lyriq, with a slightly decreased range of {{convert|285|mi|km}} estimated. The suspension is lowered with standard continuous damping control, and the steering ratio is changed for a quicker response.
