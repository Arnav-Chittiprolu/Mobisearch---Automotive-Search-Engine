Modifying BMS's [ edit ] a section on modifying bms's for vehicles can be added. Modifying a bms is needed if the owner of the vehicle wishes to install and extra battery and use the extra battery capacity, or perform other green tuning-tasks See http://www.elektor.com/magazines/2008/january/e-blocks-more-than-100-mpg-from-a-toyota-prius.321726.lynkx also see hymotion's battery management system/conversion at http://www.a123systems.com/hymotion/get_charged They also converted google's fleet (rechargeIT project) —Preceding unsigned comment added by 81.246.147.210 ( talk ) 15:31, 8 April 2009 (UTC) [ reply ] I don't agree that "Modifying a BMS" is part of the the definition of a BMS and suitable for Wikipedia. Perhaps in a general way such as to state that a BMS is specific to a cell configuration, thus would have to be modified or replaced to change the configuration.  While it may be of interest, I think it would be the same as putting a section on how to lower a car's springs or add a nitrous system to an article on cars. 185.8.252.37 ( talk ) 15:32, 26 June 2013 (UTC) [ reply ] Similar articles [ edit ] We have: Battery management system Smart Battery Data (which Battery monitoring redirects to) Smart Battery System Battery balancer Battery balancing Battery redistribution Most of those should probably be merged, especially the last three.
