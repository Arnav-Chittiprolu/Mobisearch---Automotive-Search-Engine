It is named after the city of Santa Fe, New Mexico , and was introduced for the 2001 model year as Hyundai's first SUV. The Santa Fe was a milestone in the company's restructuring program of the late 1990s because the SUV was a hit with American buyers. The Santa Fe was initially marketed as a compact crossover SUV in its first-generation. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] After the Tucson was introduced in 2004, marketed under that same class, the Santa Fe was later repositioned into the mid-size crossover SUV class since its second-generation launched in 2005. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] Through all generations, the Santa Fe has been offered in either front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive . The third-generation Santa Fe introduced in 2012 was available in two versions, which are regular (short) and extended long-wheelbase version. The short model was sold as the Santa Fe Sport in North America (three-row seating was not available) and simply Santa Fe in global markets (three-row seating was standard or optional), while the extended long-wheelbase model is called the Santa Fe in the U.S., Santa Fe XL in Canada and called the Hyundai Maxcruz in South Korea. The fourth-generation model, which was launched in 2018, introduced hybrid and plug-in hybrid powertrain (since 2020), and the fifth-generation model, which was launched in 2023, discontinued diesel engines .

In North America, a fuel-efficient 2.4 L four-cylinder engine was standard equipment and could be mated with either a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic. A 2,656 cc (2.7 L; 160 cu in) Delta V6 offered more power than the four-cylinder but was only available with the automatic . Front-wheel drive was standard (with traction control optional with the V6 ) and 4WD was optional. A 2.0 L Common Rail Turbo Diesel (CRTD) was offered outside the United States.  Australian Santa Fes went on sale in November 2000 with only one engine/transmission choice – a 2.7L V6 mated to a four-speed automatic transmission . 4WD was standard. A cheaper 2.4L four-cylinder joined the range several months later in 2001, but was only available with a manual transmission. 2002 [ edit ] The Santa Fe entered its second year with only one minor change involving the placement of the V6 emblem to a higher location on the tailgate. In February 2002, the centre dash vents and buttons were restyled. The clock was relocated to the centre dash from its prior location in the overhead map light assembly, which was also restyled. In April 2002, seat-mounted combination head and torso airbags were made standard for front occupants. [ 9 ] Demand for the Santa Fe continued to be up but owners had several suggested changes for Hyundai. Mid-2002 In a rare mid-year model change, Hyundai increased fuel tank capacity from 64 to 71 L (14.1 to 15.6 imp gal ; 16.9 to 18.8 US gal ) and a sunroof option was added in May 2002. At the same time, chrome interior door handles replaced matte gray handles and a chrome shifter gate on automatic equipped models replaced matte silver gate trim. Few models also received a factory alarm confirmation chirp feature when locked twice via remote, but was rarely equipped until the 2003 model began production. 2003 [ edit ] In 2003, Hyundai responded to some of the customer complaints and suggestions such as the fact that the bonnet used a prop and not gas struts, there was no light in the glove compartment, and the car itself did not have enough power.  In 2003, Hyundai introduced the 3.5-litre V6 in addition to the other two petrol engines in North America. The bigger engine came with a computer-controlled four-wheel drive system and a 5-speed automatic, based on the standard 4-speed. A Monsoon high-performance sound system came standard on the mid-level GLS model and came with a 6-disc CD changer on the top-tier LX. Rounding out the changes in the 2003 model was the discontinuation of the highly unpopular Pine Green which in some owner circles has gained the nickname 'Yucky Green'. [ citation needed ] In Australia, the four-cylinder Santa Fe was dropped in 2003, due to slow sales, leaving the 2.7L V6 automatic as the only model. 2004 [ edit ] Hyundai continued to post sales records with the Santa Fe as it rolled into 2004 with very minor changes. The manual climate controls on the base GL and mid-line GLS were revised very slightly. The remote keyless entry confirmation 'chirp' when the 'LOCK' button on the remote was pressed twice became standard. Mid-2004 Midway through the year the AM / FM antenna was moved from on the glass in the rear driver's side window to a three-inch (76 mm) rubber antenna in the centre of the roof just above the tailgate. 2005 [ edit ] 2005–2006 Hyundai Santa Fe (US) The Santa Fe received its final facelift for 2005. Changes were made to the grille, tail lights, rear bumper, interior instrument cluster.  The instrument cluster was redesigned with the speedometer reading 140 mph (225 km/h) (earlier models only indicated 130 mph) and a better-designed toll ticket slot in the driver's sun visor. Both sun visors also received extensions so the sun could be blocked out better when coming in from the side.  The base Santa Fe was discontinued that time, making way for the Tucson. In Australia, all models received body-coloured (painted) bumpers from 2005 on. The colour 'Sandstone' was discontinued in favour of a slightly different colour named 'Mocha Frost'. The GL trim was dropped as was the four-cylinder engine and its respective 5-speed manual transmission. The 2.7 L V6 took over duties as the base engine. A passenger airbag cutoff that prevents the airbag from deploying if the seat is unoccupied (or occupied by a small person) was also added. A 3-point seatbelt was added to the centre rear seating position, as well. The calendar function, housed in the overhead console was removed and a compass took its place. 2006 [ edit ] The last year of this Santa Fe saw few changes. Two colours were discontinued for 2006, Merlot and Canyon Red. A rare colour, Dark Emerald Green, was introduced mid-year. It did not appear in any sales brochures and could have only been ordered by a dealership. The LX trim level was renamed 'Limited' and got a corresponding tailgate badge, a first for the Santa Fe of any trim level. Another first was the availability of a monochromatic paint scheme, a departure from the contrasting gray cladding previously standard. The monochromatic option was only available on the Limited in black. In Europe , the new Santa Fe model was launched in April as a 2006 model, offering a new 2.2-litre diesel-powered engine and updated 2.7-litre petrol-powered V6 . Hawtai [ edit ] Main article: Hawtai Shengdafei Hawtai Shengdafei (China) Part of a joint venture with Hyundai Motors that began in 2002, a Chinese company, Hawtai Motor , manufactured the first-generation Santa Fe, marketed as the Shengdafei. [ 10 ] While it did make Hyundai-branded models for sale on the Chinese market, [ 10 ] one of the versions it debuted under its own brand name in 2009 was the Santa Fe C9. [ citation needed ] Utilizing a 1.8-litre turbocharged inline-four engine acquired from Rover , it was intended to be priced at a significant discount to those bearing the Hyundai name. [ 11 ] Hyundai ended its partnership with Hawtai in 2010 and production ended in 2015.

[ 17 ] In the United States, it debuted at the 2006 North American International Auto Show in Detroit . The first production Santa Fe in the United States rolled off Hyundai's Montgomery, Alabama assembly line on 18 April 2006. It shared this assembly line with the Hyundai Sonata . This new generation shed the old style's quirky design in favour of a more contemporary look. 2009 Hyundai Santa Fe SLX CRDi (Australia) In the United States, the new generation was offered in GLS, SE, and Limited versions. [ 18 ] The new Santa Fe saw the return of a manual transmission , but only when mated with the 2,656 cc (2.656 L; 162.1 cu in) V6 . The 3,342 cc (3.342 L; 203.9 cu in) [ 19 ] V6 (a retuned version of the same engine found in the Sonata) was standard on the SE and Limited and comes only with a 5-speed automatic. Both 2WD and AWD models with a 3.3 L have a fuel economy of 19 mpg ‑US (12 L/100 km; 23 mpg ‑imp ) city and 24 mpg ‑US (9.8 L/100 km; 29 mpg ‑imp ) highway. [ 19 ] The 2.2 L diesel engine (not available in the US) with 155 hp (116 kW) has mixed cycle of 7.2l and a city cycle of 8.0l. The 4WD is a Borg-Warner Torque Management device, which diverts power to the wheels with best grip according to the amount of slip. If the front wheels spin slightly, 10% of the torque will transfer to the rear axle. If the front wheels start to slip a lot, 50% of the torque will transfer to the rear axle. Body lean in turns, a problem with the previous generation, has been reduced in the new Santa Fe. Both road and wind noise have also been reduced. [ according to whom? ] Newly standard on the latest iteration of the Santa Fe are safety features the previous model lacked or charged as extra. Electronic stability control (ESC), side-curtain airbags for all seating rows, a tire pressure monitor, active front head restraints, and anti-lock brakes are all standard. [ 18 ] A heated windshield wiper grid located in the front wipers' 'park' position helps to thaw ice buildup on the blades in colder climates. Some features like the tailgate flip glass and the lower body cladding were not integrated into the new model. The interior has been upgraded with blue-lit dashboard controls (unlike the green colour used in other Hyundai models), a gated shifter pattern, illuminated cup holders, and higher quality leather on Limited models. The rear seat head restraints caused visibility problems in the previous model due to their size. The new style features 'shingled' head rests that when lowered completely, sit flush with the top of the seat, helping to maximize rear visibility. The middle rear seating position comes with its own head restraint and a three-point seat belt built in. LATCH child seat anchors are also standard, and an optional 50/50 third row seat allows Santa Fe to seat seven passengers. Pricing remained competitive despite the upward move in size and feature content. [ citation needed ] In Malaysia , Hyundai Santa Fe is available as a complete knock down model rebadged as Inokom Santa Fe. The Inokom Santa Fe is only available in CRDi 2.2- litre I4 Diesel and 2.7- litre V6 . The second-generation Hyundai Santa Fe was awarded 2008 Consumer Reports "top pick" and was among the top 10 vehicles for 2008 unveiled in the magazine's issue. The magazine's annual ratings, based on road tests and predicted safety and reliability, are considered highly influential among consumers. [ 20 ] 2008 [ edit ] For 2008, only minor changes were applied to the Santa Fe. A navigation system made by LG was offered and the Infinity sound system and the power glass sunroof were made standard on Limited models. [ 21 ] The non-metallic white paint trim was dropped, leaving the pearl white as the only white colour available on the Santa Fe. 2009 [ edit ] Interior 2009 saw only minor changes for the Santa Fe. New mirror indicators were introduced, except on US-built models. The 16" wheels on the base GLS model (USA specification) were dropped and replaced with black steel wheels and plastic covers. Additionally, the GLS received black plastic mirrors as opposed to the body-coloured mirrors of the higher-tier SE and Limited models. This cut in equipment was rumored to be a countermeasure to offset the price increase of offering an iPod plug-in for the stereo system. Because of the black mirrors and wheel covers, the additional cost of the iPod adapter was negated, leaving the base price of the vehicle unchanged. The Santa Fe topped the "20 least expensive 2009 vehicles to insure" list by Insure.com. According to research, the Santa Fe is the least expensive vehicle to insure. Low rates tend to reflect a vehicle's safety. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] December 2009 saw the introduction of a more economical 'R' series piezo electric injector-equipped 2.2-litre turbo-diesel four-cylinder producing 145 kW (194 hp) (up 27 per cent) at 3800 rpm and 436 N⋅m (322 lb⋅ft) of torque at 1800 rpm (421 N⋅m (311 lb⋅ft) for the manual). 2010 [ edit ] 2010 Hyundai Santa Fe Limited (US) Hyundai Santa Fe (Germany; facelift) A mid-cycle refresh designed in Germany for the Santa Fe was implemented for the 2010 model year. The grille includes horizontal and vertical gridded bars as opposed to the horizontal two-bar grille on previous models, and grilles are became body-coloured instead of black. New rear tail lights include all-red tail light covers with extensive chrome outlay, and new 5 split-spoke alloy wheels have replaced the previous 5- and 6-spoke wheels. All Santa Fes include standard Bluetooth hands-free phone connectivity and steering wheel audio controls, new darker wood trim, and metallic steering wheel inlay. Gauges have been designed with a new lettering and numbering typeface and backlight design. A new touch-screen navigation system with rear back-up camera was became available. For the US market, the optional third row seat has been discontinued, leaving the larger Veracruz the only then sold Hyundai in the United States to seat more than five people. [ 24 ] Powertrain changes included a choice of the standard six-speed manual transmission or the optional six-speed automatic transmission. Engine choices include a 2.4-litre four-cylinder and a 3.5-litre V6 engine. The latter engine is also used in the Kia Sorento . Both engines generate greater power while obtaining greater fuel economy than previous engine models. Sales began in early January 2010. 2011 [ edit ] Only minor changes were applied to the Santa Fe for 2011. The 1050-watt Infinity sound system became standard on Limited trim whereas it had only been previously bundled with the optional navigation system. Five new colours were added, as well, including Moonstone Silver, Frost White Pearl, Sonoran Red, Mineral Gray, and Espresso Brown. On 1 September 2010, North American production of the Santa Fe shifted to Kia's new West Point, Georgia assembly plant for the 2011 model year. This was done to free up production capacity at the Alabama plant for the new Sonata and new Elantra .  The Santa Fe fills the void left for a Kia-built Hyundai sold in the United States & Canada after Hyundai ended production of the Entourage minivan in 2009.  Kia, however, is 49.2% owned by Hyundai. 2012 [ edit ] The Santa Fe only received minor changes for 2012: The all-body coloured grille (in North American markets) was straightened and received chrome accents while the textured strip below the headlights was changed from amber to clear. The interior received a new shift knob and downhill brake assist was added. The 2012 model was discontinued by the end of the year, therefore ending production of the second generation Santa Fe. Santa Fe Blue Hybrid [ edit ] There is a Hyundai Santa Fe Blue Hybrid that is powered by petrol engine coupled to a 30 kW (41 PS; 40 hp) electric motor. The Santa Fe blue Hybrid uses a 270 V lithium polymer battery. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] Recall [ edit ] Hyundai has recalled almost 200,000 Santa Fe SUVs from the 2007 to 2009 model years, because the front passenger airbags may not deploy in a crash due to a possible problem with the occupant classification system. The system gauges the size of a passenger and bases on that whether an airbag should be deployed. A software update rectifies the issue. [ 27 ] Safety [ edit ] The second-generation Santa Fe earned "Top Safety Pick" award by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety . [ 23 ] It also received maximum 5 star safety ratings by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). [ 28 ] [ 29 ] The Hyundai Santa Fe earned maximum five star safety rating from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP). [ 30 ] The second-generation Hyundai Santa Fe topped the "20 least expensive 2009 vehicles to insure" list by Insure.com.

He also picked up a hitchhiking toddler girl and both were wearing seatbelts instead of approved child restraints which also breached safety recommendations. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] The ad was produced by Kim Thorp and Howard Greive from Assignment Group NZ and directed by Tony Williams from Sydney Film Company, with post via Frame Set + Match, Sydney.

Unveiled at the 2012 New York International Auto Show on 4 April, [ 43 ] the third generation Santa Fe features two wheelbase variants: shorter 5-seat Sport variant (7-seat is optional in several markets) and the long-wheelbase version (called Santa Fe XL in Canada) with three rows of seats and available seating for six or seven passengers. Both models feature the new "Storm Edge" design prototype, eventually launch on all other models, and feature refreshed Santa Fe unibody crossover platform. Short-wheelbase version (DM) [ edit ] The short-wheelbase version is marketed as the Santa Fe Sport in the United States and Canada, and simply Santa Fe in other regions. While the Santa Fe Sport is solely available in two-row in North America, a third-row seat option is available as standard or optional in most regions outside North America. The 2013 Santa Fe Sport models arrived with an all four-cylinder engine lineup. The standard engine is a 2.4 L developing 190 horsepower (142 kW), with a 264 hp (268 PS; 197 kW) 2.0 L turbo four on offer. Front-wheel drive is standard, with all-wheel drive being optional. The Santa Fe Sport has Hyundai's Torque Vectoring Cornering Control feature for upgraded drive performance. Both engines shift through a six-speed automatic transmission (already found in the Azera sedan), returning up to 33 mpg ‑US (7.1 L/100 km; 40 mpg ‑imp ) for the naturally aspirated model and 31 mpg ‑US (7.6 L/100 km; 37 mpg ‑imp ) for the Santa Fe Sport 2.0T model. The Korean-spec Santa Fe was launched in Asia since 19 April 2012, in short wheel base form with 7-seater capacity. Available engine types are a 2.0L E-VGT R-Line and 2.2L E-VGT R-Line diesel engines. [ 44 ] Rear view (pre-facelift, SWB) Interior Facelift [ edit ] Facelift (Santa Fe Sport) Rear view (facelift, SWB) North America [ edit ] The Santa Fe Sport went on sale in June 2012 as a 2013 model. It was available with two engines, and multiple packages that add many features. Engine choices are either a 2.4-litre petrol GDi engine, or a 2.0-litre turbocharged engine, offered as the 2.4 and 2.0T trim levels respectively. In Canada, only the 2.0T engine was available.

[ 45 ] The longer Santa Fe receives a unique grille design, optional 19-inch alloy wheels, flush dual exhaust tips, and a body shape that accentuates the crossover's added passenger and cargo room hind-wise from the B-pillar. In some markets, the long-wheelbase Santa Fe is also marketed as the Grand Santa Fe. Hyundai Grand Santa Fe (pre-facelift) Hyundai Maxcruz (pre-facelift) 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe (facelift) 2018 Hyundai Santa Fe (facelift) North America [ edit ] The long-wheelbase is offered in North America exclusively with a 3.3-litre, 290 hp (294 PS; 216 kW) V6 petrol engine, the highest output of any vehicle in its class at the time. The Santa Fe in the U.S. is available in two distinct trim levels: the SE (called the GLS until the 2016 model year), and the Limited. As the fourth generation Santa Fe was released in 2018 for the 2019 model year in North America, replacing the Santa Fe Sport, the long-wheelbase Santa Fe (previously simply called the Santa Fe) was renamed Santa Fe XL , in the USA (having been named that in Canada from the model's inception). In 2019, the Santa Fe XL was replaced by the Palisade .

The fourth-generation Santa Fe is a two-row SUV which succeeds the previous short-wheelbase Santa Fe (marketed in North America as the Santa Fe Sport). Compared to the third-generation short-wheelbase model, the fourth-generation model is longer by 80 mm (3.1 in), wider by 10 mm (0.4 in) with a 65 mm (2.6 in) longer wheelbase. [ 58 ] The longer wheelbase generated more legroom for passengers in the second and third row. In the second row, legroom is increased by 38 mm (1.5 in) and the seat is 18 mm (0.7 in) higher. Third row seats are optional in several markets, standard in some other markets and not available in regions such as North America. A new one-touch seat folding function is included for easy access to the third row seats, which has a 22 mm (0.9 in) larger headroom. However, Hyundai said the third-row is best for "occasional use". [ 59 ] Hyundai also claimed rearward visibility is improved due to the larger rear quarter glass that is 41 percent larger than the previous generation. Cargo room is 130 litres (4.6 cu ft) with all seats rows up, 547 litres (19.3 cu ft) with the third row folded down (previously 516 litres (18.2 cu ft)), and 1,625 litres (57.4 cu ft) with the second and third seats folded (previously 1,615 litres (57.0 cu ft)). The steering of the Santa Fe has been tuned to be more responsive, and the upgraded suspension is stiffer and angled more vertically for longer travel length. As the result, vehicle stability is enhanced while comfort, NVH and overall quietness is claimed to improve. Road noise is also reduced through the use of more sound deadening materials. A self-load-levelling suspension is optional, which continuously adjusts ride height regardless of vehicle load. The fourth-generation model is also built with extensive application of high-tensile strength steel, more than any other Hyundai vehicle during its introduction with 57 percent, or 15 percent more than the older model. [ 58 ] Rear view Interior Facelift [ edit ] On 3 June 2020, Hyundai revealed the facelifted Santa Fe for the 2021 model year. The facelifted Santa Fe was stated to be built on a newer N3 platform , allowing hybrid and plug-in hybrid models to be offered. [ 60 ] With the new platform, Hyundai claimed an expanded use of high-tensile steels in its body structure, while undercovers for the subframe, engine compartment, and cabin floors results in an improvement of the coefficient of drag from 0.34 to 0.33. [ 61 ] The updated Santa Fe features "T-shaped" LED lights that merge into a newer and wider "cascading grille ". The rear has also been revised, with a long reflective strip running across the width of the car. Wider wheel arches have been engineered to accommodate the larger 20-inch wheels. The vehicle has a redesigned centre stack with a shift-by-wire , push-button gear selector as well as a new drive mode selector. [ 60 ] It also has a 10.25-inch touchscreen and the driver has a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster. [ 62 ] 2021 Hyundai Santa Fe PHEV (facelift) Rear view Interior Markets [ edit ] Australia [ edit ] The fourth-generation Santa Fe was launched in Australia in June 2018. Initial trim levels included the Active, Elite and Highlander with a choice of two engines – a 2.4-litre four-cylinder petrol and 2.2-litre four-cylinder turbodiesel, while the V6 engine option from the previous generation was dropped. [ 63 ] The V6 engine option was reintroduced with the 3.5-litre MPi petrol in 2020. [ 64 ] The facelifted model was released in December 2020, with base, Active, Elite and Highlander trim levels, while the 2.2-litre diesel engine was updated. [ 65 ] China [ edit ] The Chinese market fourth-generation Santa Fe was introduced in 2019 (called "Shengda" (胜达) in Chinese), featuring a restyled rear end similar to the eighth-generation Sonata . The Chinese version is 160 mm (6.3 in) longer than the international version, and featuring a 100 mm (3.9 in) longer wheelbase. [ 66 ] Hyundai Santa Fe (LWB, China) Hyundai Santa Fe (LWB, China) Hyundai Santa Fe Facelift (LWB, China) Hyundai Santa Fe Facelift (LWB, China) Europe [ edit ] In Europe, three engines were offered: a 2.0-litre diesel, 152 hp (154 PS; 113 kW) or 180 hp (182 PS; 134 kW), a 2.2-litre diesel (197 hp (200 PS; 147 kW)) and a 2.4-litre petrol engine (185 hp (188 PS; 138 kW)). [ clarification needed ] The engines are offered with 6- or 8-speed automatic transmissions. Malaysia [ edit ] The fourth-generation Santa Fe was launched in Malaysia as an imported model in May 2019. Initial trim levels included the Executive and Premium with a choice of two engines – a 2.4-litre four-cylinder petrol and 2.2-litre four-cylinder turbodiesel.

[ 68 ] North America [ edit ] The fourth-generation Santa Fe was announced for the North American market at the 2018 New York International Auto Show and arrived in North American dealerships starting in mid-2018 as a 2019 model. [ 69 ] The fourth-generation model replaced the two-row Santa Fe which was previously marketed as the Santa Fe Sport. The long-wheelbase, three-row, seven-passenger version previously marketed simply as the "Santa Fe" remained on sale for the 2019 model year as the Santa Fe XL. [ 70 ] Its replacement, the Palisade, debuted in 2018 as a 2020 model. Initial trim levels included the SE, SEL, SEL Plus, Limited and Ultimate. [ 71 ] Engine choices in the region include a base 2.4-litre naturally aspirated GDi petrol engine with 185 hp (188 PS; 138 kW), and a more powerful 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol generating 235 hp (238 PS; 175 kW). A 2.2-litre diesel version of the Santa Fe with three-row seating was intended to be sold the United States for the 2019 model year, but was cancelled before launch. [ 72 ] [ 73 ] The refreshed model was released in October 2020 for the 2021 model year. The new entry-level motor is a 2.5-litre Smartstream petrol engine, replacing the 2.4-litre engine, and producing 191 hp (194 PS; 142 kW). The 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine was replaced by the 2.5-litre Smartstream turbocharged petrol engine which generates 277 hp (281 PS; 207 kW). Hybrid and plug-in hybrid engines are also offered for the first time, which uses 1.6-litre turbocharged petrol engine paired with an electric motor and lithium-ion polymer battery. [ 61 ] The enhanced blind-spot safety tech became standard on the Limited trim, and the Ultimate trim was removed and replaced by the new "Calligraphy" trim, similar to the Palisade . [ 74 ] Pakistan [ edit ] Initially, the Santa Fe was launched in Pakistan as an imported model in February 2019 and was offered in only a single trim level. [ 75 ] However, the local assembly of the fourth-generation facelifted Santa Fe commenced in Pakistan in October 2023. The vehicle comes in two hybrid variants: Smart (FWD) and Signature (AWD). Both variants come with the 1.6 L Smartstream G 1.6 T-GDi I4 hybrid powertrain. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Philippines [ edit ] The facelifted Santa Fe was launched in the Philippines on 20 June 2022 and went on sale in dealerships on 17 August 2022. [ 76 ] It is only offered in one trim which is the GLS, it is paired with Smartstream D 2.2-litre diesel engine matted to a 8-speed DCT .

[ 98 ] Developed under the codename MX5, Hyundai designed the vehicle to appeal to the growing outdoor lifestyle globally by adopting a boxy design. [ 99 ] Its exterior elements were designed to reduce the drag coefficient to just 0.29 (0.33 on the previous generation). [ 100 ] The model is 55 mm (2.2 in) longer than the outgoing model, with the same width. The 2,815 mm (110.8 in) wheelbase is 50 mm (2.0 in) longer than the previous generation. [ 101 ] The headlamps and tail lamps take on an H-shaped design, with a light bar spanning the width of the front end in the centre of the grille. The tail lamps are positioned at the bottom of the liftgate directly above the rear bumper. It also sports angular wheel arches on the fenders. [ 102 ] The Santa Fe will also become Hyundai's first extended-range electric vehicle . Reports from ETNews suggests the EREV version of the Santa Fe will start production in 2026 and start sales in 2027. A prototype version was spotted on 24 November 2025 and is based on the North American version (codenamed MX5a), likely meaning the EREV version will be produced in Montgomery, Alabama, United States. [ 103 ] Rear view Interior Santa Fe XRT Ensuring spacious interior space and large cargo volume, Hyundai chose to design the SUV starting from the rear. A higher roofline increased headroom space for second row occupants. Second-row legroom is rated 1,075 mm (42.3 in) for petrol variants (+35 mm (1.4 in) over the older Santa Fe) and 1,055 mm (41.5 in) for the hybrid. Third-row legroom is rated 761 mm (30.0 in) (+15 mm (0.6 in)), while headroom is 958 mm (37.7 in) (+69 mm (2.7 in)) and seat height is 282 mm (11.1 in) (+30 mm (1.2 in)). The third-row seats also recline by 10 degrees. Hyundai also claims a 725-litre cargo capacity for the SUV. [ 104 ] The tailgate was also specifically designed to allow a large opening by repositioning the struts. As a consequence, the taillights had to be relocated downwards. "When you have a tail lamp like a conventional car, you have a tail lamp up [higher]) and the strut has to move inboard [on the tailgate]. This really reduces the width of the tailgate quite significantly. Therefore we deliberately bring the taillight under the strut," according to SangYup Lee, Hyundai's global head of design. [ 105 ] Hyundai relocated the shift lever to the steering column, which allows the centre console to host two wireless phone charging pads, and a pair of cupholders. [ 106 ] A Panoramic Curved Display which combines the 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster and infotainment system into one curved screen is also a new addition. [ 107 ] [ 108 ] The previous generation Santa Fe architecture and major suspension components is retained for this generation, although the cooling system, component friction and other parameters have been revised. Available powertrain options include a 2.5-litre petrol, 2.5-litre turbocharged petrol, 1.6-litre turbocharged hybrid and 1.6-litre turbocharged plug-in hybrid.
