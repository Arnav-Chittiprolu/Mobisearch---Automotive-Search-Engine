From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Battery electric small family car Motor vehicle MG4 EV Overview Manufacturer SAIC Motor Production 2022–present Body and chassis Class Small family car ( C ) [ 1 ] Body style 5-door hatchback The MG4 EV or MG4 Electric is a battery electric small family car ( C-segment ) produced by the Chinese automotive manufacturer SAIC Motor under the British MG marque . First released in June 2022 as the MG Mulan in China (renamed MG4 EV in August 2023), [ 2 ] it was introduced in Europe in July 2022. [ 3 ] In March 2025, MG Motor introduced a second model of the MG4 EV to the Chinese market. It adopts a different design, has a larger footprint, and is based on a different platform. Outside China, the model will be sold alongside the existing MG4 EV model. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] First generation (EH32; 2022) [ edit ] Motor vehicle First generation Overview Model code EH32 [ 6 ] Also called MG Mulan (China, 2022–2023) Production 2022–present Assembly China: Ningde, Fujian [ 7 ] Thailand: Laem Chabang ( SAIC-CP , since 2023) [ 8 ] Indonesia: Cikarang, West Java ( SGMW Indonesia , since 2024) Taiwan: Taoyuan ( CMC , since 2024) Body and chassis Layout Rear-motor, rear-wheel-drive Dual-motor, all-wheel-drive Platform Modular Scalable Platform [ 1 ] / Nebula [ 9 ] Related MGS5 EV / ES5 Powertrain Electric motor Permanent magnet synchronous Power output 125–180 kW (168–241 hp; 170–245 PS) ( RWD ) 320 kW (429 hp; 435 PS) ( AWD ) Battery 49–51 kWh LFP 64–77 kWh NMC lithium-ion Range 350–520 km (217–323 mi) ( WLTP ) Plug-in charging DC : 88 kW (49–51 kWh battery) 140 kW (64 kWh battery) 144 kW (77 kWh battery) Dimensions Wheelbase 2,705 mm (106.5 in) Length 4,287 mm (168.8 in) Width 1,836 mm (72.3 in) Height 1,504–1,516 mm (59.2–59.7 in) Kerb weight 1,635–1,803 kg (3,605–3,975 lb) The EH32 MG4 EV is the first vehicle to be based on SAIC's battery-electric Modular Scalable Platform (marketed as the Nebula platform in China). The MG4 EV was developed under the codename EH32. [ 6 ] It was developed as a global model with the European market set as the primary target. [ 10 ] The model was part of a collaboration between SAIC Motor Design Center in Shanghai, the Advanced Design Studio in London and the Royal College of Art . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Based on the Modular Scalable Platform built ground-up specifically for battery electric vehicles, the MG4 EV has a wheelbase longer than typical cars in the segment, short overhangs and only a very short front bonnet . [ 12 ] It is claimed to have a 50:50 weight distribution and a low centre of gravity of 490 mm (19.3 in) for superior handling. The model has an active air intake grille to achieve a low drag coefficient of 0.279. [ 13 ] MG also engineered a thinner and flatter battery compared to typical battery electric vehicles with its "One Pack" battery system (called Rubik's Cube battery system in China), with a cell-to-pack (CTP) technology. The battery is only 110 mm (4.3 in) thick for the smallest capacity, which reduces the height of the car. The "One Pack" battery is also designed to be swappable. [ 14 ] A performance-oriented model, the XPower, was introduced in July 2023. [ 15 ] The Extended Range model with a 77 kWh battery and a 180 kW (241 hp; 245 PS) motor became available in Europe since August 2023. [ 16 ] Since this period, the MG4 EV became equipped with a rear wiper, which was not included previously. Some variants also gained a larger 18-inch wheels with a new design. [ 17 ] Rear view Interior MG4 EV XPower [ edit ] A dual-motor, all-wheel-drive , performance-oriented model of the MG4 EV called XPower has been available since July 2023. It was marketed in China as the MG Mulan Triumph Edition. Exterior changes compared to the standard MG4 include a 18-inch alloy wheels, orange-painted XPower brake calipers , trim accents, and a Racing Green exterior paint option. [ 18 ] The powertrain combines dual electric motors, 150 kW (201 hp; 204 PS) at the front and 170 kW (228 hp; 231 PS) at the rear– for a combined output of 320 kW (429 hp; 435 PS) and 600 N⋅m (61.2 kg⋅m; 443 lb⋅ft) of torque. It is equipped with Dynamic Cornering Control System that combines an electronic locking differential with torque vectoring . MG claimed a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) acceleration figure in 3.8 seconds. It also uses a modified chassis setup, by using a 25 percent stiffer suspension with recalibrated spring and dampers and stiffer anti-roll-bars , sharper steering, larger 345 mm (13.6 in) disc brakes , and a stronger setting for the regenerative braking . [ 15 ] MG4 EV XPower Rear view MG EX4 [ edit ] MG EX4 At the 2023 Goodwood Festival of Speed , MG revealed the EX4, a one-off tribute designed to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the MG Metro 6R4 rally car of the 1980s. [ 19 ] Based on the MG4 XPower and using the same 320 kW (429 hp; 435 PS) dual electric motor powertrain as the XPower, the EX4 was designed in collaboration with high performance engineering company RML Group , featuring widened wheel arches, aero disc wheels, a front splitter and a large rear spoiler, much like the original 6R4. [ 20 ] The EX4 was driven by BTCC driver Daniel Rowbottom in demonstration runs up the Goodwood hill-climb course. [ 21 ] Markets [ edit ] Australia [ edit ] The first-generation MG4 EV went on sale in Australia in August 2023.

Top Gear highlighted the car's value, stating it "has range, charging, and zippy dynamics" at a lower price compared to competitors like the Volkswagen ID.3 . However, it noted that the seats could be uncomfortable for larger people, and the infotainment system stutters occasionally. [ 54 ] Autocar commended its handling and ride quality but mentioned the cabin noise insulation could be better. [ 55 ] The Auto Express review appreciated its affordability, with solid range and driving dynamics, but pointed out the lack of premium materials in the interior as a downside. [ 56 ] Sales [ edit ] In 2023, the MG4 is the second best-selling EV in the United Kingdom, below the Tesla Model Y . [ 57 ] With 138,736 units exported from China, the MG4 EV was also the most exported Chinese EV in 2023.

[ 79 ] The semi-solid-state battery version went on sale in late 2025. [ 80 ] Outside China, the model is marketed alongside the rear-wheel drive MG4 EV, as the MG4 EV Urban . [ 81 ] Unlike most global-market previous generation MG4 uses a rear-wheel drive and all-wheel drive , the model is based on the SAIC E3 electric vehicle architecture using a cell-to-body battery design with only available in front-wheel drive . [ 82 ] [ 83 ] SAIC Motor chief designer Shao Jingfeng said that the new MG4's exterior styling includes styling elements from the Cyberster while balancing Chinese and international design preferences. [ 84 ] The dashboard has a 15.6-inch 2.5K-resolution central infotainment touchscreen powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8155 SoC . The infotainment system uses MG's new operating system co-developed with Oppo , with features such as smartphone mirroring, voice functions, and gesture-capable navigation. It can interface with smartphones to synchronize their apps and update, with compatibility with Android , Xiaomi , Huawei , and Apple devices. [ 85 ] [ 86 ] [ 87 ] The MG4 has a 471-litre (16.6 cu ft) rear cargo area, with an additional 98 litres (3.5 cu ft) underneath the floor. [ 80 ] It has a MacPherson strut front suspension and a torsion beam suspension at the rear. [ 88 ] Rear view Interior Powertrain [ edit ] The MG4 EV is equipped with a single choice of drivetrain, a single front-wheel drive motor outputting 120 kW (161 hp; 163 PS) and 250 N⋅m (184 lb⋅ft) of torque. At launch, it will have the option of two LFP battery packs supplied by REPT Battero with capacities of 42.8 or 54.0 kWh providing 437 km (272 mi) and 530 km (329 mi) of CLTC range, respectively. It has a top speed of 160 km/h (99 mph) and both batteries can charge from 30–80% in 20 minutes. [ 85 ] Semi-solid state battery [ edit ] MG says the MG4 will be available with an optional semi- solid-state battery supplied by QingTao Energy . [ 89 ] The company said that only 5% of the battery's electrolyte will be liquid, resulting in an energy density of 180Wh/kg. Additionally, MG claims the battery passes puncture safety tests and provides 13.8% better range retention at −7 °C (19 °F) than conventional LFP battery chemistries. It will have a capacity of approximately 70 kWh and a CLTC range rating of 537 km (334 mi). [ 90 ] MIIT documents released in August 2025 reveal that the semi-solid state battery version of the MG4 will be called the Anxin Edition, and will use a "manganese-based lithium-ion battery", likely a lithium-ion manganese oxide (LMO) cathode chemistry.
