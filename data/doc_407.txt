Events are held on road circuits sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme (FIM). Independent motorcycle racing events have been held since the start of the twentieth century, when large national events were often given the title Grand Prix. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] In 1949, the FIM was founded as the international governing body for motorcycle sport, and it coordinated rules so that select events could become part of official World Championships. Grand Prix road racing is the oldest established motorsport world championship . [ 3 ] Grand Prix motorcycles are purpose-built racing machines that are unavailable for purchase by the general public and unable to be ridden legally on public roads . This contrasts with the various production-based categories of racing, such as the Superbike World Championship and the Isle of Man TT Races , that feature modified versions of road-going motorcycles available to the public. The top division in Grand Prix racing was originally known as 500cc . Since 2002, the start of the four-stroke era, it has been known as MotoGP .  The modern championship is divided into three official classes: MotoGP, Moto2, and Moto3. While 500cc/MotoGP is recognised as the premier class World Championship, all classes hold official status. All three classes now use four-stroke engines . The most successful rider across all Grand Prix classes is Giacomo Agostini , with 15 titles and 122 race wins. Agostini also holds the premier class title record, with eight championships, followed by Valentino Rossi and active rider Marc Márquez with seven each. As of 2025 , Rossi holds the record for most premier class race wins, with 89. History [ edit ] An FIM Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix was first organized by the Fédération Internationale de Motocyclisme in 1949. The commercial rights are now owned by Dorna Sports , with the FIM remaining as the sport sanctioning body. Teams are represented by the International Road Racing Teams Association (IRTA) and manufacturers by the Motorcycle Sport Manufacturers Association (MSMA). Rules and changes to regulations are decided between the four entities, with Dorna casting a tie-breaking vote. In cases of technical modifications, the MSMA can unilaterally enact or veto changes by unanimous vote among its members. [ 4 ] These four entities compose the Grand Prix Commission. There have traditionally been several races at each event for various classes of motorcycles, based on engine size , and one class for sidecars . Classes for 50cc, 80cc, 125cc, 250cc, 350cc, 500cc, and 750cc solo machines have existed at some time, and 350cc and 500cc sidecars. Up through the 1950s and most of the 1960s, four-stroke engines dominated all classes. In the 1960s, due to advances in engine design and technology, two-stroke engines began to take root in the smaller classes. In 1969, the FIM—citing high development costs for non-works teams due to rules which allowed a multiplicity of cylinders (meaning smaller pistons, producing higher revs) and a multiplicity of gears (giving narrower power bands, affording higher states of tune)—brought in new rules restricting all classes to six gears and most to two cylinders (four cylinders in the case of the 350cc and 500cc classes). This led to a mass walk-out of the sport by the previously highly successful Honda , Suzuki and Yamaha manufacturer teams, skewing the results tables for the next several years, with MV Agusta effectively the only works team left in the sport until Yamaha (1973) and Suzuki (1974) returned with new two-stroke designs. By this time, two-strokes completely eclipsed the four-strokes in all classes. In 1979, Honda , on its return to GP racing, made an attempt to return the four-stroke to the top class with the NR500 , but this project failed, and, in 1983, even Honda was winning with a two-stroke 500. Previously, the championship featured a 50cc class from 1962 to 1983, later changed to an 80cc class from 1984 to 1989. The class was dropped for the 1990 season, after being dominated primarily by Spanish and Italian makers. It also featured a 350cc class from 1949 to 1982, and a 750cc class from 1977 to 1979. Sidecars were dropped from World Championship events after 1996 (see Sidecar World Championship ). From the mid-1970s through to 2001, the top class of GP racing allowed 500cc displacement with a maximum of four cylinders, regardless of whether the engine was a two-stroke or four-stroke . This is unlike TT Formula or motocross , where two and four strokes had different engine size limits in the same class to provide similar performance. Consequently, all machines were two-strokes, since they produce power with every rotation of the crank, whereas four-stroke engines produce power only every second rotation. Some two- and three-cylinder two-stroke 500s were seen, but though they had a minimum-weight advantage under the rules, typically attained higher corner speed and could qualify well, they lacked the power of the four-cylinder machines. In 2002, rule changes were introduced to facilitate the phasing out of the 500cc two-strokes. The premier class was rebranded MotoGP, as manufacturers were to choose between running two-stroke engines up to 500cc or four-strokes up to 990cc or less. Manufacturers were also permitted to employ their choice of engine configuration . Despite the increased costs of the new four-stroke engines, they were soon able to dominate their two-stroke rivals. As a result, by 2003 no two-stroke machines remained in the MotoGP field. The 125cc and 250cc classes still consisted exclusively of two-stroke machines. In 2007, the MotoGP class had its maximum engine displacement capacity reduced to 800cc for a minimum of five years. In 2009, during the Great Recession , in an effort to cut costs, MotoGP underwent changes including reducing Friday practice sessions and testing sessions, extending the lifespan of engines, switching to a single tyre manufacturer, and banning qualifying tyres, active suspension, launch control and ceramic composite brakes. [ 5 ] For the 2010 season, carbon brake discs were banned. For the 2012 season, the MotoGP engine capacity was increased again to 1,000cc. [ 6 ] It also saw the introduction of Claiming Rule Teams (CRT), which were given more engines per season and larger fuel tanks than factory teams, but were subject to a factory team buying ("claiming") their rival's powertrain for a fixed price. [ 7 ] The sport's governing body received applications from sixteen new teams looking to join the MotoGP class. [ 8 ] For the 2014 season, the CRT subclass was rebranded Open, as the claiming rule was removed. Also, all entries adopted a standard engine control unit, with factory teams being allowed to run any software, and Open entries using a standard software. For the 2016 season, the Open subclass was dropped, and factory entries switched to a standard engine control unit software. In 2010, the 250cc two-stroke class was replaced by the new Moto2 600cc four-stroke class. [ 9 ] In 2012, the 125cc two-stroke class was replaced by the Moto3 250cc four-stroke class with a weight limit of 65 kg with fuel. [ 10 ] For the 2019 season Moto2 introduced the 3-cylinder, 765cc Triumph production engine, while Moto3 and MotoGP still use prototype engines. MotoE was introduced in 2019 as a "World Cup" until 2022 [ 11 ] and gained World Championship status only from 2023 until 2025 , because MotoE class on hiatus after the 2025 season.

[ 29 ] 2025: A hiatus is announced for the MotoE class after the 2025 season. [ 12 ] Event format [ edit ] The starting grid consists of three columns and features around 20 riders. Grid positions are determined based on qualifying speeds, arranged in descending order, with the fastest rider occupying the pole . Each race is a 45-minute sprint, completed without any fuel or tyre stops. In 2005, a flag-to-flag rule for MotoGP was introduced. Previously, if a race started dry and rain fell, officials could red-flag (stop) the race and either restart or resume on 'wet' tyres. Now, when rain falls, a white flag is shown, indicating that riders can pit to swap the motorcycle on which they started the race for an identical one, as long as the tyres are different (that is, intermediates or wets instead of slicks). [ 30 ] Besides different tyres, the wet-weather bikes have steel brake rotors and different brake pads instead of the carbon discs and pads used on the 'dry' bikes. This is because the carbon brakes need to be very hot to function properly, and the water cools them too much. The suspension is also 'softened' up somewhat for the wet weather. When a rider crashes, track marshals up the track from the incident wave yellow flags, prohibiting overtaking in that area; one corner farther up the track, a stationary yellow flag is shown. If a fallen rider cannot be evacuated safely from the track, the race is red-flagged. Motorcycle crashes are usually one of two types: lowside , when the bike loses either front or rear tyre grip and slides out on the "low" side, and the more dangerous highside , when the tyres do not completely slide out, but instead grip the track surface, flipping the bike over to the "high side", usually catapulting the rider over the top. Increased use of traction control has made highsides much less frequent. 2023 saw the introduction of 'sprint' race events; these races take place on the Saturday of the race weekend, with the traditional Grand Prix taking place on the Sunday. The 'sprint' races are shorter - approximately half the length of a Grand Prix. Riders score approximately half the points of a full race in the sprints.

Giacomo Agostini is the most successful champion in Grand Prix history, with 15 titles to his name (8 in the 500cc class and 7 in the 350cc class). The most dominant rider of all time was Mike Hailwood , winning 10 out of 12 (83%) races, in the 250cc class, in the 1966 season. Mick Doohan , who won 12 out of 15 (80%) of the 500cc races in the 1997 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season , also deserves an honourable mention. Valentino Rossi and Marc Márquez are the most successful contemporary riders: they have both won nine championships, seven in the 500cc/MotoGP class and one each in the 250cc/Moto2 and 125cc classes. [ 33 ] The current premier class champion is Marc Márquez. Circuits [ edit ] Main article: List of Grand Prix motorcycle circuits Countries marked in green are due to host Grands Prix in this season - those in red have hosted GP races in the past The 2026 MotoGP World Championship consists of 22 circuits.

In the 2005 season, Rule 2.10.5 was introduced: 'No fuel on the motorcycle may be more than 15 °C below ambient temperature . The use of any device on the motorcycle to artificially decrease the temperature of the fuel below ambient temperature is forbidden. No motorcycle may include such a device.' This stops an artificial "boost" gained from increasing fuel density by cooling it. MotoGP class [ edit ] Shortened 2025 MotoGP logo Francesco Bagnaia , riding a Ducati Desmosedici , at Sepang (2025) Lorenzo Savadori , riding an Aprilia RS-GP , at Sepang (2025) Brad Binder , riding a KTM RC16 , at Sepang (2025) Luca Marini , riding a Honda RC213V , at Sepang (2025) Fabio Quartararo , riding a Yamaha YZR-M1 , at Sepang (2025) At the beginning of the new MotoGP era in 2002, 500cc two-stroke or 990cc four-stroke bikes were specified to race. The enormous power advantage of the twice as large displacement four-stroke engine over the half the size two-stroke meant that by the following season, no two-stroke bikes were racing. In 2007, the maximum engine capacity was reduced to 800cc without reducing the existing weight restriction. MotoGP-class motorcycles are not restricted to any specific engine configuration. However, the number of cylinders employed in the engine determines the motorcycle's permitted minimum weight; the weight of the extra cylinders acts as a form of handicap . This is necessary because, for a given capacity, an engine with more cylinders is capable of producing more power. If comparable bore to stroke ratios are employed, an engine with more cylinders will have a greater piston area and a shorter stroke. The increased piston area permits an increase in the total valve area, allowing more air and fuel to be drawn into the engine, and the shorter stroke permits higher revs at the same piston speed, allowing the engine to pump still more air and fuel with the potential to produce more power, but with more fuel consumption too. In 2004 motorcycles were entered with three-, four-and five-cylinder configurations. A six-cylinder engine was proposed by Blata, but it did not reach the MotoGP grids. Presently four-cylinder engines appear to offer the best compromise between weight, power, and fuel consumption as all competitors in the 2009 series used this solution in either 'V' or in-line configuration. In 2002, the FIM became concerned about the advances in design and engineering that resulted in higher speeds around the race track ; regulation changes related to weight, amount of available fuel and engine capacity were introduced. The amended rules reduced engine capacity to 800cc from 990cc and restricted the amount of available fuel for race distance from 26 litres (5.7 imp gal; 6.9 US gal) in year 2004 to 21 litres (4.6 imp gal; 5.5 US gal) in year 2007 and onwards. In addition, the minimum weight of four-cylinder bikes used by all participating teams was increased by 3 kg (6.6 lb). The top speed in the history of MotoGP is 366.1 km/h (227.5 mph), set by Brad Binder and Pol Espargaró at Mugello Circuit , both with a KTM RC16 . On 11 December 2009, the Grand Prix Commission announced that the MotoGP class would switch to the 1,000cc motor limit starting in the 2012 season. Maximum displacement was limited to 1,000cc, maximum cylinders were limited to four, and maximum bore was capped at 81 mm (3.2 inches). [ 34 ] Carmelo Ezpeleta, the CEO of Dorna Sports , indicated that the projected changes were received by the teams favorably. [ 35 ] From 2012, teams not entered by one of the major manufacturers could seek "claiming rule team" (CRT) status. Claiming rule team were intended to allow independent teams to be competitive at a lower cost and increase the number of entries in MotoGP. Claiming rule teams benefitted from less restrictive rules on the number of engines that could be used in a season, and with larger fuel allowances during the races. Under the claiming rule, CRTs agree to allow up to four of their engines per season to be claimed, after a race, by one of the major manufacturer teams at a cost of €20,000 each including transmission, or €15,000 each for the engine alone. [ 36 ] From the 2014 season, the CRT class was dropped in favour of an "Open Class" specification - allowing teams using the control ECU hardware and software certain benefits to increase their competitiveness. [ 37 ] From 2023, front ride height – or holeshot – devices were banned. These devices have been common place in MotoGP since the back-end of 2018, when Ducati first introduced a system that could lower the rear of its bike to help with acceleration off the line for race starts. [ 38 ] From 2027, all ride height devices will be banned. Maximum displacement will be 850cc and aerodynamics will be more tightly regulated. Motorcycles will use 100% sustainable fuel, up from 40% sustainable fuel the sport has used since 2024. GPS data for all riders will be available after each session. All teams will have their concession rank reset to B. [ 39 ] Moto2 class [ edit ] Marcos Ramírez , riding a Kalex Moto2, at Sepang (2024) Moto2 was initially a 600cc four-stroke class introduced in 2010 to replace the traditional 250cc two-stroke class. Engines were supplied exclusively by Honda, tyres by Dunlop and electronics are limited and supplied only by FIM-sanctioned producers. Carbon brake discs are banned, only steel brake discs are allowed. However, there are no chassis limitations. Until 2019, only 600cc four-stroke Moto2 machines were allowed. [ 40 ] In 2019 Triumph replaced Honda as the sole supplier of Moto2 engines. [ 41 ] The Triumph's engine configuration is 765cc displacement with three cylinders, contrasting with the previous Honda's 600cc in-line four. In 2024 Pirelli became the sole tyre supplier in Moto2 and Moto3, replacing Dunlop. [ 42 ] Moto3 class [ edit ] KTM motorcycle of Ángel Piqueras in Moto3, at Mugello (2025) The 125cc class was replaced in 2012 by the Moto3 class. This class is restricted to single-cylinder 250cc four-stroke engines with a maximum bore of 81 mm (3.2 inches). The minimum total weight for motorcycle and rider is 148 kg (326 lb). Traditionally, the age limits for Moto3 were 16-28, with an upper limit of 25 for new contracted riders participating for the first time and wild-cards. A change of rules was introduced in 2014, allowing under-age FIM CEV Repsol Moto3 (junior) champions to participate in a subsequent Moto3 series at World Championship level. [ 43 ] The first beneficiary of this rule-change was double (2013 and 2014) CEV champion Fabio Quartararo . However, after a rash of incidents involving young rider fatalities in lower classes, the FIM set a minimum age of 18 starting in the 2023 season.

From 2007 onwards, and for a minimum period of five years, FIM has regulated in MotoGP class that two-stroke bikes will no longer be allowed. The maximum fuel capacity is to be 21 litres (4.6 imp gal; 5.5 US gal). From 2007 to 2011, engines were limited to 800cc four-strokes. In 2012 engine displacement was increased to 1000cc [ 56 ] For the 2013 season minimum weight was increased to 160 kg (350 lb). In 2014, fuel tank capacity was reduced from 21 litres to 20 litres (4.4 imp gal; 5.3 US gal) for the Factory Entries, and was increased to 24 litres for the Open Entries. For the 2015 season minimum weight was decreased to 158 kg (348 lb) [ 57 ] In 2016, fuel tank capacity was mandated at 22 litres for all classes. Tyres [ edit ] Tyre selection is critical, usually done by the individual rider based on bike 'feel' during practice, qualifying and the pre-race warm-up laps on the morning of the race, as well as the predicted weather. The typical compromise is between grip and longevity—softer compound tyres have more traction, but wear out more quickly; harder compound tyres have less traction, but are more likely to last the entire race. Conserving rubber throughout a race is a specific skill winning riders acquire. Special 'Q' or qualifying tyres of extreme softness and grip were typically used during grid-qualifying sessions until their use was discontinued at the end of the 2008 season, but they lasted typically no longer than one or two laps, though they could deliver higher qualifying speeds. In wet conditions, special tyres ('wets') with full treads are used, but they suffer extreme wear if the track dries out. In 2007 new MotoGP regulations limited the number of tyres any rider could use over the practice and qualifying period, and the race itself, to a maximum of 31 tyres (14 fronts and 17 rears) per rider. This introduced a problem of tyre choice versus weather (among other factors) that challenges riders and teams to optimize their performance on race day. This factor was greeted with varying degrees of enthusiasm by participants. Bridgestone had dominated in 2007 and Michelin riders Valentino Rossi , Nicky Hayden , Dani Pedrosa , and Colin Edwards all acknowledged shortcomings in Michelin's race tyres relative to Bridgestone. Rossi, disappointed with and critical of the performance of his Michelin tyres, switched to Bridgestones for 2008 and won the world championship in dominant fashion. Pedrosa controversially switched to Bridgestones during the 2008 season. In 2008, the rules were amended to allow more tyres per race weekend—18 fronts and 22 rears for a total of 40 tyres. The lower number of tyres per weekend was considered a handicap to Michelin riders. The only MotoGP team using Dunlop Tyres in 2007, Yamaha Tech 3, did not use them in 2008 but switched to Michelin. For 2009, 2010 and 2011, a 'spec' tyre supplier, Bridgestone, was appointed by the FIM (with Michelin no longer supplying any tyres to MotoGP and returning to the category in 2016). For the whole season Bridgestone provided four specifications of front tyre, six of rear, and a single wet specification—with no qualifying specification. For each round Bridgestone provided only two specifications for front and rear. Tyres are assigned to riders randomly to assure impartiality. [ 58 ] Jorge Lorenzo has publicly supported the mono tyre rule. [ 59 ] At the end of the 2015 season, Bridgestone withdrew as tyre supplier of MotoGP. [ 60 ] Following a formal tender, French tyre manufacturer Michelin became the official supplier for the 2016 season, marking their return to the series and testing began in Aragon immediately after the end of the 2015 season. [ 61 ] After the first race of the 2025 season, it was announced that Pirelli will be the tyre supplier of MotoGP from 2027, which includes the Moto2 and Moto3 Championships using Pirelli since 2024. [ 62 ] In media [ edit ] Hitting the Apex , a documentary film about MotoGP, was released in 2015 and is now available on DVD. Faster , a documentary film about MotoGP, was released in 2003 and is now available on DVD. Fastest , a documentary film about MotoGP, was released in 2011 and is now available on DVD. MotoGP Unlimited , a documentary film about MotoGP, was released in 2022. [ 63 ] Video games [ edit ] See also: Category:Grand Prix motorcycle racing video games Early Grand Prix video games include Grand Prix 500cc (1987), Cycles: International GP Racing (1989), Grand Prix 500 2 (1991) and GP-1 (1993). The first simulator was GP 500 , launched in 1999. In the early 2000s, THQ published five video games for Windows and Xbox platforms, the first being MotoGP: Ultimate Racing Technology (2002) and the last MotoGP '07 (2007), whereas Namco of Japan published and in-house developed five video games for PlayStation platforms starting with MotoGP (2000) and ending with MotoGP (2006). In 2007, Capcom became the new PlayStation publisher and worked together with Italy-based Milestone to produce MotoGP '07 (PS2) and some of its successors. In 2008, THQ lost the MotoGP licence and Capcom became the exclusive publisher. [ 64 ] MotoGP 2010 , an iOS game made in 2010 by I-Play, released on 3 September 2010 and was not received well by critics after having a 43% rating on Metacritic. MotoGP 10/11 was released by Capcom on 15 March 2011, for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Metacritic gave the game a rating of 72%. [ 65 ] In 2013, Milestone got the exclusive license for MotoGP video games, a contract that will now last until at least 2026. [ 66 ] [ 67 ] The first game in this run of their contract was MotoGP 13 , which was released on 21 June 2013 on PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The game received mixed reviews and scored 73%. [ 68 ] As of May 2025 the latest release is MotoGP 25 on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Windows, Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One. [ 69 ] The game GPBikes allows players to ride Grand Prix bikes such as the Cagiva 500.
