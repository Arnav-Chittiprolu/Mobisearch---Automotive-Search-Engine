In 1948, Ghulam Mohammed decided to move to the newly formed Pakistan.The Mahindras were left with stationary and company stamp that said M&M. They did not have the financial resources to change the name. Since there were two Mahindra brothers in the business they decided to change the company name to Mahindra & Mahindra. [ 9 ] Beginnings with Jeep [ edit ] They eventually saw a business opportunity in expanding into manufacturing and selling larger multi utility vehicle (MUVs) and started assembling under the licence of Willys Jeep in India. Soon, M&M was established as the Jeep manufacturer in India and later commenced manufacturing light commercial vehicles (LCVs) and agricultural tractors . Jeep was bought by American Motors Corporation in 1970; Jeeps continued to be built by Mahindra under licence from AMC and, in turn, under Chrysler after Chrysler bought AMC in 1987.

[ 64 ] Mahindra launched its relatively heavily publicized SUV, XUV500 , code-named as W201 in September 2011. The new SUV by Mahindra was designed in-house and it was developed on the first global SUV platform that could be used for developing more SUVs. In India, the new Mahindra XUV500 came in a price range between ₹ 1,140,000–1,500,000. The company was expected to launch three products in 2015 (two SUVs and one CV) and an XUV500 hybrid. Besides India, the company also targeted Europe, Africa, Australia and Latin America for this model. [ 65 ] Mahindra President Mr. Pawan Goenka stated that the company planned to launch six new models in the year. [ 66 ] The company launched the CNG version of its mini truck Maxximo on 29 June 2012. [ 67 ] A new version of the Verito in Diesel and petrol options was launched by the company on 26 July 2012 to compete with Maruti's Dzire and Toyota Kirloskar Motor 's Etios . [ 68 ] On 30 July 2015, Mahindra released sketches of a new compact SUV called the TUV300 slated to be launched on 10 September 2015.

[ 83 ] Mahindra announced it would import pickup trucks from India in knockdown kit (CKD) form to circumvent the Chicken tax . [ 84 ] CKDs are complete vehicles that were assembled in the United States from kits of parts shipped in crates. [ 84 ] On 18 October 2010, however, it was reported that Mahindra had indefinitely delayed the launch of vehicles into the North American market, citing legal issues between it and Global Vehicles after Mahindra retracted its contract with Global Vehicles earlier in 2010, due to a decision to sell the vehicles directly to consumers instead of through Global Vehicles. [ 85 ] However, a November 2010 report quoted John Perez, the CEO of Global Vehicles USA, as estimating that he expected Mahindra's small Diesel pickups to go on sale in the United States by spring 2011, although legal complications remained, and Perez, while hopeful, admitted that arbitration could take more than a year. [ 86 ] Later reports suggested that the delays may be due to Mahindra scrapping the original model of the truck and replacing it with an upgraded one before selling them to Americans. [ 87 ] In June 2012, a mass tort lawsuit was filed against Mahindra by its American dealers, alleging the company of conspiracy and fraud. [ 88 ] Mahindra Automotive North America (MANA), the company's U.S. subsidiary, opened a car manufacturing plant in Detroit, Michigan, on 20 November 2017.
