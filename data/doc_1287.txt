From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia American electric full-size SUV Motor vehicle Rivian R1S Overview Manufacturer Rivian Production 2022–present Model years 2022–present Assembly United States: Normal, Illinois ( Rivian Automotive LLC ) Designer Paul Hoste (2014) [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Body and chassis Body style 5-door SUV Doors 4 doors + 1 in rear Related Rivian R1T Powertrain Power output 402–1,025 hp (300–764 kW) Transmission Single-speed Hybrid drivetrain IWD 4x4 Battery 7,776 cells (2170 type) in a nine-module assembly for the 135 kWh liquid-cooled lithium-ion battery pack [ 3 ] 1 cell in door torch for 7,777 cells Electric range 316 miles (509 km) Dimensions Wheelbase 3,076 mm (121.1 in) [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Length 5,100 mm (200.8 in) [ 5 ] Width 2,014 mm (79.3 in) [ 5 ] Height 1,816–1,963 mm (71.5–77.3 in) [ 5 ] Curb weight 3,206 kg (7,068 lb) [ 5 ] The Rivian R1S is an all-electric , seven-passenger, full-size, [ 6 ] off-road SUV manufactured by Rivian . Customer deliveries started in 2022, [ 7 ] [ 8 ] after 10 years under development. [ 2 ] Depending on the configuration, it has either two, three, or four electric motors . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Design [ edit ] Rear view, Launch Edition With a 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) time of 3 seconds, due to its 835 hp (623 kW; 847 PS) combined output power, [ 11 ] the R1S shares 91% of its components with the company's R1T , [ 12 ] noted for its low center of gravity . [ 13 ] The vehicle is equipped for semi-autonomous driving according to level 3 and designed for road traffic and off-road driving. Powertrain [ edit ] As announced in 2018, the R1S was designed with three battery capacities and power outputs; all planned versions included four traction motors, [ 14 ] in which each wheel is driven by an independent traction motor, allowing full-time all-wheel drive with torque vectoring . [ 15 ] The quad-motor version (QM) uses electric traction motors developed by Robert Bosch GmbH , but these are carried on the vehicle's frame; the R1S does not use wheel hub motors like the Lordstown Endurance . [ 16 ] As delivered in 2022, the QM R1S has a combined output of 835 hp (623 kW) and 908 lb⋅ft (1,231 N⋅m), split 415 / 420 hp (309 / 313 kW) and 413 / 495 lb⋅ft (560 / 671 N⋅m) front/rear. [ 5 ] R1S configurations [ 14 ] [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Motors Battery (kW-hr) Dual-Motor (DM) Performance Dual-Motor (PDM) Quad-Motor (QM) Range Standard (105) 260 mi (420 km) N/A N/A Large (135) 340 mi (550 km) 321 mi (517 km) Max (149) 400 mi (640 km) 400 mi (640 km) N/A Output 533 hp (397 kW) & 610 lb⋅ft (827 N⋅m) [ 19 ] 665 hp (496 kW) & 829 lb⋅ft (1,124 N⋅m) [ 19 ] 835 hp (623 kW) & 908 lb⋅ft (1,231 N⋅m) [ 19 ] Rivian has announced plans to reduce prices by offering dual-motor (DM) versions starting in 2024, with independent traction motors for the front and rear axles, [ 15 ] using "Enduro" motors developed by Rivian for the EDV . [ 16 ] [ 20 ] DM versions will be offered with two different battery capacities (standard and large) for the R1S, [ 20 ] with slightly greater corresponding range as the weight and efficiency should improve with two motors. [ 15 ] Maximum output of the dual-motor version is expected to be >600 hp (450 kW) and >600 lb⋅ft (810 N⋅m), which is a decrease from the quad-motor version; [ 15 ] a "Performance Dual Motor" (PDM) option was added in April 2023, which raises output to approximately 700 hp (520 kW) through a software modification. [ 21 ] Production of the "Enduro" motor drive units began in February 2023; most have been used to ramp up EDV production, [ 20 ] but DM R1S SUVs with the Large battery pack were first delivered to customers in May 2023. [ 22 ] The extended range ("Max Pack") battery has been delayed until 2023. [ 23 ] In addition, the smaller ("Standard") battery is not scheduled to be delivered until 2024; the Standard battery will use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry to reduce costs by eliminating nickel and cobalt. [ 15 ] [ 24 ] Consumption and performance [ edit ] The 2022 Rivian R1S was rated by the EPA with a consumption of 69 mpg‑e (49 kW⋅h/100 mi) for the combined city+highway driving cycle and a total range of 316 mi (509 km) when equipped with the "Large" 135 kWh battery and quad-motor drivetrain. [ 25 ] Acceleration from 0 to 60 mph (97 km/h) was tested by Motor Trend in August 2022 at 3.1 seconds on all-season tires and 3.2 seconds on all-terrain tires. Corresponding 1 ⁄ 4 mi (0.40 km) elapsed times and trap speeds were 11.6 sec at 111.2 mph (179.0 km/h) on all-season tires, slowing to 11.8 sec at 111.6 mph (179.6 km/h) with all-terrain tires. [ 5 ] Storage and towing [ edit ] The frunk of a Rivian R1S Total enclosed cargo volume is 104.7 cu ft (2.96 m 3 ) when the second and third rows of seats are folded down. A "frunk" under the hood , where the engine is in most conventional internal combustion engine vehicles, adds 11.1 cu ft (0.31 m 3 ) of lockable storage. [ 26 ] In addition, there is a small compartment underneath the cargo floor. [ 5 ] Towing capacity is 7,700 lb (3,500 kg). [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Interior [ edit ] Interior Pet comfort mode maintains a user-selected temperature inside the car when the driver is away from the vehicle. [ 26 ] A five-passenger option deleting the third row was discontinued in March 2022 before production vehicles began to be delivered; all R1Ss are seven-passenger, three-row vehicles. [ 15 ] Third-row seating was reported to be "a little tight for adults", with low cushion height resulting in most people adopting a posture with knees higher than their hips. [ 5 ] In their review, Motor Trend reported that the glass roof was not equipped with a sunshade and the resulting insolation made its reviewers uncomfortable during comparison testing in the desert at temperatures exceeding 100 °F (38 °C). They also criticized the infotainment system, which is not equipped with Apple CarPlay or Android Auto . [ 29 ] Chassis [ edit ] The vehicle has an air suspension which allows for a maximum ground clearance of 14.9 in (380 mm), with individual wheels cross-linked to reduce body lean during cornering. In addition, there is a "Camp Mode" that allows the vehicle to level itself when parked on irregular terrain. [ 29 ] Maximum wading depth in water is 43.1 in (1.09 m). [ 30 ] Compared to the R1T, which has a 135.8 in (3,450 mm) wheelbase, the R1S rides on a shorter 121.1 in (3,080 mm) wheelbase and has a shorter rear overhang, improving departure and breakover angles . [ 28 ] This also results in a turning circle that is nearly 4 ft (1.2 m) smaller for the R1S. [ 31 ] Trim levels [ edit ] The entry-level trim was called the Explore package, which included matte-black interior finishes and heated vegan leather seats. [ 32 ] In August 2022, Rivian announced it had discontinued the Explore package [ 33 ] citing low demand, simplified assembly and supply chain constraints that would be alleviated with a single option. By eliminating the base trim, Rivian effectively increased prices. [ 32 ] The Adventure package upgrades the interior with heated and cooled perforated vegan leather seats, Chilewich woven floor mats, wood or vegan leather accents, and a premium Rivian Elevation sound system designed by Meridian Audio which includes a removable Bluetooth speaker. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] R1S Launch edition The limited-availability Launch edition included the Adventure package, the large battery, an exclusive Launch green color, and an option to upgrade wheels and tires at no additional cost. [ 34 ] [ 36 ] History [ edit ] Concept Rivian R1S at the Nov 2018 LA Auto Show The Rivian R1S debuted as a prototype model first shown at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November 2018. [ 2 ] The prototype shown in LA was said to be in "production form". [ 14 ] By December 2019, Rivian had raised $1.3 billion in new funding for this and the R1T Truck . [ 37 ] Delivery delays [ edit ] The first two R1S vehicles were delivered to the CEO, R.J. Scaringe, and the CFO, Claire McDonough, in December 2021. [ 38 ] Rivian announced in mid-June 2022 that there would be a delay for some deliveries of its R1S electric SUV. The company cited the delay was due to supply chain issues and limited service infrastructure. [ 39 ] Deliveries to customers began in late August 2022. [ 40 ] The first vehicles to be released were equipped with the large (135 kWh) battery and quad-motor drivetrain. [ 29 ] Price changes [ edit ] In March 2022, Rivian announced the price of the R1S would increase by 20%, jumping to $84,500 from $70,000 for the base model. [ 15 ] [ 41 ] After receiving negative feedback, Rivian honored the original prices for pre-orders made before the price increase. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] In August 2022, Rivian cancelled the base Explore trim level, forcing people who pre-ordered the Explore to either cancel or upgrade to the more expensive Adventure trim.
