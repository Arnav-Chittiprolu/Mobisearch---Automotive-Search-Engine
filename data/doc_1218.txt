Initially a compact SUV built on a body-on-frame chassis, the second-generation Sportage transitioned to a car-based platform which placed it into the compact crossover SUV class, and was originally developed alongside the Hyundai Tucson and since the fifth-generation model launched in 2021, in two sizes with different wheelbase lengths for different markets, alongside the Hyundai Santa Fe and the Kia Sorento . The Sportage has been the best-selling Kia model globally since 2016 after surpassing the Rio . In 2018, the model reached the 5 million production milestone. [ 1 ] As of 2023 [update] , the Sportage is positioned between the Seltos or Niro and the three-row Sorento in Kia's SUV global lineup with the latter sharing platform with the Sportage.

It shares many mechanical components such as the engine, transmissions (early versions), and differentials with the Mazda line of vehicles. This was during Kia's alliance with Ford and Mazda, which involved Ford/Mazda providing technology and Kia providing inexpensive manufacturing facilities for Ford Company. From 1995 to 1998, the Sportage was built by Karmann in Germany; European buyers received German-built versions in that period, while the rest of the world received South Korean-built versions. It was launched in Asia in July 1993 and European sales started two years later. The Sportage was sold in either a five-door SUV or a three-door soft-top convertible . Kia initially developed the wagon in standard length form, but in circa 1996, the company released an extended length version. This stretched model—mainly sold in Asian markets under the name "Sportage Grand", but also as the "Grand Wagon"—featured a 305 mm (12.0 in) longer body utilizing the same wheelbase, an increase in luggage capacity from 1,570 to 2,220 liters (55.4 to 78.4 cu ft), and the relocation of the spare wheel from the tailgate to underneath the floor. [ 2 ] Kia offered three Mazda-sourced engines in the Sportage, beginning with the 2.0-litre FE DOHC inline-four petrol unit producing 95 kW (128 hp) and the 2.0-litre RF inline-four diesel rated at 61 kW (82 hp). Diesel-engined models were mostly restricted to European markets, as was the more basic single overhead camshaft (SOHC) version of the 2.0-litre FE petrol inline-four. Delivering 87 kW (117 hp), this petrol engine was available from 2000 onwards. In North America, the 2.0-litre FE DOHC engine produced 130 hp (97 kW) and had optional four-wheel drive . The 1997 model year Kia Sportage was the world's first production vehicle to be equipped with a knee airbag . [ 3 ] This first-generation model (1993–2002) sold in low numbers, even domestically in South Korea, and models after Hyundai 's 1998 partial takeover of Kia (1997–2002) were recalled twice for rear wheels dismounting while driving. The first-generation Sportage was discontinued in South Korea in 2002, and in North America after the 2002 model year. By 2003, most international markets had discontinued the Sportage range, although it remained on sale in some developing countries until its second-generation replacement arrived in 2005. The Kia Sportage scored the lowest possible result in the Australian ANCAP crash tests – one star out of five. As well as a failure of the seat belts, the vehicle structure collapsed.

A 2.0 L straight-4 diesel engine was available in the United Kingdom. Fans of the original pre- Hyundai Sportage and critics complained that it was considerably larger than the original Sportage and had none of its off-road capability, the two keys to its success. However, buyers of the second-generation model were likely to favor the available 173 PS (127 kW) V6 , with 241 N⋅m (178 lb⋅ft). Overall fit/finish and quality was noticeably improved over the first-generation model. [ citation needed ] A facelift model of the second generation was introduced in May 2008. From 2006, it was manufactured at the Žilina Plant in Slovakia. A second facelift was introduced in the UK in early 2009, only a few months after its first facelift. The Sportage was named as one of the most reliable vehicles from the 2009 Consumer Reports reliability survey. [ 7 ] and ranked second in the "20 least expensive 2009 vehicles to insure" list by Insure.com.

[ 12 ] Two engines were available, a 2.0-litre Hyundai R diesel engine with 184 hp (137 kW), and a 2.0-litre Theta T-GDi petrol engine. In China, it was released by Dongfeng Yueda Kia in October 2010 and called the Sportage R, and was to be built and marketed alongside the previous generation rather than as a replacement for it. [ 13 ] The Sportage won the 2011 Car of the Year (originally "Auto roku 2011 na Slovensku") in Slovakia and "Truck of the Year" nomination of International Car of the Year . It was top of the JD Power Survey for 2012, the only car in the survey to score five stars across all categories, from mechanical reliability to ownership costs and the dealer experience. In South Africa, it took the 2013 Standard Bank People's Wheels Award for "SUVs and Crossovers – City & Suburban". [ 14 ] [ 15 ] Rear view Interior Facelift [ edit ] The third generation received a facelift for the 2014 model year that included a new grille with a redesigned Kia logo, LED tail lights and redesigned alloy wheels.

[ 17 ] [ 18 ] IIHS [ edit ] The third-generation Sportage received a "Top Safety Pick" rating from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety in the United States. [ 19 ] Earning the award became tougher in 2010 when IIHS added the rollover crash test, which measures roof strength and is twice as stringent as the federal requirement. To pass this test, a vehicle's roof must be able to withstand the force of three times the vehicle's weight (acceptable rating). The federal standard requires a roof to hold 1.5 times the vehicle's weight.

The company said the contrasting sharp edges and smooth surfaces were inspired by modern fighter jets. [ 24 ] There are three petrol engines, as well as one diesel engine in the line-up. The petrol options are a 1.6-litre, 2.0-litre or 2.4-litre, offering 97 kW (132 PS) and 161 N⋅m (119 lb⋅ft), 120 kW (163 PS) and 200 N⋅m (148 lb⋅ft), and 138 kW (188 PS) and 241 N⋅m (178 lb⋅ft) respectively, while the diesel is a 2.0-litre, R-series turbo producing 135 kW (184 PS) and 400 N⋅m (295 lb⋅ft). A 130 kW (177 PS) and 265 N⋅m (195 lb⋅ft) 1.6 T-GDi turbo-petrol with an optional seven-speed dual-clutch automatic is also available. Front- (FWD) and all-wheel drive (AWD) configurations are available. In North America, the fourth generation Sportage was offered with three trim levels (LX, EX, and SX). Much like the previous model, it is available with two inline-four engine choices, a naturally aspirated 2.4-litre and a turbocharged 2.0-litre. The 2.4-litre produces 181 hp (135 kW) and 175 lb⋅ft (237 N⋅m), while the turbocharged engine makes 240 hp (179 kW) and 260 lb⋅ft (353 N⋅m), with small variations in performance dependent on whether FWD or AWD is configured. Both engines are mated to a six-speed automatic transmission . Rear view (UK) Interior Facelift [ edit ] In North America, the facelift model was introduced mid-2019 as an early 2020 model year. The changes included redesigned headlights and bumpers, with the front end taking cues from the recently introduced Stinger . Equipment levels were raised somewhat across the board, while a new, somewhat sporty model called "S" was introduced, priced between the LX and EX models.

The Kia KX5 received a facelift in 2019 conducted by Dongfeng Yueda Kia that would exclusively be sold in China only. Available from March 2019, the front fascia was completely restyled with headlamps integrated with the grille and the rear end of the KX5 was also slightly redesigned for the Chinese market. Despite the exclusively restyled exterior, the wheels of the Chinese version are the same as the ones on the international Kia Sportage facelift.

[ 40 ] The model is equipped with a Terrain Mode that automatically adjusts various settings depending on conditions, including snow, mud, and sand. It also features electric control suspension (ECS) on some models that provides continuous damping control in real-time. Hybrid and plug-in hybrid models will also feature an E-Handling system. lt is also equipped with a more compact shift-by-wire transmission dial for the automatic model. The vehicle has also been equipped with updated safety systems such as autonomous emergency braking (AEB), navigation-augmented adaptive cruise control, lane centering assist and advanced blind-spot collision-avoidance assistance system. [ 41 ] For the long-wheelbase model, Kia claims the fifth-generation Sportage received an increased 80 mm (3.1 in) of legroom and 7 mm (0.3 in) of headroom, with overall dimensions at 1,050 mm (41.3 in) and 1,000 mm (39.4 in) respectively.
