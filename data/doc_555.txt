Its name is derived from the words "speedy" and "tonic". [ 10 ] The Stonic debuted in Frankfurt on 20 June 2017 and in South Korea on 13 July 2017, and was released in the fourth quarter of 2017. [ 10 ] [ 5 ] [ 11 ] It is marketed as the Kia KX1 in China. Overview [ edit ] The Kia Stonic made its debut at the 2017 International Motor Show Germany . It is the smallest in Kia's SUV lineup, below the Niro , Sportage , and Sorento . The Stonic shares its platform and interior with the fourth generation Kia Rio . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The Stonic is offered with a choice of four engines: a turbocharged 1.0-litre three-cylinder engine, a 1.2-litre four-cylinder engine, a 1.4-litre four-cylinder engine, [ 12 ] and a 1.6-litre CRDi four-cylinder diesel engine . [ 13 ] In 2020, the 1.6 diesel got a 48 volt mild hybrid addition, called the 'EcoDynamics+'. [ 14 ] The Stonic was discontinued in South Korea in September 2020 due to sluggish sales. [ 15 ] The facelifted model of the Stonic has been assembled and sold in Pakistan since November 2021. [ 16 ] It is offered it two variants: EX and EX+. Both variants come with the 1.4-litre Kappa II MPI I4 engine and 6-speed automatic transmission. [ 17 ] In 2023, Kia moved production of the Stonic from Gwangmyeong to the Seosan plant operated by Donghee , as the Gwangmyeong plant was being retooled for EV production. [ 3 ] The second facelift was unveiled on 1 September 2025. The exterior features a redesigned front and rear fascia, updated headlights and taillights and new alloys, following the Opposites United design language. The interior features a 12.3 inch touchscreen a new steering wheel.The non-hybrid 74 kW (99 hp) and 172 N⋅m (127 lb⋅ft) of torque, the mild-hybrid produces 85 kW (114 hp). [ 18 ] The 2026 Stonic is to increase the mild-hybrid's power to 88 kW (118 hp) and 172 N⋅m (127 lb⋅ft).

Despite the high resemblance between the KX1 and the Stonic, the KX1 was slightly restyled for the Chinese market, featuring a modified hood, redesigned bumpers, improved DRL, and a circular fuel tank cap. In addition, the KX1 uses a completely different dashboard design. Compared to the international model, the Chinese-made version is marginally shorter, with a full body length of 4,100 mm instead of 4,140 mm, and round fog lamps instead of boomerang-shaped LED lights. [ 20 ] It lacks AEB, blind zone monitoring and cruise control compared to the Korean-made version. [ 21 ] The KX1 is powered by a single 1.4-litre petrol engine producing 100 hp (75 kW). The transmission is either 6-speed manual transmission, or a six-speed automatic transmission. Additionally, the top of the trim KX1 receives advanced multimedia, climate control, video surveillance cameras and a sports aerodynamic body kit. [ 22 ] The Chinese-made KX1 has been exported to the Philippines under the Stonic nameplate in October 2020. [ 23 ] In July 2021, Kia Philippines gifted female weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz a Stonic as a reward for winning the gold medal at the 2020 Summer Olympics . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The Stonic was replaced by the Kia Sonet in June 2024.
