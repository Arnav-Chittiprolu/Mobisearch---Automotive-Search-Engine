It is a 50/50 joint venture between local Changan Automobile and US-based Ford Motor Company . The company's principal activity is the manufacture of Ford brand passenger cars for the Chinese market. The company was formed in December 2012 after the decision to restructure Changan Ford Mazda , whereby Ford and Mazda agreed to work with Changan as separate joint ventures. [ 2 ] Currently, Changan Ford's entire production base is the largest manufacturing location outside Detroit, Michigan, for Ford. [ 3 ] It has plants in Chongqing, Hangzhou & Harbin. History [ edit ] In late 2012, China approved division of the Changan Ford Mazda joint venture 50-50 into separate Ford and Mazda components. [ 4 ] In 2013, Changan Ford opened a new engine plant in Chongqing with an investment of US$500 million. [ 5 ] Changan-Ford revealed the Jiayue sub-brand in May 2014. On 18 June 2014, Changan Ford opened its transmission plant in Chongqing with an investment of US$350 million. This is the first transmission plant for Ford in the Asia-Pacific region. [ 6 ] During this period, the company nearly doubled market share to 4.5 percent within two years. [ 7 ] In 2015, Changan Ford acquired Harbin Hafei Automobile Group Co , a subsidiary of Chongqing Changan's parent company, for  vehicle production started in the second half of 2016. The 2015 acquisition of the automobile facility had expanded Changan Ford's production in China by 200,000 vehicles every year. [ 8 ] Production of Jiayue should have started in 2016, but never did. The last Focus Classic was assembled in September of that year. [ 9 ] In 2019, the company was fined by the Chinese government for anti-trust practices. [ 10 ] It was ordered to pay  $23.5 million as penalty for having restricted prices since 2013. [ 10 ] The amount constituted four percent of the company's annual sales in Chongqing.
