Overview [ edit ] Cadillac Cien (3/4 rear view) The Cadillac Cien has a longitudinally mounted 60-degree, 7.5-liter V12 that produced 750 hp (559 kW) and 650 lb⋅ft (881 N⋅m) of torque. The experimental engine featured direct injection and displacement on demand , which allowed the engine to run on only eight or fewer cylinders under light load. The Cien was designed at General Motors' Advanced Design Studio in England and built as a fully working road-going vehicle with the help of the UK-based engineering and motorsport company Prodrive. The Cien's monocoque chassis and body were made of aerogel composite and equipped with active aero. [ 3 ] Its design was inspired by the F-22 Raptor . [ 4 ] Initially, there were plans to put it into production, but due to the lack of development funds and the high expected selling price of US$200,000, the existence of a customer base for the Cien was put into question. The production of the Cien was thus cancelled at a board meeting. [ 5 ] In media [ edit ] The Cadillac Cien was featured in the 2005 film The Island . The Cadillac Cien is a playable vehicle in video games including Gran Turismo , Midnight Club 3: DUB Edition Remix , and Asphalt Legends Unite .
