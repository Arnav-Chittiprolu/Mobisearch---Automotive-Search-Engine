Overview [ edit ] The E50 was originally unveiled as the E1 concept car at the 2012 Beijing International Automotive Exhibition . [ 1 ] In November 2012, SAIC Motor introduced the production version of the Roewe E50, a four-seater supermini sized hatchback for the market in China. Roewe E50 (rear) The E50 has a 47 kW motor and an 18 kWh battery pack supplied by A123 Systems that delivers a range of 180 km (110 mi) and a top speed of up to 120 km/h (75 mph). The E50 uses several lightweight materials from Evonik to reduce energy consumption and to achieve lower emissions. In 2012, the electric car pricing started at CN¥234,900 ( US$37,589 ) before available government incentives , and SAIC's goal was to sell 1,000 units within the first year in the market. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Retail deliveries began in Shanghai in January 2013. [ citation needed ] The E50 is subject to a cash rebate of CN¥60,000 ( US$9,648 ) from the central government , another CN¥40,000 ( US$6,432 ) from the Shanghai municipal government , and also is exempted from the city's license plate fee , which by January 2013 had a cost of CN¥75,000 ( US$12,060 ), but the new energy car plates, or EV plates, are non transferable.

The Dynamo uses a 71bhp electric motor developing 155Nm of torque, and has a range of 50 miles on a single charge.
