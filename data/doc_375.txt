From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Compact executive car Motor vehicle Lexus IS 2021 Lexus IS 300 F Sport (ASE30, Canada) Overview Manufacturer Toyota Also called Toyota Altezza (Japan, 1998–2005) Production October 1998 – present Model years 1999–present Body and chassis Class Compact executive car ( D ) Layout Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive Front-engine, all-wheel-drive Chronology Predecessor Lexus GS 460/F (for IS 500 F Sport Performance) The Lexus IS ( Japanese : レクサス・IS , Hepburn : Rekusasu IS ) is a compact executive car [ 1 ] ( D-segment in Europe) sold by Lexus , a luxury division of Toyota , since 1998. The IS was originally sold under the Toyota Altezza ( Japanese : トヨタ・アルテッツァ , Hepburn : Toyota Arutettsua ) nameplate in Japan from 1998 until 2005 (the word Altezza is Italian for 'height' or 'highness'). The IS was introduced as an entry-level sport model positioned below the ES in the Lexus lineup. It was the smallest car in the Lexus lineup until the introduction of the CT in 2011. The first-generation Altezza (codename XE10) was launched in Japan in October 1998, while the Lexus IS 200 (GXE10) made its debut in Europe in 1999 and in North America as the IS 300 (JCE10) in 2000. The first-generation models were powered by a straight-six engine and available in sedan and wagon variants. The second-generation IS (codename XE20 ) was launched globally in 2005 with V6 -powered IS 250 (GSE20) and IS 350 (GSE21) and Diesel -powered IS 200d/220d (ALE20) sedan models, followed by a high-performance V8 sedan version, the IS F , in 2007, and coupé convertible versions, the IS 250 C and IS 350 C , in 2008. The third-generation Lexus IS premiered in January 2013 and includes the V6-powered IS 250 and IS 350, turbocharged IS 200t/300, hybrid IS 300h and performance-tuned F Sport variants. The IS designation stands for "Intelligent Sport".

The engineering work was led by Nobuaki Katayama from 1994 to 1998 under the 038T program code. Design work which had been done in 1995 by Tomoyasu Nishi was frozen in 1996 and filed under patent number 1030135 on 5 December 1996, at the Japan Patent Office. At its introduction to Japan, it was exclusive to Japanese dealerships called Toyota Netz Store , until Lexus was introduced to Japan in 2006. The Japan-sold AS200 Altezza sedan and AS300 Altezza Gita correspond to the Lexus IS 200 and IS 300 models respectively, as sold in markets outside of Japan. The Lexus IS' primary markets were North America, Australia, and Europe. The Altezza Gita was a hatchback - station wagon version sold in Japan and was known in the US and Europe as the Lexus IS SportCross. The AS300 Altezza Gita was the only Altezza with the 2JZ-GE engine; in export markets this engine was available in the sedan models as well as the Lexus IS300 Sedan. 1998–2000 [ edit ] Introduced in 1998 with the AS200 (chassis code GXE10) and RS200 (chassis code SXE10) sedans, the compact vehicle was produced using a shortened, front-engine, rear-wheel-drive midsize platform, [ 9 ] allowing Japanese buyers to take advantage of tax savings imposed by Japanese government regulations concerning vehicle engine displacement (but not exterior dimensions, as the car was 20 mm wider than the 1,700 mm standard), and adapted parts from the larger second-generation Aristo/GS. [ 9 ] The 2.0-litre 1G-FE straight-six powered AS200 (GXE10, sedan) was equipped with a four-speed automatic as standard. The 2.0-litre 3S-GE straight-four-powered RS200 (SXE10, sedan) was equipped a six-speed manual transmission, while a five-speed automatic was optional. 1999–2005 Lexus IS 200 sedan (GXE10, Australia) The design received critical acclaim at its 1998 launch and was awarded Japan's " Car of the Year " honor for 1998–1999. A few months later, Lexus began marketing the IS 200 equivalent models in Europe. [ 10 ] The IS 200 in Europe was rated at 153 hp (114 kW), with a top speed of 216 km/h (134 mph), and 0 to 100 km/h (0–62 mph) acceleration time of 9.3 seconds. [ 11 ] The styling cues of the rear lamp clusters on the first-generation models were copied by a number of after-market accessory manufacturers for applications on other vehicles. [ 12 ] This iconic style of one or more internal lamp units, covered with a clear (or tinted) perspex cover made popular by Lexus, became known in many circles as 'Lexus-style' or ' Altezza lights '. [ 12 ] The taillight style became so popular, that it influenced the development of clear-covered LED taillamps that only revealed their colour when illuminated. The XE10's chief engineer was Nobuaki Katayama, while the chief test driver and test engineer was Hiromu Naruse. 2000–2003 [ edit ] Toyota Altezza Gita AS300 (JCE10, Japan) In July 2000, a hatchback/station wagon model, the AS300 (chassis code JCE10), was introduced featuring a 3.0-litre 2JZ-GE straight-six engine. Equipped with rear- or all-wheel drive (JCE10, RWD Gita wagon; JCE15, 4WD Gita wagon), the AS300 was only available with an automatic gearbox; a five-speed automatic for the RWD Gita wagon and a four-speed automatic for the 4WD Gita wagon. The six-cylinder version ( 2JZ-GE ) was only available in Japan on the Gita models. Additionally, a six-speed manual transmission was introduced to the AS200 (chassis code GXE10). In the US, the IS 300 sedan debuted in July 2000 as 2001 model and the wagon debuted in 2001 as a 2002 model with the same 3.0-litre six-cylinder engine (the 2.0-litre six-cylinder was not available), while in Europe, the IS 300 joined the IS 200 in the model lineup. The IS 300 models were initially only available with the five-speed automatic transmission in all markets. A five-speed manual – the six-speed manual from the 2-litre model was not designed for the torque put out by the larger 2JZ-GE engine – was made available in the US in 2001 for the 2002 model year. [ 13 ] The manual option was not available on the SportCross wagon. Lexus aimed for 15 percent of American IS 300 sales to be manuals. [ 13 ] Visually, the exterior of the European IS 200 Sport and 300 were almost identical, the only differences being the boot insignia and the larger-engined model initially having clear front indicators (later generalized throughout the range). Interior of Lexus IS 300 The first-generation IS' interior featured unique elements not typically found in other Lexus models. These included a chrome metal ball shifter (USDM & European market, other markets received an optional leather-trimmed shifter), (optional) pop-up navigation screen, and chronograph -style instrument panel (with mini gauges for temperature, fuel economy, and volts). For the European and Australian markets, the IS 300 gained full leather seats rather than the leather/ Ecsaine of the 200, plus auto-dimming rear view and side mirrors, and HID headlamps. In the US, the Environmental Protection Agency listed the IS 300 as a subcompact car ; although it technically had enough overall volume to be called a compact, rear seat room exhibited subcompact dimensions. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test results in 2001 gave the IS 300 the maximum five stars in the Side Driver and Side Rear Passenger categories, and four stars in the Frontal Driver and Frontal Passenger categories. [ 14 ] The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) rated the IS "Good" overall for frontal collisions and "Good" in all six measured front impact categories. [ 15 ] For the first-generation IS in the North American market, sales hit a high of 22,486 units in 2001; subsequent sales years were less than forecast, and below the 10,000-unit mark in 2004. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] The IS 200 fared better relative to sales targets in Europe and Asia, while still well short of the sales volume achieved by the Mercedes-Benz C-Class (?? W203 ??) and other, mostly German-made competitors. This trend was indicative of Lexus' smaller global status; while Lexus' range of cars was very successful in North America, the marque's sales lagged behind its German rivals in Europe. [ 18 ] In Europe, the lack of a manual gearbox option for the IS 300 may have limited sales in contrast to its rivals, the BMW 3 Series ( E46 or E90 ) and the Mercedes C-Class. In 2000, TTE introduced a compressor kit for the IS 200 in the European market. [ 19 ] An Eaton supercharger at 0.3-bar pressure increased the power output to 153 kW (205 hp) without sacrificing fuel consumption (+3.3%). The kit was initially available as an aftermarket fitment, but could also be obtained as OEM Lexus accessory on newer cars through the official Lexus dealer network and was fully covered by the standard warranty. [ 19 ] This variant was discontinued when the IS 300 was introduced in the European market. 2003–2005 [ edit ] 2003 Lexus IS 300 Platinum Edition (JCE10, Australia) 2004 Lexus IS300 SportCross (JCE10, US) In 2003 for the 2004 model year, the IS line received a minor facelift (designed by Hiroyuki Tada). On the exterior, was a redesigned 11-spoke wheel design, redesigned fog lamps, and smoked surrounding trim for the headlamps and taillamps. On the interior, a 2-position memory function was added for the driver seat, a maintenance indicator lamp, automatic drive-away door locking system, a storage compartment on the dash (for models without the navigation system) and updated trim highlights. [ 20 ] An official concept model, the MillenWorks -built Lexus IS 430 was unveiled at the SEMA Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2003. [ 21 ] The IS 430 prototype was an IS 300 fitted with a 4.3-litre V8 from the GS 430 . [ 22 ] Lexus dubbed the IS 430 a one-off with no plans for production. In Europe, Toyota Team Europe (TTE) installed a supercharged 4.3-litre V8 into an IS 300 bodyshell, the result was a 405 PS (298 kW; 399 hp) ECE sedan .

Sales of the sedan began worldwide in September and October 2005 as a 2006 model, with the Toyota Altezza name discontinued due to the introduction of the Lexus marque in Japan, and the slow-selling SportCross station wagon version discontinued from the lineup altogether. Pre-facelift Lexus IS 250 (GSE20, Europe) Interior The second-generation IS marked the next introduction of Lexus' L-finesse design philosophy on a production vehicle, following the premiere of the 2006 GS executive sedan. The sedan's exterior design featured sleeker, coupé -like contours, a fastback profile, and a repeated arrowhead motif in the front fascia and side windows. [ 35 ] The IS sedan has a drag coefficient of C d =0.28. Production of the sedan commenced in September 2005 at the Miyata plant in Miyawaka, Fukuoka , [ 23 ] supplemented in October 2005 with the Tahara plant at Tahara, Aichi . [ 24 ] Production of the IS F started in December 2007 at Tahara. [ 24 ] The facility at Miyata began manufacture of the IS C in April 2009. [ 23 ] IS F [ edit ] Lexus IS F (USE20R) Lexus IS F (USE20R) In North America, IS models sold at launch included the IS 250 and IS 350 sedans; in parts of Europe, the IS models sold by Lexus included the IS 250 and IS 220d sedans. The IS 250 was also available in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Chile (automatic only), South Africa and South Korea. All second-generation IS models offered a more typical Lexus interior compared to the previous generation with a focus on luxurious amenities. The interior is equipped memory leather seats, lightsaber-like electroluminescent instrument display lighting and LED interior lighting accents, the choice of faux-metallic or optional Bird's Eye Maple wood trim (aluminium composite on the IS F), and SmartAccess keyless entry with push-button start. [ 36 ] Options ranged from touchscreen navigation with backup camera to a Mark Levinson premium sound system and Dynamic Radar Cruise Control . On 6 December 2006, Lexus officially confirmed the existence of a high-performance variant of the second-generation IS called the IS F. [ 37 ] The Lexus IS F sedan (USE20) premiered at the 2007 North American International Auto Show on 8 January 2007 as the launch product of Lexus' F marque lineup of performance-focused vehicles. [ 38 ] The IS F went on sale several months later in North America and Europe. The IS F was capable of accelerating from 0–97 km/h (0–60 mph) in 4.2 seconds, [ 39 ] [ 40 ] and had an electronically limited top speed of 274 km/h (170 mph). [ 41 ] The introduction of the second-generation IS model marked a resurgence in sales for the IS line, with a 332% increase overall in 2006 compared to the previous year. In its first year of sales, the IS sold over 49,000 units, making it one of the ten best-selling luxury cars in the US. [ 42 ] The IS line later took a median position in the entry-luxury market; in 2008 it sold behind the variants of the BMW 3 Series , Mercedes-Benz C-Class , and Cadillac CTS , and ahead of the Acura TL , Audi A4 , and Infiniti G sedan. [ 43 ] [ 44 ] Outside the US, the Lexus IS spearheaded Lexus' growing sales efforts in Europe, Australia, and South Africa, becoming the best-selling model in Lexus' lineup in many of the aforementioned markets. In the US, as of 2011, the Lexus IS was the third place best-selling vehicle from the marque after the Lexus RX and Lexus ES. [ 45 ] 2008–2010 [ edit ] In 2008, the IS line received a facelift, and the suspension and steering were retuned for improved stability and control. After three years with only one body style, the IS returned with a second body style, this time as a coupé convertible , on 2 October 2008 when the IS 250 C debuted at the Paris Motor Show . [ 46 ] A more powerful IS 350 C also became available, with engine specifications analogous to those on the sedan models. The IS convertible went on sale in Europe in 2009, in North America in May 2009, [ 46 ] and an IS 300 C was also produced for certain regions. The mid-cycle refresh in 2008 saw slight styling revisions to the interior. First facelift Lexus IS 250 Prestige (GSE20R, Australia) First facelift Lexus IS 250 Prestige (GSE20R, Australia) First facelift Lexus IS 250 C (GSE20R, Australia) 2010–2013 [ edit ] In 2010, coinciding with the second IS line refresh, the revised diesel IS 220d was detuned for improved fuel consumption figures but lowered power output by 27 hp (20 kW; 27 PS). [ 47 ] Building on its " F Sport " line of parts and accessories for the IS 250/350, [ 48 ] [ 49 ] Lexus added factory-produced F Sport IS models in 2010. [ 47 ] This facelift also includes further interior updates for the IS line.

[ 66 ] [ 67 ] [ 68 ] [ 69 ] 2013–2016 [ edit ] 2014 Lexus IS 300h F Sport (AVE30) Interior The production version of the IS was introduced at the North American International Auto Show in January 2013, followed by the 2013 Auto Shanghai. Exterior design work was done by Masanari Sakae [ 70 ] during 2010–2011 and the F Sport models were styled by Yuki Isogai in 2011. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] For the car's third generation, Lexus also hinted at a revival for the IS SportCross station wagon, but that didn't end up happening. [ 73 ] The IS F Sport models include enhanced handling and performance, Adaptive Variable Suspension and Variable Gear Ratio Steering (IS 350). Not only do the F Sport
models handle differently, but they are more aggressively styled to set them apart from the base production models. F-Sport styling includes an edition specific F-Sport pattern front grille, F-Sport logo badges, and five spoke split graphite wheels; the cabin includes carbon fibre-like trim, extra bolstered performance seats, an all-black headliner, and a moving vessel gauge cluster (inspired by the Lexus LFA) that displays navigation and audio information. The F-Sport models have an edition specific Ultra White exterior and Rioja Red interior. The 2014 model year also served as the first year to offer all-wheel drive in the IS F Sport line up. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] [ 76 ] [ 77 ] International models went on sale in mid-2013. Early models included the IS 250 RWD, IS 250 AWD, IS 300h and IS 350 RWD. The hybrid IS 300h model is sold in Europe, Japan, and select international markets. [ 78 ] [ 79 ] [ 80 ] US models went on sale as 2014 model year vehicles on 28 June 2013. [ 81 ] Early models include IS 250 RWD, IS 250 AWD, IS 350 RWD, IS 350 AWD. [ 82 ] [ 83 ] [ 84 ] In 2015, for the 2016 model year, the IS 250 was discontinued and replaced by the rear wheel drive only IS 200t. The IS 300 is only offered with all-wheel drive, while the top-of-the-line IS 350 can be ordered with either drivetrain. [ citation needed ] The IS AWD versions use a full-time all-wheel drive system that utilizes a planetary gearset center differential coupled with a multi-disc clutch to act as the slip limiting device. The planetary gearset provides a 30:70 front-to-rear torque split under normal conditions for handling agility, however the system can allow for a torque split of up to 50:50 to control wheel slip. In August 2017, for the 2018 model year, the IS 300 RWD changed to using the 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine from the previous IS 200t while the IS 300 AWD retained the same 3.5-litre V6 engine. [ citation needed ] Chinese models went on sale in 2013. Early models include the IS 250 and the IS 250 F Sport. [ 76 ] [ 85 ] Japanese models went on sale on 16 May 2013.

[ 92 ] 2017 facelift [ edit ] The revamped third generation model includes updated headlamps, taillamps, front fascia and bonnet. It debuted at the April 2016 Beijing Auto Show with interior technology improvements including 10.3 inch infotainment screen, updated steering wheel, and contrast stitching along the dash. [ 93 ] The Lexus IS receives subtle updates in 2017, for the 2018 model year. Most notably, its V-6 engines get a 5-hp power increase, and the rear-drive, inline-four-powered IS200t is now called the IS300. Joining the options list is adaptive front lighting, which turns the headlights with the steering wheel to improve visibility. The F Sport performance trim now includes a standard limited-slip rear differential, but only in the top-tier rear-drive IS350. [ 94 ] 2019 Lexus IS 300h (AVE30, UK) 2017 Lexus IS 300h (AVE30, Japan) 2020 facelift [ edit ] The IS received a major facelift in 2020 for the 2021 model year. [ 95 ] 2AR-FSE engine in a Lexus IS 300h (AVE30) The updated styling includes a larger bodywork, restyled headlamps and full-width taillamps, slightly updated dashboard, the center console/cupholders and trackpad and armrest from the Lexus RC and a larger spindle grille design. The parking brake pedal was replaced with an auto electric parking brake, and a new switch to control it. The black headliner in the F-Sport models has been changed to a sportier fabric (changed from the soft black headliner of older models). Brake hold feature has been added. An Active Sound Control has been added, which generates sound from behind the instrument panel (the F-Sport models still have the electronically controlled intake valve which can open up to let more real engine sound into the cabin just like the 2014 - 2020 models). The rear boot water channels have plastic guards to divert leaves and twigs away from the taillight panels. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay capabilities were made available, as well as upgraded driver-assistance systems (auto headlights have been upgraded to be simpler to activate and to ignore false positives) and standard blind-spot monitoring with a new adjustable distance function and 3 levels of brightness. The suspension has also been revised with a more rigid body, more rigid C pillars, extra welding on the radiator mount points and front side members, new swing-valve shock absorbers equipped with ultra low-velocity valves, aluminium wishbone front suspension. The transmission tune was also slightly updated, the IS350 (AWD tested, RWD not yet tested) will downshift to 2nd gear up to 90 kmh / 56 mph (up from 84 kmh / 52 mph from the previous 2014 - 2020 models). In the United States, the F Sport trim is only available on the top IS350 model with its 232 kW (311 hp) 3.5-litre V-6. [ 96 ] The Dynamic Handling Package (DHP), which includes Adaptive Variable Suspension, lighter 19-inch black BBS alloy wheels, Sport S and Sport S+ drive select modes, and carbon fibre rear spoiler, is available for the 2021 IS 350 F Sport. Newer IS models (2022 - present) may no longer have the carbon fiber spoiler or side mirror caps, although special blackout packages will add dark chrome window trim and black side mirror caps. [ 97 ] The IS, along with the CT and RC, was discontinued in Europe in 2020 due to poor sales figures, fierce competition from European rivals, and a shift in the market towards crossover SUVs . [ 98 ] [ 99 ] Following the introduction of stricter crash safety regulations, the IS, along with the CT hatchback and the RC coupe, were pulled out from the Australian market in November 2021. [ 100 ] In August 2022, the F Sport Mode Black III Package was released for the Japanese market IS 350, IS 300h, and IS 300. This package includes matte black BBS forged aluminium wheels, black door mirror covers, black stainless steel window molding, triple-eye full LED headlamps, and black Ultrasuede sport seats. [ 101 ] Continuing the F Sport Mode Black line up, the F Sport Mode Black IV Package was launched in January 2025. Available for the Japanese market IS 300 and IS 300h, this limited edition is similar to the previous Mode Black III Package.

This is the first Lexus model classified as " F Sport Performance ", signifying a new class of model that offers the power output and engine of higher "F" marque models, but without the wider body, interior appointments such as sport bucket seats , nor extensively upgraded and tuned brakes, suspension, and chassis. [ 104 ] Distinguishing it from other IS F Sport models, the IS 500 F Sport Performance includes a raised bonnet bulge for the larger V8 engine, stacked quad exhaust tips, Yamaha rear performance dampers, F Sport–tuned Adaptive Variable Suspension, two-piece aluminium 14.0-in front and 12.7-in rear brake rotors, dark chrome window trim, F Sport Performance front door-sill scuff plates, IS 500 startup animation in multi-information display, and F Sport Performance 19-in staggered-width split-10-spoke Enkei alloy wheels, with optional 19-in split-seven-spoke forged alloy Matte Black BBS wheels.
