From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Piston engine with one cylinder DKW RT 250 (1952–1953) motorcycle engine A single-cylinder engine , sometimes called a thumper , is a piston engine with one cylinder . This engine is often used for motorcycles , motor scooters , motorized bicycles , go-karts , all-terrain vehicles , radio-controlled vehicles , power tools and garden machinery (such as chainsaws , lawn mowers , cultivators , and string trimmers ). Single-cylinder engines are made both as 4-strokes and 2-strokes . Characteristics [ edit ] Villiers engine in a 1959 Bond Minicar Compared with multi-cylinder engines, single-cylinder engines are usually simpler and compact. [ 1 ] Due to the greater potential for airflow around all sides of the cylinder, air cooling is often more effective for single cylinder engines than multi-cylinder engines. This reduces the weight and complexity of air-cooled single-cylinder engines, compared with liquid-cooled engines. Drawbacks of single-cylinder engines include a more pulsating power delivery through each cycle and higher levels of vibration. [ 2 ] The uneven power delivery means that often a single-cylinder engine requires a heavier flywheel than a comparable multi-cylinder engine, resulting in relatively slower changes in engine speed. To reduce the vibration level, they often make greater use of balance shafts than multi-cylinder engines, [ 3 ] as well as more extreme methods such as a dummy connecting rod (for example the Ducati Supermono ). [ 4 ] [ 5 ] These balancing devices can reduce the benefits of single-cylinder engines regarding lower weight and complexity. Most single-cylinder engines used in motor vehicles are fueled by petrol (and use a four-stroke cycle ), [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] however diesel single-cylinder engines are also used in stationary applications (such as the Lombardini 3LD and 15LD). A variation known as the split-single makes use of two pistons which share a single combustion chamber. Uses [ edit ] Yamaha SRX600 (1985–1997) motorcycle engine Early motorcycles , automobiles and other applications such as marine engines all tended to be single-cylinder. The configuration is almost exclusively used in portable tools, along with garden machinery such as lawnmowers. [ 9 ] Single-cylinder engines also remain in widespread use in motorcycles, motor scooters , go-karts , auto rickshaws , and radio-controlled models . From 1921 to 1960, the Lanz Bulldog tractor used a large horizontally mounted single-cylinder two-stroke engine. [ 10 ] However, they are rarely used in modern automobiles and tractors, due to developments in engine technology. Single-cylinder engines remain the most common engine layout in motor scooters and low-powered motorcycles . The Honda Super Cub (the motor vehicle with the highest overall sales since its introduction in 1958) uses a 49 cc (3.0 cu in) four-stroke single-cylinder engine. There are also several single-cylinder sportbikes (such as the KTM 690 Duke R ), dual-sport motorcycles (such as the BMW G650GS ) and the classic-styled Royal Enfield 500 Bullet . [ 11 ] [ 12 ] The Moto3 class in the MotoGP World Championship have used four-stroke 250 cc (15.3 cu in) single-cylinder engines since the class replaced 125 cc (7.6 cu in) two-strokes in 2012 . Other single-cylinder engines [ edit ] Engines of other sorts, like the beam engine and certain types of Stirling engine , operate using one cylinder and thus can also be considered single-cylinder engines.
