Named for the city of Lucerne, Switzerland , it served as Buick's top-of-the-line sedan until it was replaced by the second generation Buick LaCrosse . History [ edit ] The Lucerne replaced the full-size LeSabre and the Park Avenue in the Buick range, and used a revised G platform , nonetheless referred to by GM as the H platform. [ 1 ] The Lucerne was introduced with the standard 3.8 liter Buick V6 (also known as the GM 3800 engine ) or optional 4.6 liter Cadillac Northstar LD8 V8 as well as optional active suspension , marketed as Magnetic Ride Control . For 2005, all General Motors vehicles equipped with the 3.8 L V6 become the first SULEV -compliant vehicles. 2011 Buick Lucerne CX 2007 Buick Lucerne rear view The Lucerne featured a row of " Ventiports ," on the front fenders, corresponding to the number of cylinders in each bank of its V-engine — three on each side for the V6 or four for the V8.  The CXL trim package added numerous premium features. The Lucerne was manufactured at GM's Detroit/Hamtramck Assembly Plant alongside the Cadillac DTS .  The plant won Initial Quality Awards from J.D. Power and Associates from 2004 through 2006. GM also led all other automakers in Strategic Vision's Total Quality Index (TQI) [ 2 ] 2008 Buick Lucerne controls closeup The Super trim level was introduced at the 2007 New York Auto Show , featuring the 4.6 liter Northstar L37 V8; revised trim; an increase of 17 hp (13 kW) horsepower, and revised front styling and a rear spoiler. All Lucernes received modest mid-cycle updates in 2008, adding optional blind spot monitoring and lane departure warning system and revised exterior colors.  Two new trim levels, CXL Special Edition (with more standard features than regular CXL) and Super , were added for 2008. [ citation needed ] The 2009 Lucerne received small upgades, including a new base engine, the 3.9 L GM High Value LZ9 V6, Bluetooth phone connectivity, and XM NavTraffic. Flex-fuel technology was made available at no additional cost. [ 3 ] For 2010, the Super's rocker panels, grille, and fog lights were added as standard equipment. The 2011 Lucerne was largely unchanged. The last was built on June 15, 2011. [ 4 ] The second generation LaCrosse replaced it as Buick's flagship sedan for 2012.
