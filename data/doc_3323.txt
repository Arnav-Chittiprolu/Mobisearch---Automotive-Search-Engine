From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Multitronic [ edit ] I don't think Audi's multitronic is significant enough to be listed in the template for transmission types under CVTs, especially when multitronic is not otherwise mentioned in the CVT article. West.Devin 22:48, 2 December 2007 (UTC) [ reply ] Transmission types [ edit ] This template is not about transmission types now, it has tradenames on it, which belongs to some of the main types. I think these should be removed because we cant add all tradenames to it see Category:Automotive technology tradenames . -- Typ932 T · C 14:54, 28 October 2009 (UTC) [ reply ] I fully agree. Tradenames e.g. DSG should be linked/covered from the main article and should not be listed in the template. -- Biker Biker ( talk ) 15:08, 28 October 2009 (UTC) [ reply ] Manual/Automatic [ edit ] Sections should be divided not by use but by construction. Robotised manual transmission is an automated but manual transmission and is built like a manual with clutch and two shafts. Automatic gearbox has a torque converter and multi-clutches between gears. Dual-clutch gearbox is also an automated manual. It is like two manual gearboxes in one shell. Automation in them is by hydraulics.
