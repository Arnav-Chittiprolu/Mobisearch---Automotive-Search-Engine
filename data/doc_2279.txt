The Plug-in Car Grant '''(PiCG)''' started on 1 January 2011 and is available across the UK. The program reduces the up-front cost of eligible cars by providing a 25% grant towards the cost of new plug-in cars capped at {{GBP|5,000}} ({{USD|7450}}).<ref name=GCC0210/><ref name=DfT>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-car-grant/plug-in-car-grant-vehicles |title=Plug-in car grant eligibility guidance |publisher=[[Department for Transport]] |date=February 2015 |access-date=2015-02-16 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216174641/https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/plug-in-car-grant/plug-in-car-grant-vehicles |archive-date=2015-02-16 }}</ref> From 1 April 2015, the purchase price cap was raised to cover up to 35% discount of the vehicle's recommended retail price, up to the already existing {{GBP|5,000}} limit.

The government announced in April 2014 that funding for the full grant of up to {{GBP|5000}} will remain in place until either 50,000 grants have been issued or 2017, whichever is first.<ref name=Grant2015/><ref name=UKGrant25K/> As forecasts estimated that the scheme will reach its 50,000 limit around November 2015, the government announced in August 2015 that the Plug-in Car Grant will continue until at least February 2016 for all plug-in cars with {{CO2}} emissions of 75 g/km of under.<ref name=GrantExtended>{{cite web|url=http://www.nextgreencar.com/news/7192/plugin-car-grant-scheme-extended/|title=Plug-in Car Grant scheme extended|first=Chris |last=Lilly|publisher=Next Green Car|location=UK |date=2015-08-26|access-date=2015-10-17}}</ref> The Government also announced that a minimum of {{GBP|200 million}} ({{USD|311 million}}) has been made available to continue the Plug-in Car Grant.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2015/08/20150826-uk.html|title=UK extends current levels of the Plug-in Car Grant to at least February 2016 |publisher=Green Car Congress |first=Mike |last=Millikin|date=2015-08-26|access-date=2015-10-17}}</ref>

Vehicles eligible for the subsidy must meet the following criteria:<ref name=GCC0210/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://assets.dft.gov.uk/eligibility-criteria-summary.pdf |title=Summary of the Plug-in Car Grant Eligibility Criteria |publisher=[[Department for Transport]] |access-date=2011-07-21 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328012159/http://assets.dft.gov.uk/eligibility-criteria-summary.pdf |archive-date=2012-03-28 }}</ref>
* Vehicle type: Only [[Ultra-low emission vehicle|ultra-low emission cars]] are eligible ([[Directive 2001/116/EC#Vehicle categories|vehicle category M1]]). Motorbikes, quadricycles and vans are not covered.
* [[Carbon dioxide emission|Carbon dioxide exhaust emissions]]: Vehicles must emit equal or less than 75 [[g/km|grams of carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) per kilometre]] driven.
* Range: [[Electric vehicle]]s (EVs) must be able to travel a minimum of {{Convert|70|mi}} between charges. [[Plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]]s (PHEVs) must have a minimum [[all-electric range]] of {{Convert|10|mi}}.
* Minimum top speed: Vehicles must be able to reach a speed of {{Convert|60|mph}} or more.
* Warranty: Vehicles must have a 3-year or {{Convert|60,000|mi}} vehicle warranty (guarantee) and a 3-year battery and electric drive train warranty, with the option of extending the battery warranty for an extra 2 years('drive train' means the parts that send power from the engine to the wheels. These include the clutch, transmission (gear box), drive shafts, U-joints and differential).
* Battery performance: Vehicles must have either a minimum 5-year warranty on the battery and electric drive train as standard, or extra evidence of battery performance to show reasonable performance after 3 years of use
* Electrical safety: Vehicles must comply with certain regulations (UN-ECE Reg 100.01) that show that they are electrically safe.
* Crash safety: To make sure cars will be safe in a crash, they must either have: EC whole vehicle type approval (EC WVTA, not small series) or evidence that the car has appropriate levels of safety as judged by international standards.

In February 2015 the government announced that to take account of rapidly developing technology, and the growing range of ULEVs on the British market, the criteria for the plug-in car grant was updated and from April 2015, eligible ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs) must meet criteria in one of the following categories depending on emission levels and zero-emission-capable mileage, with a technology neutral approach, which means that [[fuel cell vehicle|hydrogen fuel cell cars]] are also eligible for the grant:<ref name=DfT/><ref name=Grant2015/>
* Category 1: {{CO2}} emissions of less than 50g/km and a zero emission range of at least {{Convert|70|mi|abbr=on}}.
* Category 2: {{CO2}} emissions of less than 50g/km and a zero emission range between {{Convert|10|and|69|mi|abbr=on}}.
* Category 3: {{CO2}} emissions of 50–75g/km and a zero emission range of at least {{Convert|20|mi|abbr=on}}.

In December 2015, the [[Department for Transport]] (DfT) announced that Plug-in car grant was extended until March 2018 to encourage more than 100,000 UK motorists to buy cleaner vehicles. A total funding of {{GBP|400 million}} (~{{USD|600 million}}) is available for the extension. To reflect the changes in the British market, the criteria for the Plug-in Car Grant was updated and the maximum grant drops from {{GBP|5,000}} (~{{USD|7,450}}) to {{GBP|4,500}} (~{{USD|6,700}}). For the extension, the amount of the grant is linked in directly with the Office for Low Emission Vehicles three vehicle categories issued in April 2015. The eligible ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs) must meet criteria in one of three categories depending on emission levels ({{CO2}} emissions bands between 50 and 75g/km) and zero-emission-capable mileage (minimum of {{Convert|10|mi|abbr=on}}), with a technology neutral approach, which means that [[fuel cell vehicle|hydrogen fuel cell cars]] are eligible for the grant.<ref name=Grant2015/><ref name=Extension2018>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/17/plug-in-car-grant-extended-to-2018 |title=Plug-in car grant extended to 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=2015-12-17|access-date=2015-12-20}}</ref><ref name=Extension2018_2>{{cite web|url=http://www.nextgreencar.com/news/7409/extension-announced-for-plugin-car-grant/ |title=Extension announced for Plug-in Car Grant|first=Chris |last=Lilly|publisher=Next Green Car|location=UK |date=2015-12-17|access-date=2015-12-20}}</ref> The updated scheme went into force on 1 March 2016.<ref name=Extension2018_2/>

A price cap is in place, with all Category 1 plug-in vehicles eligible for the full grant no matter what their purchase price, while Category 2 and 3 models with a list price of more than {{GBP|60000}} (~{{USD|90000}}) are eligible for the grant. Vehicles with a zero-emission range of at least {{Convert|70|mi|abbr=on}} (category 1), including hydrogen fuel cell vehicles, get a full {{GBP|4,500}} (~{{USD|6,700}}), but plug-in hybrids (categories 2 and 3) costing under {{GBP|60000}} (~{{USD|90000}}) receive {{GBP|2500}} (~{{USD|3725}}).<ref name=Extension2018/><ref name=Extension2018_2/> The grant scheme will come under review when a cumulative total of 40,000 Category 1 claims, and 45,000 Category 2 and 3 combined sales have been made. Both these totals will include cars sold before March 2016.<ref name=Extension2018_2/>

{{As of|2016|10}}, the following 31 cars available in the British market are eligible for the grant according to their category:<ref name=UKGrantEligible>{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/plug-in-car-van-grants/eligibility|title=Plug-in car and van grants – Eligible vehicles by category |publisher=UK Government|date=2016-10-25 | access-date=2016-10-29}}</ref>

In addition to the extension of the Plug-in Grant, the government also announced it will continue the "Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme." Starting in March 2016 owners of ultra-low emission vehicles who install a dedicated charge point at their home, covering roughly half the average cost, will get {{GBP|500}} (~{{USD|750}}) towards the cost of installing the charging point, rather than the previous {{GBP|700}} (~{{USD|1050}}) maximum.<ref name=Extension2018/><ref name=Extension2018_2/> Edit summary (Briefly describe your changes) By publishing changes, you agree to the Terms of Use , and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and the GFDL .
