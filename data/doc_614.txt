Southern Engine built a few automobiles to Collier's design before expanding to a plant in Nashville . The Marathon Motor Works were established from a cotton mill complex. [ 1 ] Southern Engine decided to engineer and build every part of its automobile in-house. The vehicles had been marketed as Southerns at first, but another firm was using that name.  In 1910, Marathon Motor Works was created to produce the Marathon automobile, named out of the enthusiasm for things Greek which had grown out of the 1904 Olympics . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] 1909 saw a two-model lineup, roadster and touring car, powered by 35 HP 4-cylinder engines. Both were open bodies (tops were optional) and sold for about $1,500. By 1912 production reached 200 cars monthly. [ 2 ] Marathons acquired a good reputation for quality and durability due to the factory controlling all parts, engineering and manufacturing.
