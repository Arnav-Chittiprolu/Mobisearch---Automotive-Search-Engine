The agreement also involves the joint cooperation on R&D, manufacture, production and application of intelligent electric vehicle core parts, and the further research on the development of key basic technologies and the innovation of production measures. [ 30 ] In August 2023, FAW-VW , a joint venture between FAW and Volkswagen Group , entered discussions with Leapmotor to explore the potential acquisition of a platform for manufacturing new electric cars under the Jetta brand, specifically tailored for the Chinese market. [ 31 ] In March 2025, FAW Group and Leapmotor signed the MOU on strategic cooperation, under which the two parties will jointly develop passenger vehicles and collaborate on auto parts. [ 32 ] [ 33 ] In April 2025 at the Auto Shanghai , Leapmotor chairman Zhu Jiangming revealed that the two companies have finalized their partnership and will jointly develop a model for the Hongqi brand targeting overseas markets. Mass production of the new vehicle is set to begin in the second half of 2026 at Leapmotor's Hangzhou plant. The new Hongqi model will be built on the same platform as Leapmotor B10 with both battery electric and range-extender powertrain. [ 34 ] In December 2025, Leapmotor announced that FAW Group would acquire 5% of its shares for 3.744 billion yuan. Following this acquisition, the stake held by Zhu Jiangming and other shareholders, who together form the single largest shareholder group, will dilute from 23.75% to 22.56%, while Stellantis' stake will decrease from 19.99% to 18.99%. The investment funds from FAW will be allocated in proportions of 50%, 25%, and 25% for research and development, supplementing working capital and general corporate purposes, and expanding the sales and service network while enhancing brand awareness, respectively. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] [ 37 ] Stellantis [ edit ] In October 2023, Stellantis acquired a 20% stake in Leapmotor for €1.5 billion. [ 38 ] As part of the agreement, Leapmotor International, a joint venture 51% owned by Stellantis and 49% owned by Leapmotor, was established to handle distribution and production of Leapmotor cars outside China, supporting the company's expansion plans, notably in Europe. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] In February 2024, Reuters reported that Stellantis was exploring the possibility of producing a Leapmotor model at its Mirafiori plant in Turin , Italy. [ 41 ] In June, production of the Leapmotor T03 city car began at its plant in Tychy , Poland. [ 42 ] In November, as Poland voted in line with EU tariffs on Chinese-made EVs, production of T03 in the country was already put under question. [ 43 ] It was also reported that Leapmotor International and Stellantis have cancelled the plan of manufacturing the B10 model in Poland and decided to move its production to Slovakia and Germany. [ 44 ] In March 2025, T03 production in Poland ended. [ 43 ] In May 2024, it was announced that Leapmotor International would launch the brand in Europe through Stellantis' dealer network from September 2024, covering Belgium, France, Italy, Germany, Greece, the Netherlands, Romania, Spain, Portugal and other countries. Starting from the fourth quarter of 2024, Leapmotor International will enter India and the Asia-Pacific, the Middle East and Africa (Turkey, Israel, French Overseas Territories) and South America (Brazil, Chile). Six new models will be introduced starting in 2025 with the T03 and C10 launched first. In the next three years, Leapmotor International will launch at least one new model every year. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] In October 2025, it was reported that Stellantis' Opel brand was working on a compact crossover SUV based on the Leapmotor B10 for the European market. Stellantis is reportedly considering producing it in its plant in Zaragoza , Spain. [ 47 ] See also [ edit ] Automotive industry in China New energy vehicles in China Nio Inc.
