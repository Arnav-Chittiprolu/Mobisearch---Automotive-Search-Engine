It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages , or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories (except for eponymous maintenance categories). This is a tracking category . It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme . This category is hidden on its member pages —unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. These categories can be used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse " (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list ( discriminated by classifications ). This category combines all Wikipedia articles needing clarification from July 2025 (2025-07) to enable us to work through the backlog more systematically. It is a member of Category:Wikipedia articles needing clarification . To add an article to this category add {{ Definition needed |date=July 2025}},{{ Definition |date=July 2025}},{{ Confusing |date=July 2025}}, {{ Clarify span |date=July 2025}}, {{ Clarify |date=July 2025}} or  {{ Ambiguous |date=July 2025}} to the article. If you omit the date a bot will add it for you at some point.
