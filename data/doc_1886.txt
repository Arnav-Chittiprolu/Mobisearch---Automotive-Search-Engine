Lying on the southern coast of the Bohai Strait , Yantai borders Qingdao on the southwest and Weihai on the east, with sea access to both the Bohai Sea (via the Laizhou Bay and the Bohai Strait) and the Yellow Sea (from both north and south sides of the Shandong Peninsula).  It is the largest fishing seaport in Shandong.  Its population was 7,102,116 during the 2020 census , of whom 3,184,299 lived in the built-up area made up of the 5 urban districts of Zhifu , Laishan , Fushan , Muping , and Penglai . Names [ edit ] The name Yantai ( lit . " Smoke Watchtower ") derives from the watchtowers constructed on Mount Qi in 1398 by locals. The towers were used to light signal fires and send smoke signals , called langyan from their supposed use of wolf dung for fuel. At the time, the area was troubled by the Japanese pirates, initially raiders from the warring states in Japan but later principally disaffected Chinese. It was also formerly romanized as Yen-tai . [ 2 ] The major district of Yantai is Zhifu , which used to be the largest independent city in the area. It was romanized by the Europeans as Chefoo [ note 1 ] , Che-foo , [ 2 ] Chi-fu , [ 3 ] and Chih-fou . Although this name was used for the city by the Europeans prior to the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War , the locals referred to the settlement as Yantai throughout. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] History [ edit ] Early history [ edit ] During the Xia and Shang dynasties , the region was inhabited by indigenous people vaguely known to the Chinese as the " Eastern Barbarians " ( Dongyi ). Under the Zhou , they were colonized and sinicized as the state of Lai . Lai was annexed by Qi in 567 BC. Under the First Emperor ( Shi Huangdi ), the area was administered as the Qi Commandery . In 218 BCE, during his eastern inspection tour , Emperor Qin Shi Huang visited Zhifu Island, leaving behind the Zhifu Stone Inscription and establishing the Eastern Inspection Palace. The stone inscription later fell into the sea and was lost, though 14 characters survive today through ink rubbings. The Eastern Inspection Palace was demolished in 1966 during Cultural Revolution . Under the Han , this was renamed as the Donglai Commandery ( 東 萊 郡 ). Following the Three Kingdoms period , the area was organized by the Jin as the Donglai Kingdom or Principality , later returning to prefecture status as a jùn and then zhōu . Under the Tang and during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period , it was known as Deng Prefecture and organized with the Henan Circuit . It was then organized as the Laizhou ( 萊 州 府 ) and then, under the Qing , Dengzhou Prefecture ( 登 州 府 ). Up to the 19th century, however, the Zhifu area consisted of nothing but small unwalled fishing villages of little importance. [ 2 ] Under the Ming , these were first troubled by the Wokou and then by the overreacting "Sea Ban" , which required coastal Chinese to give up trading and most fishing and relocate inland upon pain of death. Paleolithic settlement site on Changshan Islands Qin Shi Huang visited Zhifu in 218 BCE Han dynasty lotus lamp Statue of Qi Jiguang in Penglai, who used to serve as the military commander in this region Opening as a port [ edit ] Following the Second Opium War , the Qing Empire was obliged to open more treaty ports by the unequal 1858 Treaty of Tianjin , including Tengchow (now Penglai ). Its port being found inadequate, Zhifu—about 30 miles (48 km) away—was selected to act as the seat of the area's foreign commerce. [ 2 ] The mooring was at considerable distance from shore, necessitating more time and expense in loading and unloading, but the harbor was deep and expansive and business grew rapidly. [ 2 ] The harbor opened in May 1861, with its status as an international port affirmed on 22 August. The official decree was accompanied by the construction of the Donghai Customs House ( 東海 關 ). [ 4 ] It quickly became the residence of a circuit intendant ("taotai"), customs house , and a considerable foreign settlement located between the old native town and the harbor. [ 2 ] Britain and sixteen other nations established consulates in the town. [ 4 ] The town was initially expanded with well-laid streets and well-built stone houses, even for the poorer classes, a Catholic and a Protestant church were erected, and a large hotel did business with foreigners who employed the town as a summer resort. [ 2 ] The principal traders were the British and Americans, followed by the Germans and Thais . [ note 2 ] In the 1870s, the principal imports were woolen and cotton goods, iron , and opium and the principal exports were tofu , soybean oil , peas , coarse vermicelli , vegetables , and dried fruit from Zhifu itself, raw silk and straw braid from Laizhou , and walnuts from Qingzhou . The town also traded Chinese liquors and sundries for the edible seaweed grown in the shallows of the Russian settlements around Port Arthur (now Dalian 's Lüshunkou District ). [ 2 ] In 1875, the murder of the British diplomat Augustus Margary in Tengchong , Yunnan , led to a diplomatic crisis that was resolved in Zhifu by Thomas Wade and Li Hongzhang the next year. [ 5 ] The resultant Chefoo Convention gave British subjects extraterritoriality throughout China and exempted the foreign merchants' enclaves from the likin tax on internal commerce. Its healthy situation and good anchorage made it a favorite coaling station for foreign fleets, giving it some importance in the conflicts over Korea, Port Arthur, and Weihaiwei. [ 5 ] Award-winning Chefoo bobbin lace was produced following the introduction of the craft by British missionaries, [ 6 ] reportedly becoming a popular export. [ 7 ] Chefoo lace was exhibited at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. [ 8 ] Yantai received German economic activities and investments for about 20 years. [ 9 ] In the run-up to the First World War , its trade continued to grow [ note 3 ] but was limited by the poor roads of the area's hinterland and the necessity of using pack animals for portage. [ 5 ] The trade items remained largely the same as before. [ 5 ] After the Germans were defeated by Allied forces in World War I, Qingdao and Yantai were occupied by the Japanese, who turned Yantai into a summer station for their Asian fleet. They also set up a trading establishment in the town. [ 10 ] The different foreign influences that shaped this city are explored at the Yantai Museum, which used to be a guild hall. However, the city's colourful history has not left a distinctive architectural mark, there has never been a foreign concession, and though there are a few grand 19th-century European buildings, most of the town is of much more recent origin. [ 11 ] After 1949, the town's name was changed from Chefoo to Yantai, and it was opened to the world as an ice-free trade port in 1984.

The next day, it established the Shandong Military Government ( 山東軍政府 ) and, the day after that, renamed itself the Yantai Division of the Shandong Military Government ( 山東煙台軍政分府 ). In 1914, Jiaodong Circuit ( 膠東道 ) was established with Yantai as the capital. Jiaodong Circuit was renamed Donghai Circuit ( 東海道 ) in 1925. In 1935, the Xu Minge (徐明娥) Incident sparked large-scale student demonstrations in Yantai, and on November 29 of the same year, the Jiaodong CCP Special Committee launched the November 4th Uprising, which was subsequently suppressed. On February 3, 1938, Yantai was occupied by the Japanese army, marking the city’s first official designation as an urban administrative unit. On 19 January 1938, Yantai participated as part of an anti-Japanese revolutionary committee. After Japan’s surrender, the Eighth Route Army took control of Yantai on August 24, 1945, and the Jiaodong Administrative District was established. That same autumn, the Nationalist Government created the provincially administered City of Yantai and appointed Bai Shupu as acting mayor, while in February of the following year, the Communist authorities formed a separate Yantai municipal unit using parts of Fushan and Muping counties. Beginning in September 1947, a series of military engagements between Nationalist and Communist forces erupted across the Jiaodong Peninsula —known historically as the Jiaodong Campaign—and on October 1, the National Revolutionary Army occupied Yantai, with Ding Futing assuming office as mayor. Ultimately, on October 15, 1948, the People's Liberation Army retook Yantai, returning it to the jurisdiction of the Jiaodong Administrative District.

Wendeng was merged into Laiyang six years later, and this larger Laiyang Special Region was combined with Yantai City to become Yantai Prefecture ( 烟台地区 ). Yantai is of strategic importance to China's defense, as it and Dalian , directly across the Bohai Sea from it, are primary coastal guard points for Beijing . In November 1983, the prefecture became a prefecture-level city . [ 13 ] Geography [ edit ] Yantai is located along the north coast of the Shandong Peninsula , south of the junction of Bohai Sea and Yellow Sea and parallel to the southern coast of Liaoning . The topographical breakdown consists of: 36.62% mountainous 39.7% hilly 50.23% plain 2.90% basin About 2,643.60 km 2 (1,020.70 sq mi) is urbanized. Only Qixia City is located entirely inland. All other county-level entities are coastal, with Changdao consisting entirely of islands. The total coastline of the prefecture is 909 kilometers (565 mi). The summits in the hill country vary from 100–300 meters (330–980 ft); the average peak in the mountainous region is 500 meters (1,600 ft), and the highest point of elevation is the summit of Mount Kunyu ( 崑 嵛 山 ) at 922.8 meters (3,028 ft). There are 121 rivers over 5 kilometers (3.1 mi) in length, the largest being: Wulong River ( 五龙河 ) Dagu River ( 大沽河 ) Dagujia River ( 大沽夹河 ) Wang River ( 王河 ) Jie River ( 界河 ) Huangshui River ( 黄水河 ) Xin'an River ( 辛安河 ) The core of the old town of Zhifu was located above the mouth of the Yi ( 沂 河 , Yí Hé ).

However, the region's largest industry is agriculture. It is famous throughout China for a particular variety of apple and Laiyang pear, and is home to the country's largest and oldest grape winery, Changyu . [ 19 ] Yantai has one of the most dynamic and diversified economies in Shandong Province. Historically known for commercial fishing, fruit production (especially apples), and light manufacturing, the city has evolved into a modern industrial base with strengths in equipment manufacturing, petrochemicals, automobile production, electronics, pharmaceuticals, and emerging high-tech industries. The county-level city of Longkou is well known throughout China for its production of cellophane noodles [ 20 ] . Power [ edit ] Haiyang Nuclear Power Plant Yantai derives most of its energy from a large coal power plant using bituminous coal , and fitted with coal gasification technology to minimize pollution. [ 21 ] The plant is located close to Yantai port. [ 22 ] An attempt to switch northern China from coal to natural gas resulted in shortages, and in 2017 the Chinese government implemented a new plan to convert half of northern China to clean energy for winter heating. [ 23 ] Haiyang , a city under Yantai's prefecture , is anticipated to meet its total winter heating needs with nuclear power by 2021. [ 24 ] Yuhuangding Hospital, the best hospital in the city Industrial zones [ edit ] Yantai Economic and Technological Development Area Yantai Economic and Technological Development Area is one of the earliest approved state-level economic development zones in China. It now has a planned area of 10 km 2 (3.9 sq mi) and a population of 115,000. It lies on the tip of the Shandong Peninsula facing the Yellow Sea. It adjoins downtown Yantai, merely 6 kilometers away from Yantai Port and 6 kilometers away from Yantai Railway Station (not to be confused with Yantai South Railway Station). [ 25 ] Yantai Export Processing Zone Yantai Export Processing Zone (YTEPZ) is one of the first 15 export processing zones approved by the State Council. The total construction area of YTEPZ is 4.17 km 2 (1.61 sq mi), in which the initial zone covers 3 km 2 (1.2 sq mi). After developing for several years, YTEPZ is completely constructed. At present, the infrastructure has been completed, with standard workshops of 120,000 m 2 (1,300,000 sq ft) and bonded warehouses of 40,000 m 2 (430,000 sq ft). Up to now, owing to an excellent investment environment, YTEPZ has attracted investors from foreign countries and regions such as Japan, Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Sweden, the United States, Canada, etc., as well as domestic investors, to operate in the zone. [ 26 ] Education [ edit ] Yantai No.1 High School The following is a list of prominent Yantai higher education institutions. Yantai University Ludong University Shandong Institute of Business and Technology China Agricultural University and Binzhou Medical College house campuses in Yantai. Yantai also houses a Korean international school, Korean School in Yantai . From 1881 to 1951, Chefoo School was operated, it was a missionary school established to educate foreign children. Transport [ edit ] Yantai Penglai International Airport provides scheduled flights to major airports in China as well as Seoul, Osaka, and Hong Kong. [ 27 ] The Lancun–Yantai railway ends at Yantai. [ 28 ] The Qingrong Intercity Railway, the first intercity high-speed railway in Shandong Province, has been put into operation, cutting the travel time of the fastest train from Qingdao to Yantai from about 4 hours and 30 minutes to about 1 hour and 15 minutes. Tourism [ edit ] Ship Mast on Yantai Hill Temple of the Sea Goddess Penglai City's Dan Cliffs ( 丹崖 ) is said to be the departure point of the Eight Immortals on their trip to the Conference of the Magical Peach. [ citation needed ] It is important to note that Penglai is around 80 km from the city centre of Yantai. Yangma Island [ 29 ] is located in the north of Muping District , Yantai and has a large area. The climate on the island is pleasant, with no severe cold in winter and no scorching heat in summer, making it suitable for leisure and vacation. It can be called the Maldives in China. Yangma Island has a long history. It is said that Emperor Qin Shihuang raised royal horses here during his eastward tour and was named the "Royal Horse Island", hence the name of Yangma Island.
