In the Mercedes-Benz van lineup, the Citan is the smallest model offered, alongside the mid-size Vito (aka Viano, V-Class, and EQV) and large Sprinter .

The van is aimed at both the passenger car and light commercial vehicle markets and is the first Mercedes-Benz to be launched into the commercial vehicle market since the Vito in 1995.

[ citation needed ] Bodystyles [ edit ] rear Mercedes-Benz Citan Traveliner Mercedes-Benz Citan Traveliner (Rear) The Citan is available in three different lengths: compact (3.94m), long (4.32m) and extra-long (4.71m). The vehicle comes in three bodystyles: Panel Van , Dualiner and Traveliner , with the Panel Van seating up to two people and both the Dualiner and Traveliner seating up to five. Safety [ edit ] The Citan Traveliner received four passenger stars in the Euro NCAP safety tests. [ 2 ] The Mercedes-Benz CITAN Kombi was first tested by Euro NCAP in April 2013, and was given a three star rating. Mercedes-Benz indicated at that time that they would improve the safety performance of the vehicle, especially the deployment of the side airbag and the installation of child restraints; and that they would provide a seatbelt reminder for the front passenger seat and make the speed limitation device comply with Euro NCAP's requirements. These changes are now in production and Euro NCAP has reassessed the vehicle. Several tests have been redone to assess the changes that Mercedes-Benz have made. Where the performance is not influenced by the changes, test results have been carried over from the original assessment. [ 3 ] In March 2024, the Citan van was awarded a Platinum rating from Euro NCAP due to its high level of active safety systems. [ 4 ] Euro NCAP Rating Adult occupant: Pedestrian: Marketing [ edit ] In 2012, Mercedes-Benz began a marketing campaign for the Citan with Richard Dean Anderson reprising his role as the popular TV show character MacGyver . The series of short films, titled MacGyver and the New Citan , is available on the official Citan website, from 18 September. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The episodes were shot in Johannesburg, South Africa , in July 2012.
