ICE vehicles typically produce more carbon emissions than EVs.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Kuyumcu |first=Alen Murat |last2=Bingül |first2=Barış |last3=Akar |first3=Fırat |last4=Yıldız |first4=Aleyna |date=2024-08-15 |title=Well-to-wheel carbon footprint and cost analysis of gasoline, diesel, hydrogen ICE, hybrid and fully electric city buses |url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0360544224014580 |journal=Energy |volume=301 |article-number=131685 |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2024.131685 |issn=0360-5442|url-access=subscription }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Saini |first=Harshit |last2=Rama Rao |first2=T. |last3=Saini |first3=Sanjai |last4=Anbazhagan |first4=Geetha |last5=and Sharma |first5=Vijay |date=2023-04-11 |title=Well-to-wheel performance of internal combustion engine vehicles and electric vehicles – study for future Indian market |url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15567036.2023.2182844 |journal=Energy Sources, Part A: Recovery, Utilization, and Environmental Effects |volume=45 |issue=1 |pages=2089–2111 |doi=10.1080/15567036.2023.2182844 |issn=1556-7036|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Some of the environmental impact is shifted to the site of the [[Electricity generation|generation plants]], depending on the method by which the electricity used to recharge the batteries is generated. This shift of environmental impact from the vehicle itself (in the case of internal combustion engine vehicles) to the source of electricity (in the case of electric vehicles) is referred to as [[the long tailpipe]] of electric vehicles. This impact, however, is still less than that of traditional vehicles, as the large size of power plants allow them to pollute less per unit power than internal combustion engines, and electricity generation continues to become greener as renewables such as wind, solar and nuclear power become more widespread.<ref name=":3">{{Cite journal |last1=Pan |first1=Shuai |last2=Yu |first2=Wendi |last3=Fulton |first3=Lewis M. |last4=Jung |first4=Jia |last5=Choi |first5=Yunsoo |last6=Gao |first6=H.

The specific [[emission intensity]] of [[Electricity generation|generating electric power]] varies significantly with respect to location and time, depending on current demand and availability of renewable sources (See [[List of renewable energy topics by country and territory]]). The phase-out of [[Fossil fuel phase-out|fossil fuels]] and [[Coal phase-out|coal]] and [[Renewable energy transition|transition to renewable and low-carbon power]] sources will make electricity generation greener, which will reduce the impact of electric vehicles that use that electricity.

Most of the lithium-ion battery production occurs in [[China]], where the bulk of energy used is supplied by [[Coal power in China|coal burning power plants]]. A study of hundreds of cars on sale in 2021 concluded that the life cycle GHG emissions of full electric cars are slightly less than hybrids and that both are less than gasoline and diesel fuelled cars.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Buberger |first1=Johannes |last2=Kersten |first2=Anton |last3=Kuder |first3=Manuel |last4=Eckerle |first4=Richard |last5=Weyh |first5=Thomas |last6=Thiringer |first6=Torbjörn |date=2022-05-01 |title=Total CO2-equivalent life-cycle emissions from commercially available passenger cars |journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |language=en |volume=159 |article-number=112158 |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2022.112158 |s2cid=246758071 |issn=1364-0321|doi-access=free }}</ref>

=== Air pollution ===
{{See also|Mobile source air pollution}}

Compared to conventional internal combustion engine automobiles, electric cars reduce local [[air pollution]], especially in cities,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Zeroing in on Healthy Air report |url=https://www.lung.org/clean-air/electric-vehicle-report |access-date=2022-04-06 |website=www.lung.org |language=en}}</ref> as they do not emit harmful [[Motor vehicle emissions|tailpipe pollutants]] such as [[particulate]]s ([[soot]]), [[volatile organic compound]]s, [[hydrocarbon]]s, [[carbon monoxide]], [[ozone]], [[lead]], and various [[NOx|oxides of nitrogen]].

The operation of any car results in [[non-exhaust emissions]] such as brake dust, airborne road dust, and tire erosion, which contribute to particulate matter in the air.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=This is why electric cars won't stop air pollution|url=https://www.imeche.org/news/news-article/this-is-why-electric-cars-won%27t-stop-air-pollution|access-date=2020-10-12|website=www.imeche.org}}</ref> Particulate matter is dangerous for respiratory health.<ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Habre |first1=Rima |last2=Girguis |first2=Mariam |last3=Urman |first3=Robert |last4=Fruin |first4=Scott |last5=Lurmann |first5=Fred |last6=Shafer |first6=Martin |last7=Gorski |first7=Patrick |last8=Franklin |first8=Meredith |last9=McConnell |first9=Rob |last10=Avol |first10=Ed |last11=Gilliland |first11=Frank |date=February 2021 |title=Contribution of tailpipe and non-tailpipe traffic sources to quasi-ultrafine, fine and coarse particulate matter in southern California |journal=Journal of the Air & Waste Management Association (1995) |volume=71 |issue=2 |pages=209–230 |doi=10.1080/10962247.2020.1826366 |issn=2162-2906 |pmc=8112073 |pmid=32990509|bibcode=2021JAWMA..71..209H }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Non-exhaust Particulate Emissions from Road Transport: An Ignored Environmental Policy Challenge |url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/sites/4a4dc6ca-en/index.html?itemId=/content/publication/4a4dc6ca-en |access-date=2022-04-06 |website=www.oecd-ilibrary.org |language=en}}</ref> In the UK non-tailpipe particulate emissions from all types of vehicles (including electric vehicles) may be responsible for between 7,000 and 8,000 premature deaths a year.<ref name=":0" /> Due to [[regenerative braking]] EVs produce less brake dust, but have more tire erosion due to their higher weight.

=== Lower operational impacts and maintenance needs ===
[[Battery electric vehicle]]s have lower maintenance costs compared to internal combustion vehicles since electronic systems break down much less often than the mechanical systems in conventional vehicles, and the fewer mechanical systems onboard last longer due to the better use of the electric engine. Electric cars do not require oil changes and other routine maintenance checks.<ref name="PEVs2">{{cite book |author=Saurin D.

[[Internal combustion engine]]s are relatively inefficient at converting on-board fuel energy to propulsion as most of the energy is wasted as heat, and the rest while the engine is idling. [[Electric motor]]s, on the other hand, are more [[thermal efficiency|efficient]] at converting stored energy into driving a vehicle. [[Electric drive vehicle]]s do not consume energy while at rest or coasting, and modern plug-in cars can capture and reuse as much as one fifth of the energy normally lost during braking through regenerative braking.<ref name=PEVs2/><ref name=TwoBillion>{{Cite book |last=[[Daniel Sperling|Sperling, Daniel]] and Deborah Gordon |title=Two billion cars: driving toward sustainability |year=2009 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/twobillioncarsdr00sper_0/page/22 22–26 and 114–139] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]], New York |isbn=978-0-19-537664-7 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/twobillioncarsdr00sper_0/page/22 }}</ref>

=== Water usage ===
Overall whether an electric car uses more water than a fossil-fuelled car mainly depends on how the electricity is generated in the region that the car is used, for example in China in the 2010s an electric car used more.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Wang |first=Li |last2=Shen |first2=Wei |last3=Kim |first3=Hyung Chul |last4=Wallington |first4=Timothy J. |last5=Zhang |first5=Qiang |last6=Han |first6=Weijian |date=2020-03-01 |title=Life cycle water use of gasoline and electric light-duty vehicles in China |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921344919305348 |journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling |volume=154 |article-number=104628 |doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2019.104628 |issn=0921-3449|url-access=subscription }}</ref> Up to 150,000 liters of water are required to put out a single electric car fire.
