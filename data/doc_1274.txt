From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Drivetrain where wheels receive torque from motors independent of each other Concept (top view): In a vehicle, motors M1 through M4 drive respective wheels independently, possibly through respective gear arrangements. Individual-wheel drive ( IWD ) is an automobile design in which the vehicle has an all-wheel drive powertrain that consists of multiple independent traction motors each supplying torque to a single drive wheel . [ 1 ] The term was coined to identify electric vehicles with a four-motor layout , where each wheel is driven by an individual electric motor , [ 2 ] [ 3 ] as opposed to the differential drivetrain seen in conventional four wheel drive (4WD) ICE vehicles and the dual-motor 4WD design seen in many plug-in electric vehicles . Characteristics [ edit ] These vehicles inherently have a range of characteristics built-in that can exceed the level of control commonly attributed to four-wheel drive vehicles or vehicles with extensive control systems. These characteristics may include: Precise individual control of torque to each wheel [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Anti-skid If one motor fails, the other motors are powerful enough to drive the vehicle to the nearest repair shop [ original research? ] Easier replacement of motors No – possibly long and heavy – drive shafts , no central gear box and no mechanical differentials or lockers , reducing vehicle weight, reducing or eliminating transmission losses and simplifying its construction [ 5 ] On-the-spot, zero-radius turning like a tracked vehicle by rotating the drive-wheels in opposite directions [ 6 ] On-the-fly switching between front-wheel , rear-wheel and all-wheel drive configurations The motors that are used in these vehicles are commonly wheel hub motors , since no transmission components are then required. Alternative layouts with inboard motors and drive shafts are also possible. Hydraulic wheel drive [ edit ] Hydraulic wheel drives share many of the same features as an electric wheel drive. They also lack the need for a central gear box, mechanical differentials, drive shafts, and provide on the fly switching between front, rear and all-wheel drive. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Hydraulic individual wheel drives are standard in various machines, such as zero-turn mowers , multi one lifts / front end loaders , and forklifts . Hydraulic drives are primarily found in machines that serve uses which benefit from the ability to "turn on a dime ", i.e. with an exceptionally short turning diameter , and move between forward and reverse modes without shifting gears, such as lawn mowers and loading equipment.
