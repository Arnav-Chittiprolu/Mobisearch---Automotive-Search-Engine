The majority of these vehicles are sold as a pickup truck or cab chassis , although they could be configured in a variety of body styles. The pickup truck was sold with the Hilux name in most markets, but in North America, the Hilux name was retired in 1976 in favor of Truck , Pickup Truck , or Compact Truck . In North America, the popular option package, the SR5 (Sport Runabout 5-Speed), was colloquially used as a model name for the truck, even though the option package was also used on other Toyota models, like the 1972 to 1979 Corolla . In 1984, the Trekker , the wagon version of the Hilux, was renamed the 4Runner in Venezuela, Australia and North America, and the Hilux Surf in Japan. In 1992, Toyota introduced a newer pickup model, the full-size T100 in North America, necessitating distinct names for each vehicle other than Truck and Pickup Truck . Since 1995, the 4Runner is a standalone SUV, while in the same year Toyota introduced the Tacoma to replace the Hilux pickup in North America. Since the seventh-generation model released in 2004, the Hilux shares the same ladder frame chassis platform called the IMV with the Fortuner SUV and the Innova minivan. Cumulative global sales in 2017 reached 17.7 million units. [ 2 ] In 2019, Toyota revealed plans to introduce an electric-powered Hilux within six years.

The vehicle was conceived by Toyota, and was developed and manufactured by Hino Motors at its Hamura Plant . [ 7 ] In Japan, it was available at the Toyota Japan dealership retail chains called Toyota Store and Toyopet Store . The modification to the engine was enough for a claimed top speed of 130 km/h (81 mph). [ 8 ] The 1.5-litre engine was upgraded to a 1.6 L inline-four in February 1971. In April 1969, a long-wheelbase version was added to the range. The short-wheelbase version also continued in production for many more years. [ citation needed ] The long-wheelbase version was not sold in the North American market until 1972, allowing the Datsun Truck to maintain a strong market presence. The Hilux was offered alongside the Toyota Crown , Toyota Corona , and Toyota Corona Mark II based pickup trucks in Japan until 1972, when the Crown, Corona, and Corona Mark II were repositioned as passenger sedans. In spite of the name "Hilux", it was a luxury vehicle only when compared to the Stout . The Hilux was engineered and assembled by Hino Motors to replace the earlier vehicle that the Hilux was derived from, called the Briska [ 9 ] in the niche beneath the larger and older Stout – it replaced the Stout fully in some markets. For the North American market, the only body style was a regular cab short bed and all were rear-wheel drive . It used a typical truck setup of A-arms and coil springs in front and a live axle with leaf springs in back. A four-speed manual transmission was standard. Starting in November 1971, final assembly of trucks for the US market was completed by Atlas Fabricators in Long Beach, California, later renamed Toyota Auto Body California . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] Trucks were shipped from the factory in Japan as a chassis cab (the entire truck, less the truck bed). When the trucks arrived in the United States, a truck bed would be locally built and attached to the chassis before being sent to dealers. The arrangement was a form of tariff engineering , allowing Toyota to circumvent the chicken tax , a 25 percent tariff on imported light trucks . [ 13 ] By only importing a chassis cab, Toyota only had to pay a 4% tariff.

Nicknamed the "RokeHi" (ロケハイ), a portmanteau of "Rocket Hilux", it has a more comfortable interior along with exterior updates. A 2.25 m (7.4 ft) "long bed" was an option for the first time in North American markets, although such a version had been available worldwide since April 1969. [ 6 ] This received the "RN25" chassis code. [ 15 ] The 2.0 litre 18R engine was available in Japan as well, with a three-speed automatic transmission available as an option. The 2.0-litre automatic model managed a "gentle" 136.1 km/h (84.6 mph) top speed in a period road test conducted in South Africa, in spite of a claimed 89 kW (121 PS; 119 hp). [ 16 ] The Hilux was radically redesigned in 1975 to be larger and with increased standard equipment. In North America, the new version also meant the introduction of the larger (2.2 L) 20R engine and the SR5 upscale trim package. A five-speed manual transmission became optional. In North America, the Hilux name was fully phased out in favour of "Truck" by that year, having been dropped from brochures and advertising campaigns, starting in 1973. Some North American motor-coach manufacturers began building Toyota motor-homes from the Hilux. Toyota Hilux (rear view) Wolverine 4x4 [ edit ] Starting in 1975 “Off Road Marketing” in Garden Grove, California in the United States developed a 4 wheel drive system for these trucks and marketed it as the Wolverine 4x4. Toyota never offered a factory four wheel drive system for this generation of Hilux, Off Road Marketing outfitted two wheel drive trucks with all the components necessary for four wheel drive. While they did manufacture many of the components themselves most of the major components such as the front axle, leaf springs, and transfer case were ‘off the shelf’ and found on the Jeep CJ and other four wheel drive vehicles. The front axle is a Dana 30 (the rear axle remains Toyota), the transfer case is a Dana 20, and the leaf springs are made by Cambria Spring Co. [ 17 ] The engine offered is the 2.2L 20R paired to a 5 speed manual transmission. These trucks were available to be purchased at US Toyota dealerships throughout the country between 1975-1979. The Wolverine ceased production when Toyota began offering a factory 4x4 option with in the 3rd generation Hilux.

[ 6 ] The newer model was of similar dimensions to its predecessor, but both front and rear tracks were wider. Another change was the front suspension was changed from coil springs to a torsion bar design, still with a double wishbone layout . [ 22 ] The 4WD variant – not offered with any engines smaller than the two-litre "18R" – featured some common technology with the larger Toyota Land Cruiser . [ 9 ] Its front axle was a live, leaf-sprung design unlike the more car-like type used on rear-wheel drive Hiluxes. Production of the four-wheel drive models stopped in July 1983, but some 2WD variations continued production in parallel with the next generation models. [ 6 ] The L series diesel engine was offered on the 2WD variants from September 1979 and also on the 4WD variants beginning in March 1983. [ 6 ] In Japan, the Hilux was joined with the all new Toyota MasterAce , sharing load carrying duties which was sold at Toyota Store locations alongside the Hilux. The Australian market originally received the 1.6-litre 12R engine in rear-wheel drive models, while 4WD models have the 2-litre 18R-C engine with 63 kW (86 PS). [ 23 ] These were all built on the longer wheelbase, with either pickup or cab-chassis bodywork. Top speed of the Australian Hilux 4WD was 130 km/h (81 mph). [ 24 ] In North American markets, the Hilux (known as the Pickup) saw the use of four-wheel drive. It had a solid front axle and leaf suspension. The body saw a redesign that included single round headlights and a less complex body. This new 4WD setup featured a gear driven RF1A transfer case. This transfer case is unique in that its low-range reduction portion can be replicated, using what some refer to as a dual or triple transfer case. This results in a much lower overall gear ratio. [ 25 ] It was the first Hilux available with an automatic transmission in that market. In 1981, a vehicle development agreement was established between Toyota, Winnebago Industries and two other aftermarket customisers. This was to allow Toyota to enter the SUV market in North America. The vehicles which resulted from this collaboration were the Trekker (Winnebago), Wolverine, and the Trailblazer (Griffith). All three used the Hilux 4×4 RV cab and chassis, and an all- fiberglass rear section (the Trailblazer had a steel bed with a fibreglass top). Research and development work on the Trekker led to the development of the 4Runner / Hilux Surf , which was introduced in 1984. Toward the end of the SR5's production run (1983 1 ⁄ 2 model year), Toyota introduced the luxury Mojave trim for the US market as a limited-production (3,500 units) model with options not available on any other Toyota pickup. [ 26 ] With a list price of US$8,308 (equivalent to $26,229 in 2024), [ 26 ] it had bucket seats, two-speaker multiplex radio, chrome front and rear bumpers, and deleted Toyota logos on either the grille or the tailgate . [ 26 ] Cruise control , power steering, and air conditioning were optional. [ 26 ] It was powered by the SR5's standard 2.4 L (150 cu in) inline-four engine . [ 26 ] In Thailand, this model was sold as the Toyota Hilux Super Star.

These models carried over the carbureted 22R engine while model year 1984 also saw the introduction of the fuel injected 22R-E engine . Two diesel engines were also offered, the 2L and the turbocharged 2L-T. The engines were discontinued in the US after the 1986 model year. This was due to higher performance expectations from customers and the wide availability of inexpensive petrol. [ citation needed ] The next year saw the introduction of a turbocharged option, the 22R-TE , perhaps due to increasing competition from Nissan who already offered a V6 truck at this time. The solid front axle was replaced with an independent front suspension /torsion bar setup in the 4×4 model in 1986, and optional automatic differential disconnect for the front differential (an alternative to automatic locking hubs). 1985 was the last year of the solid front axle in most markets. The solid front axle would remain in the 5th generation 4×4 LN106 model until 1997. Solid front axles had been present in all 4×4 Toyota models until 1986. In late 1986 for the 1987 model year, the truck went through a minor interior and exterior redesign, that included a new grille, a new 1 piece front bumper, an updated interior with full high door panels with faux leather stitching on the base and DLX models, the gauge cluster surround was more rounded and featured faux leather stitching on it, the dash pad featured a shorter tray than earlier models, the steering wheels were changed from black to grey, red, brown, or blue depending on the interior colour, the radio bezel was also colour matched to the rest of the interior, the SR-5 tach gauge clusters had the pattern on the face changed from a grid pattern to horizontal lines, the outside door mirrors were also changed to have a more stream lined appearance, the faceplate for the heater controls was also redesigned. A V6 engine was introduced in 1988. The Hilux-based 4Runner which made its entry in Australia, North America and the United Kingdom was based on this generation of the Hilux; in some other markets, such as Japan, it was called the Hilux Surf . In North America, the automatic shifter on 2WD models was relocated to the column. [ citation needed ] Toyota introduced a new generation of the Hilux in most markets in late 1988 but the fourth generation remained in production until 1997 in South Africa. This was due to South African "content laws" which made it cheaper to continue the production of the fourth generation of the Hilux, rather than to retool the plant for the fifth generation model. [ 29 ] In Thailand, this generation was sold as the Toyota Hilux Hercules/Hero.

Its one-piece cargo-box walls eliminated the rust-prone seams that were found in earlier models. The V6 Xtracab SR5 earned Motor Trend magazine's Truck of the Year award that year. The Xtra Cabs now featured more room behind the front seats than the last generation which allowed optional jump-seats for rear passengers, a feature more in line with competitors of the time. Volkswagen built and marketed the Hilux under the Volkswagen Taro name from February 1989 to March 1997. It was also sold in Thailand as the Toyota Hilux Mighty-X. The Hilux received a minor facelift in 1991 (for the 1992 model year), which was a grille change incorporating the new Toyota emblem that had been recently adopted. In 1991, North American production began at the NUMMI plant in Fremont, California . It was during this generation that Toyota discontinued the Hilux line in North America (where it was marketed as the "Toyota Pickup"), replacing it with the new Tacoma for the 1995 model year.

For these markets the model number for the 4WD double cabin was RN106 -instead of the standard number LN106-. For sales in Argentina , Brazil , and Uruguay , the Hilux was produced in Argentina from 1997 through 2005 (Zárate Plant – both petrol and diesel engines). For sales in Bolivia , Chile , Paraguay and Peru , the Hilux was imported from factories in Japan from 1989 to 1997 (petrol and diesel engines). The available options for these markets were: single cab chassis (2WD, 4WD, petrol engines) (Colombia and Ecuador) single cab long bed (2WD, 4WD, petrol and diesel engines - all South American markets; diesel engine not available in Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela) Xtracab (2WD, 4WD, petrol - only Bolivia) crew cab (2WD, 4WD, petrol and diesel engines - all South American markets; Diesel engine not available in Colombia, Ecuador, and Venezuela) North America [ edit ] In North America, the Hilux continued to be sold simply as the "Toyota Pickup". A wide range of models were available (excluding the Crew Cab model available internationally), mixing four- and six-cylinder engines, long and short beds, regular and Xtracabs, manual and automatic transmissions, and two- or four-wheel drive. [ 34 ] The cargo capacity was typically 1,640 lb (744 kg) for two-wheel drives and 1,400 lb (635 kg) for four-wheel drive models. GVWRs ranged from 2,565 to 5,350 lb (1,163 to 2,427 kg). [ 34 ] Initially only imported from Japan, NUMMI -built trucks began appearing in 1990, [ 35 ] however some trucks sold in the United States during the 1991 through 1995 model years were still manufactured in Japan as not all versions were built in California. The VIN on NUMMI-made trucks began with '4T' while Japanese-made ones started with 'JT'. While the fifth generation Hilux continued to be sold elsewhere in the world until 1997, in North America it was replaced by the new Tacoma after an abbreviated 1995 model year.

For sales in Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, it was imported from Japan from 1998 through 2004 (petrol engined 2.7 L, and diesel engined 2.8 L). This model was not sold in Argentina or Brazil because the fifth-generation Hilux had received a redesign and upgrade.

( March 2020 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Toyota introduced a mid-size SUV variant of the Hilux in 1998. Called the Sport Rider, this variant was sold only in Thailand, where it was also built. In style and execution, the Sport Rider is similar to the Toyota 4Runner . The Sport Rider frame and suspension system are derived from the Hilux, including the Hilux's independent front suspension and leaf-sprung rear suspension. The vehicles began as four-door pickup trucks and were then modified into wagons on arrival in Thailand by Thai Auto Works Co (a majority Thai-owned company in which Toyota has a 20 percent stake). Engine options for the Sport Rider included the 5L engine for the PreRunner (2WD), while the 5L or 5L-E engines were available for the 4WD model. Toyota introduced the first facelift in 2001, upgrading to the 1KZ-TE engine and with foglamps integrated with the front bumper. Toyota introduced a second facelift in 2002 with the 1KD-FTV engine for 4WD and the 2KD-FTV engine for the PreRunner (2WD) and 4WD models, a new front bumper, new projector-style headlights, and new rear lamps. Toyota discontinued the Sport Rider in 2004 and replaced it with the Toyota Fortuner in 2005.

[ 42 ] Three pickup truck body variants were initially produced: a two-door Single Cab (referred to by Toyota as IMV1), a two-door Xtra Cab (IMV2), and four-door Double Cab (IMV3). [ 52 ] In September 2008, Toyota introduced the Smart Cab, a four-door cab with hidden rear clamshell doors . [ 53 ] The IMV program also spawned the Toyota Innova (AN40) minivan (IMV4) and Toyota Fortuner (AN50/AN60) SUV (IMV5). [ 42 ] [ 54 ] Mainly developed in Thailand, this seventh-generation Hilux was the first to not be produced in Japan. [ 7 ] Hilux models sold in Asian, European, Middle Eastern and Oceanian markets were initially built and assembled in Thailand with targeted annual production of 280,000 units, with 140,000 allocated for exports. [ 55 ] Later, production was delegated to Malaysia and Southeast Asia in order to increase sales in those regions. [ 42 ] In Thailand, the vehicle is called the Hilux Vigo . [ 52 ] For other European markets and South Africa, the Hilux was built in Durban, South Africa . [ 42 ] Hiluxes sold in Argentina and Brazil were built in Argentina , as with the previous generation Hilux. [ 56 ] The ladder frame chassis used by the seventh-generation Hilux is 45 percent stiffer compared to its predecessor. Combined with a reduction in the number of welded joints with the use of a unified inner frame, it has a higher torsional stiffness while the vertical rigidity is improved by stronger crossmembers . The model also used a new double wishbone front suspension which was said to improve stability and ride comfort. [ 57 ] The model is also considerably larger than the previous generation Hilux. For the double cab variant, the 2005 model is 400 mm (15.7 in) longer and 45 mm (1.8 in) wider. The deck is 165 mm (6.5 in) longer and both wider and taller by 50 mm (2.0 in). The increased size was achieved without a significant increase in the kerb weight. Drag coefficient is rated 0.36 (0.39 with over fenders), which was claimed to be "class-leading" during the time of its introduction. [ 57 ] In Singapore, the Hilux was available as a single cab with the 2.5 L engine or a double cab with the 3.0 L engine. This generation of the Hilux was introduced for Argentina on 2 March 2005 in Buenos Aires with a market launch in April. [ 58 ] This generation of the Hilux was also sold in Finland as the TruckMasters OX by Truck Masters Finland. Because of a modified rear suspension, the truck is registered in Finland as a light truck. The OX was only available with a 3.0-litre D-4D diesel engine.

Toyota has introduced a left hand drive Hilux Vigo in August 2008 while a right hand drive facelifted model was introduced in September 2008. These facelifted models were introduced in the Philippines in October 2008. Toyota also introduced a four-door extended cab called "Smart Cab" to replace all Xtra Cab models in E and G grade. The Smart Cab models were developed in Thailand and were only sold in the Thai market. [ 53 ] First facelift (front) First facelift (rear) 2011 facelift [ edit ] On 13 July 2011, Toyota announced that the Hilux would receive a facelift, including a redesigned front end (front grille similar to IMV-based Innova and Fortuner ) and other external styling changes, changes to the interior and a new turbocharged diesel engine rated at 107 kW (144 hp) and 343 N⋅m (253 lb⋅ft) of torque, as well as lower fuel consumption compared to the previous model. [ 61 ] This update was initially launched in Thailand [ 62 ] and later in Australia called as Toyota IMV Project. [ 63 ] Second facelift (front) Second facelift (rear) Hilux Vigo Champ [ edit ] Not to be confused with Toyota Hilux Champ . The Hilux Vigo Champ was introduced in Thailand in August 2012 as a significant "minor change" with a new front design and a revamped interior to reinforce perceived luxury. The front was redesigned from the A pillar forwards. With the exception of the doors, roof and tailgate, everything else was new: new guards, new headlights, new bumper, new bonnet, new three-bar grille, new taillights, a new rear bumper and new badges. There were also new mirrors and new alloy wheel designs. The interior features a new upper dashboard design with a new horizontal centre instrument cluster. Perceived quality was improved through the adoption of uniformly darker finishes with greater colour consistency throughout the interior. The high-end Double Cab version now came with a DVD player, rear camera and Bluetooth functionality. [ 64 ] This minor update upgraded the emission standard to Euro 4, updated the four-speed automatic transmission to five-speed, upgraded power rating of the 3.0-litre model from 122 to 128 kW (166 to 174 PS; 164 to 172 hp), increased torque from 343 to 360 N⋅m (253 to 266 ft⋅lb) for the five-speed automatic transmission, and the Smart Cab Prerunner 4×2 was introduced with automatic transmission. Other changes included a more efficient fuel injection system and the addition of a centre headrest on the rear double cab seat. The Vigo Champ CNG included the 2.7-litre 2TR-FE bi-fuel engine that could run on compressed natural gas (CNG).

[ 92 ] It was the first of the Toyota IMV family to receive a new generation, with the related Fortuner and Innova receiving new generations in July and November, respectively. [ 93 ] [ 94 ] [ 95 ] In some Asian markets such as Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Myanmar, and Pakistan, the model also adopted a new moniker, Hilux Revo . [ 96 ] [ 97 ] The model was subsequently introduced in the Philippines in July 2015, [ 98 ] Mexico and GCC countries in August 2015, [ 99 ] [ 100 ] [ 101 ] and Argentina and Brazil in November 2015, [ 102 ] [ 103 ] while in Europe specifications were unveiled in September 2015 for a mid-2016 market introduction. [ 104 ] [ 105 ] Introductions of the model in more markets started in 2016. In March 2016, the model was released in South Africa, where it is also produced. [ 106 ] In Malaysia, it was launched in May 2016, [ 107 ] while in Pakistan it was launched in September 2016. [ 97 ] In September 2017, Toyota released the Hilux in Japan for the first time since 2004. [ 108 ] The eighth-generation Hilux features the "Keen Look" design language with a slimmer headlight shape (with optional projector headlights and LED daytime running lights ). This design continues into the interior with similar AC vents and centre fascia design, which has been described as more "car-like". [ 109 ] First for a Hilux, this generation is available with an optional autonomous emergency braking system (AEB). [ 110 ] 2016 Hilux Invincible (GUN125; pre-facelift) Interior Development [ edit ] Development of the vehicle was led by Hiroki Nakajima as chief engineer, who visited 120 countries during its development. It was reported that in 2011, Toyota started over on the new Hilux just six months into development due to the release of the Volkswagen Amarok and Ford Ranger , which reset Toyota's benchmark for "car-like driving". Toyota President and CEO Akio Toyoda personally intervened to set the Hilux on a new development path. [ 109 ] Toyota stated the eighth-generation Hilux received larger cabin space in the front and rear with 19 mm (0.7 in) extra shoulder room, 8 mm (0.3 in) extra head room, 15 mm (0.6 in) higher seat height and 35 mm (1.4 in) larger rear knee room. It also featured a broader seat adjustment range and a larger 80-litre (17.6 imp gal; 21.1 US gal) fuel tank. It is also equipped with rear air vents as an option, making it one of the few pickups in its segment with rear air vents at the time of its launch. [ 111 ] The front bumper has a bigger bulge to meet new pedestrian safety regulations , while the lower section of the front bumper has been shaped to ensure the Hilux is more agile than its predecessor in off-road conditions. In the Middle East, the Hilux received an optional steel front bumper. [ 112 ] The approach angle is 31 degrees and the departure angle is 26 degrees, compared to the previous 30 and 23, respectively. [ 109 ] The new ladder-frame chassis gives the vehicle a 20-percent increase in torsional rigidity compared to the previous generation model. [ 113 ] The stronger FIRM (Frame with Integrated Rigidity Mechanism) makes use of high-tensile strength steel and more spot welds . The improved body structure is said to yield lower noise, vibration and harshness levels. It is also equipped with a newly developed Dynamic Control Suspension system and Body Control with Torque Demand. [ 114 ] Three different suspension setups are available for the Hilux for different markets. Vehicles destined for Australia, South Africa, Russia and South America receive an Australian-developed heavy-duty suspension setup that offers improved off-road performance, better vibration suppression and improved roll stiffness. Vehicles sold in Thailand receive a comfort-biased setup due to the large market of pickup trucks for personal use. The third suspension setup is a general setup that is "suited to all road conditions the world over." The suspension setups consist of front double wishbone with a thicker front stabiliser bar and rear leaf spring configuration. [ 114 ] It is aimed to give the Hilux a more "car-like" driving experience. [ 111 ] Markets [ edit ] Argentina [ edit ] As of 2016, the Argentine version has about 40% of locally and 60% of regionally made parts. [ 115 ] Australia [ edit ] During its introduction in Australia, the eighth-generation Hilux was offered with 31 variants, eight more than its predecessor, with 4×2 and 4×4 single, extra and double cabin styles, and WorkMate, SR and SR5 grade levels. [ 114 ] Toyota has also added Hi-Rider variants for SR and SR5 models, with added ride height, heavy-duty suspensions, larger front ventilated disc brakes and larger rear drum brakes . [ 116 ] Four engine options are offered in the market, ranging from the 2.4-litre turbo-diesel, 2.8-litre turbo-diesel (with different outputs for both 4×2 and 4×4), 2.7-litre petrol and 4.0-litre V6 petrol, and continues to be imported from Thailand. [ 111 ] The Australian specification Hilux offers an upgraded 3,500 kg (7,716 lb) towing capacity (for diesel manual) or 3,200 kg (7,055 lb) for diesel automatic model, while it also offers a payload of up to 1,240 kg (2,734 lb). It comes equipped with a standard reversing camera, up to seven airbags, electronic stability control, trailer sway control and rear parking sensors. In March 2017, the TRD appearance package became available. [ 117 ] In January 2018, Toyota introduced the Hilux Rugged X, Rogue and Rugged variants which were fully designed, developed and engineered in Australia. Based on the double-cab 4×4 Hilux, the three variants are targeted towards "urban adventurers" with off-road related changes and additions. [ 118 ] [ 119 ] The 2020 facelift was presented in August, which also introduced upgraded diesel engines and Toyota Safety Sense . [ 120 ] In September 2022, the Hilux Rogue received upgrades such as wider tracks and fenders, larger 18-inch wheels, rear disc brakes replacing drum brakes and larger front brake discs. It also gained extended front suspension arms, a lengthened rear axle, revised rear dampers, and a rear anti-roll bar, which are claimed to increase the vehicle's roll rigidity by 20 percent. [ 121 ] In January 2023, the GR Sport model became available in Australia with a different styling compared to the Hilux GR Sport in other markets, by sharing many elements with the Hilux Rogue. Powered with the 2.8-litre diesel engine, it received engine upgrades, heavy-duty suspension, wider fenders and wider track.

[ 113 ] The 2020 facelift model received an optional 2.8-litre diesel engine, and a GR Sport variant since 2022. [ 126 ] [ 127 ] Like the previous generation, this generation has also been sold as the TruckMasters OX in Finland by Truck Masters Finland since 2017. The modified suspension means that the truck is registered as a light truck in Finland, leading to lower taxes. [ 128 ] India [ edit ] In India, the Hilux was unveiled in January 2022 and went on sale in late March 2022. Mainly marketed as a "lifestyle utility vehicle", [ 129 ] it is offered in Low and High trim levels. [ 75 ] Models sold in India are assembled at Toyota Kirloskar Motor 's plant in Bidadi , Karnataka , and 30 percent of its components are sourced locally. [ 130 ] Japan [ edit ] The Hilux was reintroduced in Japan on 12 September 2017, after 13 years of hiatus. Initial orders for the vehicle exceeded 2,000 in the first month of sales.

[ 297 ] [ 298 ] [ 299 ] This reputation was highlighted in several episodes of the BBC motoring show Top Gear . In series 3 , episodes 5 and 6, a 1988 diesel N50 Hilux with 305,775 km (190,000 miles) on the odometer was subjected to considerable abuse, including being left on a beach for the incoming tide, left on top of a building as it was demolished , and being set on fire. [ 300 ] [ 301 ] The Hilux suffered severe structural damage, but was still running after being repaired with only the typical tools that would be found in a truck's toolbox (with the exception of a replaced windscreen for the driver's safety). [ 302 ] In later series, this Hilux became one of the background decorations in the Top Gear studio, and is now on display in the "World of Top Gear" exhibit at the National Motor Museum, Beaulieu . [ 303 ] In the later series 8 , episode 3, a Hilux was chosen by Jeremy Clarkson as his platform for creating an amphibious vehicle (though by the end of that episode the Hilux failed to start), and in the Top Gear: Polar Special Clarkson and James May raced a specially modified 2007 model Hilux to the magnetic north pole from Northern Canada – making that truck the first motor vehicle to have made that journey. The camera crew's vehicle from this episode was later modified and driven to near the summit of the Eyjafjallajökull erupting Icelandic volcano by James May, in Series 15 , Episode 1. In 1999, the Hilux appeared in a series of "Bugger" television advertisements in New Zealand and Australia, exaggerating its power and durability for comic effect. [ 304 ] [ 305 ] The adverts were banned in New Zealand after receiving 120 complaints, but later reinstated. [ 306 ] A world record was achieved by the support crew for the participants in the 2008/2009 Amundsen Omega 3 South Pole Race. The crew traveled in specially adapted Toyota Hiluxes modified by Arctic Trucks , completing a trip of over 5,000 km (3,100 miles) from Novo, a Russian Scientific Station in Antarctica to the Geographic South Pole and back again, making them the first 4×4s to reach the South Pole. [ 307 ] The return journey of 2,500 km (1,600 miles) from the South Pole to Novo Station was completed in a record 8 days and 17 hours. Racing [ edit ] See also: Toyota Hilux Dakar 2017 Toyota Hilux Dakar car Two Hilux pickups entered the Dakar Rally in 2012, prepared by the Imperial Toyota team of South Africa. Driver Giniel de Villiers achieved third place in the 2012 , second place overall in the 2013 , 4th in the 2014 , and again second place in the 2015 . These however, were heavily modified non-production versions built around a custom racing-only tubular chassis and using a larger capacity Toyota V8 engine . [ 308 ] Since 2016, the Dakar Rally Hilux has been prepared by Toyota Gazoo Racing WRT . Giniel achieved third place with it in 2016, 5th in 2017, 3rd in 2018 and 9th in 2019. Nasser Al-Attiyah won the 2019 Dakar Rally , earning the first ever Toyota victory in the Dakar Rally , he also came in second in 2018 and 2021. In the 2020 Dakar Rally , six Hilux cars were entered prepared by Gazoo Racing , and another nine by Overdrive Racing. A new, wider, heavier, featuring larger wheels Toyota GR DKR Hilux T1+ was built by Gazoo Racing for 2022 Dakar Rally , equipped with 3.5-L twin-turbo V6 engine, based on Toyota Land Cruiser 300 GR Sport. [ 309 ] Non-Standard Tactical Vehicles [ edit ] Two Hilux Facelift 2024 [ 310 ] with M134P minigun installed, and add-on armour at front and side; used as special reconnaissance vehicle by the Indonesian Marine Reconnaissance Battalion . [ 311 ] While not standard issue, various countries including the US military, particularly Special Operations forces, have used Toyota Hilux vehicles for various purposes. They are often acquired as technical vehicle or Non-Standard Tactical Vehicles (NSTVs) and modified for specific missions. These vehicles are favoured for their reliability, ease of maintenance, and ability to operate in diverse environments. [ 312 ] [ 313 ] Use by militant groups [ edit ] A Toyota Hilux with a DShKM machine gun used by the Kurdish YPG militia Due to its durability and reliability, the Toyota Hilux, along with the larger Toyota Land Cruiser (J70) , has become popular among paramilitary groups in war-torn regions as a technical . [ 314 ] According to terrorism analyst Andrew Exum , the Hilux is "the vehicular equivalent of the AK-47 . It's ubiquitous to insurgent warfare." [ 315 ] In 2015, US counter-terror officials inquired with Toyota how the Salafi jihadist extremist group Islamic State had apparently acquired large numbers of Toyota Hiluxes and Land Cruisers. Mark Wallace , the CEO of the Counter Extremism Project said, "Regrettably, the Toyota Land Cruiser and Hilux have effectively become almost part of the ISIS brand." [ 316 ] The Toyota War between Libya and Chad in 1986 and 1987 was named as such because of the heavy, successful use of Hilux and Land Cruiser trucks for technicals.
