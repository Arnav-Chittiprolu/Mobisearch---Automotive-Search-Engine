This is demonstrated [ original research? ] through some recently developed safety features, including a method of overcoming the "blind spots" in the driver's view to the rear through a system known as BLIS ( Blind Spot Information System ). The C30 also features a four-wheel anti-lock braking system (ABS), electronic stability program (ESP), traction control system and front, side and curtain airbags, front and rear crumple zones, and a stiff occupant cell. [ 24 ] The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) awarded the Volvo C30 their Top Safety Pick award. The C30 was granted its highest rating of "good" in front, side, rear and roof strength tests and has Electronic Stability Control as standard equipment to receive the award. The Volvo C30 has a patented front and rear structure using four different grades of steel to absorb and redistribute impact energy around the body of the coupe. Volvo's Whiplash Protection System and Side Impact Protection System with side airbags and Inflatable Curtain are also standard. [ 25 ] The seat belts have pretensioners to protect the occupants against unexpected accidents. [ 26 ] The car also uses Volvo's Intelligent Driver Information System (IDIS) which continuously monitors the car's preemptive systems such as steering wheel angle, pedal depressions, and overall factors that help the vehicle's computer to decide if the driver is busy or distracted merging or turning, and will then accordingly delay certain data or alerts that are unimportant. [ 27 ] The C30 has been criticized because in an effort to make it more responsive in curves it has become less reliable on ice or snow where the rear end can more easily lose its grip compared to other Volvo models.

The prototype C30 electric car used an 82 kW electric motor, and had a 24 kWh lithium-ion battery pack installed in the propshaft tunnel and in the space normally occupied by the fuel tank, outside the passenger compartment and away from the deformations zones. The C30 electric delivers up to 150 km (93 mi) under the NEDC cycle. [ 50 ] A drivable C30 prototype was presented in September 2009. An updated prototype (with complete interior and full instrumentation, and enhanced battery packaging) was unveiled in the 2010 North American International Auto Show . [ 51 ] [ 52 ] The C30 DRIVe Electric concept car was exhibited in the 2010 Paris Motor Show and presented as the C30 DRIVe. [ 53 ] Field testing of about 50 C30 electric cars was conducted in Sweden beginning the fourth quarter of 2010, mainly internally at the Volvo Car Corporation. [ 54 ] A Volvo C30 Electric was also part of the One Tonne Life project in which a family was given the task of living as climate-smart as possible for a period of six months. [ 54 ] In July 2012 Volvo delivered 15 Volvo C30 electric cars as part of an open road test-drive project in Shanghai . [ 55 ] The electric C30 has a 24 kWh lithium-ion battery, supplied by US manufacturer EnerDel . [ 56 ] The electric motor, the motor controller, the charger and other drivetrain components were supplied by Swiss manufacturer BRUSA Elektronik AG . [ 57 ] Top speed was estimated by Volvo to be 130 km/h (81 mph), with acceleration from 0–50 km/h (0–31 mph) in 4 seconds. The C30 Electric can be recharged from a regular household power socket and a full charge takes about 7 hours. The all-electric range is up to 150 kilometres (93 mi). The batteries are installed where the fuel tank normally sits and also in a special compartment in the C30's central tunnel, and as a result, the luggage compartment is unchanged. [ 54 ] In August 2012 Volvo ordered a second supply of battery packs from EnerDel to build an internal test fleet together with Siemens . [ 58 ] [ 59 ] Frontal crash test of the C30 Electric to assess the safety of the battery pack . The Volvo C30 Electric is equipped with three climate systems: one supplies the passengers with heating or cooling; one cools or warms the battery pack as necessary; and the electric motor and power electronics are water-cooled. The climate control in the passenger cabin features a bioethanol -powered heater, a solution chosen by Volvo to get heating without compromising the battery driving range, but the driver has the option to run the climate unit on electricity from the batteries. Ethanol is the default mode and the ethanol tank can carry 14.5 litres (3.8 US gal) of bio-ethanol. Volvo tested the C30 in winter conditions in temperatures as low as −20 °C (−4 °F) in 2011. [ 60 ] Awards [ edit ] The C30 DRIVe was one of the five finalists to the 2011 Green Car Vision Award . [ 61 ] In July 2012, the Volvo C30 electric was named the "Green Car of the Year" in China at the 4th China New Energy Mobility Summit. [ 55 ] Production [ edit ] The Volvo C30 Electric body was built on the regular assembly line in the Ghent, Belgium factory, and then the glider is transported to Gothenburg for installation of the motor, batteries and other C30 Electric-specific assemblies. [ 54 ] As a low production car, Volvo intended to lease the Volvo C30 Electric only to corporate customers, mainly companies, authorities and government agencies. Initial deliveries were scheduled for the third quarter of 2011 throughout Europe, including in Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway. [ 62 ] Volvo planned to build about 250 cars by the end of 2012, and possibly more if market interest occasioned. [ 54 ] Volvo also planned to allocate a total of 100 Volvo C30 Electrics for the US, half of which would be offered on the West Coast and the other half on the East Coast . Volvo targeted the leases to corporate and government fleet users at a price of around US$2,100 per month in the U.S. and €1,500 per month in Europe on a three-year lease. As this pricing was much higher than other electric cars available in the market by 2011, demand was expected to be low, and Volvo explained that their prices reflect the actual cost of the limited-production car. [ 63 ] [ 64 ] During 2011, 6 units were registered in France. [ 65 ] A total of 126 units have been leased in Sweden through September 2012 since 2011. [ 66 ] As of July 5, 2013, the C30 was no longer available to order from Volvo, nor did it remain the model line up on the Volvo Cars website. The last C30's from current stock were intended to be registered by the end of 2013, but none were produced after July 2013. Production of the C30 Electric began in June 2011. Delivery of first ten C30 Electric went to the energy company Göteborg Energi with deliveries starting at the autumn of 2010. [ 67 ] Leasing to fleet customers in Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway began in the third quarter of 2011. [ 54 ] A total of 209 units have been leased in Europe through October 2012, [ 68 ] Sweden is the top selling market with 149 units delivered since 2011 through March 2013. [ 66 ] [ 69 ] [ 70 ] Production ceased in December 2012 and the C30 line was discontinued in 2013. [ 71 ] [ 72 ] Marketing [ edit ] In the 'DRIVe Around the World' C30 DRIVe campaign, a Facebook game was created to challenge users to virtually drive a Volvo C30 DRIVe to a Facebook friend who lives as close to 1,333 kilometres away from Sweden to Egypt as possible. The challenge began in 2009-11-16 and ended in 2010-02-05. The game was promoted with an animated trailer, which received 569,000 views worldwide in 169 countries. The Volvo fan page (www.facebook.com/volvo) was rewarded by a donation from Volvo Cars of 15,000 EURO in the Volvo Fans' team name to a Gold Standard certified wind farm project in Izmir, Turkey. [ 73 ] In the One Tonne Life project, the Lindell family lived in a temporary home from A-hus and drove Volvo C30 Electric. [ 74 ] The project house was designed by architect Gert Wingårdh. [ 75 ] Motorsport [ edit ] Volvo Polestar driver Robert Dahlgren won the 2010 Scandinavian Touring Car Championship . In addition, after 8 of 9 rounds of STCC Driver's Championship 2010, Robert Dahlgren lead the tournament, and Volvo Polestar placed 2nd in the team championship. [ 76 ] Robert Dahlgren won the 2010 STCC Driver's Championship, while Volvo Polestar won the 2010 STCC Team Championship. [ 77 ] In the 2011 World Touring Car Championship season , the Polestar Racing team used Volvo C30 DRIVe as their race car. [ 78 ] Volvo C30 Electric shared first place in the 130-kilometre Michelin Challenge Bibendum rally plus awards for handling, well to wheel CO 2 emissions and local emissions. [ 79 ] Polestar Racing entered 2011 WTCC season with one Volvo C30 DRIVe racer driven by Robert Dahlgren. [ 80 ] In 2011 World Touring Car Championship, Robert Dahlgren crashed out of qualifying in Macau race, ending the Polestar Racing team's season career. [ 81 ] The C30 won 5 races during the 2011 Pirelli World Challenge season . STCC-Volvo (2010) [ edit ] It is a race car version of C30 designed for the 2010 Swedish Touring Car Championship . [ 82 ] Marketing [ edit ] As part of the European C30 launch, a series of 16 different television commercials were created by Fuel London (part of Euro RSCG Worldwide) under the campaign's theme, "A Product of Free Will." [ 83 ] As part of the US C30 launch, Volvo C30's configuration site featured a fluctuating price quote for the identically equipped vehicles. Volvo's intention was to determine what potential buyers are willing to pay and how many vehicles they should ship to the States. [ 35 ] In Stephenie Meyer's popular Twilight novel series, it is suggested that Edward drives a "shiny" and "silver" Volvo S60-R , a fast sleeper car that doesn't call attention to the Cullen family's wealth. The film series partnered with Volvo to place a Volvo C30 in the 2008 Twilight film, feeling that the C30 better suited the persona of a 108 year old vampire pretending to be a 17-year-old high school student. Volvo reported an increase in the sale of the C30 in the US market following the film's release, and helped change the perception of Volvo as a "cool" car in a younger generation of buyers.
