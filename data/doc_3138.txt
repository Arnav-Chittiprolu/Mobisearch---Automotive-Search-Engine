== Operating principle ==
{{more citations needed section|date=October 2022}}
[[File:Annotated rude carb.JPG|thumb|1979 [[Evinrude Outboard Motors|Evinrude]] Type I side draft carburetor]]

Air from the atmosphere enters the carburetor (usually via an [[air cleaner]]), has fuel added within the carburetor, passes into the [[inlet manifold]], then through the [[Poppet valve#Usage in internal combustion engines|inlet valve(s)]], and finally into the [[combustion chamber]]. Most engines use a single carburetor shared among all of the cylinders, though some high-performance engines historically had multiple carburetors.

The simplest carburetors work on [[Bernoulli's principle]]: the [[static pressure]] of the intake air at the fuel entry point, which can be in a tube which is constant diameter, reduces at higher speeds compared with the pressure in the float chamber which is vented to ambient air pressure, with the pressure difference then forcing more fuel into the airstream. If the tube is a constant diameter the configuration is slightly simpler than in the cross-section diagram shown above right. 

In most cases (except for the ''accelerator pump''), the driver pressing the [[throttle pedal]] does not directly increase the fuel entering the engine. Instead, the airflow through the carburetor increases, which in turn increases the amount of fuel drawn into the intake mixture.

Bernoulli's Principle applies (apart from friction and viscosity and turbulence etc.) to both the air and the fuel, so that the pressure reduction in the air flow tends to be proportional to the square of the intake airspeed, and the fuel in the main jets will obtain a speed as the square root of the pressure reduction so the two will be proportional to each other. If the pressure reduction is taken as from a reduction of area along the air flow rather than from ambient pressure to the fuel entry point the effect can be described as the [[Venturi effect]], but that is simply a derivation from the [[Bernoulli principle]] at two positions. 

The actual fuel and air flows are more complicated and need correction. This might be done variously at lower speeds or higher speeds, or over the whole range by a variable [[emulsion]] device to add air to the fuel after the main jets/s. In [[SU carburettor|SU]] and other (e.g. [[Zenith Carburettor Company (British)#Products|Zenith-Stromberg]]) variable jet carburetors, it was mainly controlled by varying the jet size.

The orientation of the carburetor is a key design consideration. Older engines used '''updraft''' carburetors, where the air enters from below the carburetor and exits through the top. From the late 1930s, '''downdraft''' carburetors become more commonly used (especially in the United States), along with '''side draft''' carburetors (especially in Europe).

===Main metering circuit===
The main metering circuit usually consists of barrel/s which reduces to a narrow part where the air is at its highest speed, forming a [[Venturi tube|venturi]]. Fuel is introduced into the air stream at that narrow part through small tubes leading from the main jet.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lind |first1=Wallace Ludwig |title=Internal-combustion engines; their principles and applications to automobile, aircraft, and marine purposes |date=1920 |publisher=Boston, Ginn |page=71 |url=https://archive.org/details/internalcombust01lindgoog/page/n80/mode/2up |access-date=19 November 2022}}</ref>

Downstream of the venturi is a [[throttle]] (usually in the form of a [[butterfly valve]]) which is used to control the amount of air entering the carburetor. In a car, this throttle is usually mechanically connected to the vehicle's throttle pedal, which varies engine speed.

At lesser throttle openings, the air speed through the venturi may be insufficient to maintain the fuel flow, so then the fuel may be supplied by the carburetor's [[#Idle circuit|idle]] and [[#Off-idle circuit|off-idle circuits]] which will work even with a low volume of air because the narrow gap between the edge of the butterfly plate and the body gives sufficient local air speed at those jets.

At greater throttle openings, the speed of air passing through the venturi increases, which lowers the pressure of the air and draws more fuel into the airstream.<ref>{{cite web |title=Carburetor Basics - Tech Article - Chevy High Performance Magazine |url=https://www.motortrend.com/how-to/83118-carburetor-basics/ |website=MotorTrend |access-date=28 October 2022 |language=en |date=1 June 2002}}</ref> At the same time, the reduced manifold vacuum results in less fuel flow through the idle and off-idle circuits.

==== Choke ====
During cold weather fuel vaporizes less readily and tends to condense on the walls of the intake manifold, starving the cylinders of fuel and making [[Cold start (automotive)|cold starts]] difficult.  Additional fuel is required (for a given amount of air) to start and run the engine until it warms up, provided by a ''[[choke valve]]''.

While the engine is warming up the choke valve is partially closed, restricting the flow of air at the entrance to the carburetor. This increases the vacuum in the main metering circuit, causing more fuel to be supplied to the engine via the main jets. Prior to the late 1950s the choke was manually operated by the driver, often using a lever or knob on the [[dashboard]]. Since then, automatic chokes became more commonplace. These either use a bimetallic [[thermostat]] to automatically regulate the choke based on the temperature of the engine's coolant liquid, an electrical resistance heater to do so, or air drawn through a tube connected to an engine exhaust source.  A choke left closed after the engine has warmed up increases the engine's fuel consumption and exhaust gas emissions, and causes the engine to run rough and lack power due to an over-rich fuel mixture.

However, excessive fuel can [[flooded engine|flood]] an engine and prevent it from starting. To remove the excess fuel, many carburetors with automatic chokes allow it to be held open (by manually, depressing the accelerator pedal to the floor and briefly holding it there while cranking the starter) to allow extra air into the engine until the excess fuel is cleared out.

Another method used by carburetors to improve the operation of a cold engine is a ''fast idle [[Cam (mechanism)|cam]]'', which is connected to the choke and prevents the throttle from closing fully while the choke is in operation. The resulting increase in idle speed provides a more stable idle for a cold engine (by better atomizing the cold fuel) and helps the engine warm up quicker.

=== Idle circuit ===
The system within a carburetor that meters fuel when the engine is running at low RPM. The idle circuit is generally activated by vacuum near the (near closed) throttle plate, where the air speed increases to cause a low-pressure area in the idle passage/port, thus causing fuel to flow through the idle jet. The idle jet is set at some constant value by the carburetor manufacturer, thus flowing a specified amount of fuel.

===Off-idle circuit===
Many carburetors use an off-idle circuit, which includes an additional fuel jet which is briefly used as the throttle starts to open. This jet is located in a low-pressure area caused by the high air speed near the (partly closed) throttle. The additional fuel it provides is used to compensate for the reduced vacuum that occurs when the throttle is opened, thus smoothing the transition from the idle circuit to the main metering circuit.

===Power valve===
In a [[four-stroke engine]] it is often desirable to provide extra fuel to the engine at high loads (to increase the power output and reduce [[engine knocking]]). A 'power valve', which is a spring-loaded valve in the carburetor that is held shut by engine vacuum, is often used to do so. As the airflow through the carburetor increases, the reduced manifold vacuum pulls the power valve open, allowing more fuel into the main metering circuit.

In a [[two-stroke engine]], the carburetor power valve operates in the opposite manner: in most circumstances the valve allows extra fuel into the engine, then at a certain engine [[RPM]] it closes to reduce the fuel entering the engine. This is done in order to extend the engine's maximum RPM, since many two-stroke engines can temporarily achieve higher RPM with a leaner air-fuel ratio.

This is not to be confused with the unrelated [[Two-stroke power valve system|exhaust power valve]] arrangements used on two-stroke engines.

==== Metering rod / step-up rod ====
A metering rod or step-up rod system is sometimes used as an alternative to a power valve in a four-stroke engine in order to supply extra fuel at high loads. One end of the rods is tapered, which sits in the main metering jets and acts as a valve for fuel flow in the jets. At high engine loads, the rods are lifted away from the jets (either mechanically or using manifold vacuum), increasing the volume of fuel flow through the jet. These systems have been used by the [[Quadrajet|Rochester Quadrajet]] and in the 1950s [[Carter Carburetor|Carter]] carburetors.

===Accelerator pump===
While the main metering circuit can adequately supply fuel to the engine in steady-state conditions, the inertia of  fuel (being higher than that of air) causes a temporary shortfall as the throttle is opened. Therefore, an accelerator pump is often used to briefly provide extra fuel as the throttle is opened.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Packer, Ed |title=Know Your Carburetor- what it is, what it does |journal=Popular Mechanics |date=July 1953 |page=183 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ENwDAAAAMBAJ |access-date=19 November 2022 |publisher=Hearst Magazines |language=en}}</ref> When the driver presses the throttle pedal, a small [[piston pump|piston]] or [[diaphragm pump|diaphragm]] pump injects extra fuel directly into the carburetor throat.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hillier |first1=V.A.W. |last2=Pittuck |first2=F.W. |year=1966 |title=Fundamentals of Motor Vehicle Technology |chapter=Section 3.6 |edition=Second |publisher=Hutchinson Educational |isbn=9780091107116}}</ref>

The accelerator pump can also be used to "prime" an engine with extra fuel prior to attempting a [[Cold start (automotive)|cold start]].{{citation needed|date=July 2023}}

==Fuel supply==

===Float chamber===
[[File:Holley Visiflo.jpg|thumb|Holley "Visi-Flo" model #1904 carburetors from the 1950s, factory equipped with transparent glass bowls]]
[[File:Carburetor components.png|thumb|A float-type carburetor used in airplanes]]

In order to ensure an adequate supply at all times, carburetors include a reservoir of fuel, called a "float chamber" or "float bowl". Fuel is delivered to the float chamber by a [[Fuel pump (engine)|fuel pump]] or by gravity with the fuel tank located higher than the carburetor. A floating inlet valve regulates the fuel entering the float chamber, assuring a constant level. In some small engines that may instead of a float chamber just use a fuel tank close below the carburetor and use the fuel suction to supply the fuel.

Unlike in a fuel injected engine, the fuel system in a carbureted engine is not pressurized. For engines where the intake air travelling through the carburetor is pressurized (such as where the carburetor is downstream of a [[supercharger]]) the entire carburetor must be contained in an airtight pressurized box to operate.{{citation needed|date=November 2022}} However, this is not necessary where the carburetor is upstream of the supercharger.

Problems of fuel boiling and [[vapor lock]] can occur in carbureted engines, especially in hotter climates. Since the float chamber is located close to the engine, heat from the engine (including for several hours after the engine is shut off) can cause the fuel to heat up to the point of vaporization. This causes air bubbles in the fuel (similar to the air bubbles that necessitate [[brake bleeding]]), which prevents the flow of fuel and is known as 'vapor lock'.

To avoid pressurizing the float chamber, vent tubes allow ambient air to enter and exit the float chamber. These tubes may instead extend into the carburetor air flow prior to where the fuel flows in, in order to use the Venturi effect to achieve suitable pressure difference rather than the Bernoulli principle which applies when the pressure difference is related to the ambient air pressure.

===Diaphragm chamber===
If an engine must be operated when the carburetor is not in an upright orientation (for example in a chainsaw or airplane), a float chamber and gravity activated float valve would not be suitable. Instead, a diaphragm chamber is typically used. This consists of a flexible [[Diaphragm (mechanical device)|diaphragm]] on one side of the fuel chamber, connected to a [[needle valve]] which regulates the fuel entering the chamber. As the flowrate of the air in the chamber (controlled by the throttling valve/butterfly valve) decreases, the diaphragm moves inward (downward), which closes the needle valve to admit less fuel. As the flowrate of the air in the chamber increases, the diaphragm moves outward (upward) which opens the needle valve to admit more fuel, allowing the engine to generate more power. A balanced state is reached which creates a steady fuel reservoir level, that remains constant in any orientation.

== Other components ==
[[File:Manly 1919 Fig 133 Fordson intake.png|thumb|Fordson tractor [[Vaporizer (internal combustion engine)|vaporizer]]- cutaway view]]

Other components that have been used on carburetors include:
* Air bleeds allowing air into various portions of the fuel passages, to premix air and fuel, and minimise vaporization, and to largely correct air/fuel ratio over a large range, typically referred to as the [[emulsion]] system. 
* [[Miss Shilling's orifice|Fuel flow restrictors]] in aircraft engines, to prevent fuel starvation during inverted flight.
* Heated [[Vaporizer (internal combustion engine)|vaporizers]] to assist with the atomization of the fuel, particularly for engines using [[kerosene]], [[tractor vaporizing oil]] or in [[petrol-paraffin engine]]s<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hutton |first1=Frederick Remsen |title=The gas-engine. A treatise on the internal-combustion engine using gas, gasoline, kerosene, alcohol, or other hydrocarbon as source of energy |date=1908 |publisher=New York, Wiley |page=197 |url=https://archive.org/details/gasengineatreat03huttgoog/mode/2up |access-date=19 November 2022}}</ref>
* [[Early fuel evaporator]]s
* [[Feedback carburetor]]s, which adjusted the fuel/air mixture in response to signals from an [[oxygen sensor]], in order to allow a [[catalytic converter]] to be used
* Constant vacuum carburetors (also called variable choke carburetors), whereby the throttle cable is connected directly to the throttle cable plate. Pulling the cord caused raw gasoline to enter the carburetor, creating a large emission of hydrocarbons.<ref name="Stermer">{{cite book|first=Bill |last=Stermer |title=Harley-Davidson Motorcycles |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Rkj8y8QYppMC&pg=PA154 |publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn=978-1-61060-951-7 |page=154 |date=2002}}</ref>
* Constant velocity carburetors use a variable opening in the intake air stream after movement of the throttle plate from the accelerator pedal. This variable opening is controlled by pressure/vacuum at the variable opening itself. This pressure-controlled opening provides relatively even intake pressure throughout the engine's speed and load ranges.

== Two-barrel and four-barrel designs ==
[[File:1961 Ferrari 250 TR 61 Spyder Fantuzzi engine.jpg|thumb|Six two-barrel [[Weber carburetors]] on a [[Ferrari]] [[Ferrari Colombo engine|Colombo]] [[V12 engine|V12]]]]
[[File:HighPerformanceCarburetor.jpg|thumb|right|High-performance four-barrel Holley 4150 carburetor]]

The basic design for a carburetor consists of a single venturi (main metering circuit), though designs with two or four venturi (two-barrel and four-barrel carburetors respectively) are also quite commonplace. Typically the barrels consist of "primary" barrel(s) used for lower load situations and secondary barrel(s) activating when required to provide additional air/fuel at higher loads. The primary and secondary venturi are often sized differently and incorporate different features to suit the situations in which they are used.

Many four-barrel carburetors use two primary and two secondary barrels. A four-barrel design of two primary and two secondary barrels was commonly used in [[V8 engine]]s to conserve fuel at low engine speeds while still affording an adequate supply at high.

{{clear left}}
The use of multiple carburetors (e.g., a carburetor for each cylinder or pair of cylinders) also results in the intake air being drawn through multiple venturi.<ref>{{cite book|last=Hibbard |first=Jeff |title=Baja Bugs & Buggies |publisher=HP Books |year=1983 |page=24 |isbn=0-89586-186-0}}</ref> Some high-performance engines have used multiple two-barrel or four-barrel carburetors, for example six two-barrel carburetors on Ferrari V12s.

== History ==
{{anchor|Surface carburetor}}
In 1826, American engineer [[Samuel Morey]] received a patent for a "gas or vapor engine", which had a carburetor that mixed [[turpentine]] and air.<ref>{{cite web |title=Samuel Morey |url=https://www.lindahall.org/about/news/scientist-of-the-day/samuel-morey |website=The Linda Hall Library |access-date=22 October 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=A Detailed History Of The Internal Combustion Engine |url=https://www.hotcars.com/internal-combustion-engine-history/ |website=HotCars |access-date=22 October 2022 |date=22 April 2021}}</ref> The design did not reach production.

In the United States, carburetors were the common method of fuel delivery for most US-made gasoline (petrol) engines until the late 1980s, when fuel injection became the preferred method.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yLZeQwqNmdgC&pg=PA199 |title=World History of the Automobile |first=Erik |last=Eckermann |pages=199–200 |publisher=Society of Automotive Engineers |year=2001 |access-date=2016-05-09 |isbn=978-0-7680-0800-5}}</ref> One of the last motorsport users of carburetors was NASCAR, which switched to electronic fuel injection after the [[2011 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2011 Sprint Cup series]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Mark |last=Aumann |url=http://www.nascar.com/news/111018/inside-nascar-fuel-injection-replaces-carburetor/index.html |title=NASCAR takes 'really big step' with fuel injection |website=Nascar.com |date=11 January 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025133612/http://www.nascar.com/news/111018/inside-nascar-fuel-injection-replaces-carburetor/index.html |archive-date=25 October 2012 |access-date=19 January 2014}}</ref> NASCAR still uses the four-barrel carburetor in the [[NASCAR Xfinity Series]].

In Europe, carburetors were largely replaced by fuel injection in the late 1980s, although fuel injection had been increasingly used in luxury cars and sports cars since the 1970s. [[European Economic Community|EEC]] legislation required all vehicles sold and produced in member countries to have a catalytic converter after December 1992. This legislation had been in the pipeline for some time, with many cars becoming available with catalytic converters or fuel injection from around 1990.

== Icing in aircraft engine carburetors ==

[[file:Carburetor Icing diagram.png|thumb|right|upright|The formation of carburetor ice may reduce or block fuel-air flow to the engine.]]

A significant concern for aircraft engines is the formation of ice inside the carburetor. The temperature of air within the carburetor can be reduced by up to 40&nbsp;°C (72&nbsp;°F),<ref name="PHAK">{{cite book |title=Pilots' Handbook of Aeronautical Knowledge |publisher=US Federal Aviation Administration |pages=7–9–7–10 |url=https://www.faa.gov/sites/faa.gov/files/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aviation/phak/09_phak_ch7.pdf |access-date=11 April 2022}}</ref> due to a combination of the reduced air pressure in the venturi and the [[latent heat]] of the evaporating fuel. The conditions during the descent to landing are particularly conducive to icing, since the engine is run at idle for a prolonged period with the throttle closed. Icing can also occur in cruise conditions at altitude.

A carburetor heat system is often used to prevent icing.<ref name="PHAK"/> This system consists of a secondary air intake which passes around the exhaust, in order to heat the air before it enters the carburetor. Typically, the system is operated by the pilot manually switching the intake air to travel via the heated intake path as required. The carburetor heat system reduces the power output (due to the lower density of heated air) and causes the intake air filter to be bypassed, therefore the system is only used when there is a risk of icing.<ref name="PHAK"/>

If the engine is operating at idle RPM, another method to prevent icing is to periodically open the throttle, which increases the air temperature within the carburetor.<ref name="PHAK"/>

Carburetor icing also occurs on other applications and various methods have been employed to solve this problem.  On inline engines the intake and exhaust manifolds are on the same side of the head. Heat from the exhaust is used to warm the intake manifold and in turn the carburetor.  On V configurations, exhaust gases were directed from one head through the intake cross over to the other head. One method for regulating the exhaust flow on the cross over for intake warming was a weighted eccentric butterfly valve called a heat riser that remained closed at idle and opened at higher exhaust flow.  Some vehicles used a heat stove around the exhaust manifold.  It was connected to the air filter intake via tubing and supplied warmed air to the air filter.  A vacuum controlled butterfly valve pre heat tube on the intake horn of the air cleaner would open allowing cooler air when engine load increased.
