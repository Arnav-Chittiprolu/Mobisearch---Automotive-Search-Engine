From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia (Redirected from Polyglycol ether ) Class of chemical compounds Ethylene glycol monomethyl ether , a glycol ether Glycol ethers are a class of chemical compounds consisting of alkyl ethers that are based on glycols such as ethylene glycol or propylene glycol . They are commonly used as solvents in paints and cleaners. They have good solvent properties while having higher boiling points than the lower-molecular-weight ethers and alcohols . History [ edit ] The name Cellosolve was registered in 1924 as a United States trademark by Carbide & Carbon Chemicals Corporation (a division [ 1 ] of Union Carbide Corporation ) for "Solvents for Gums, Resins, Cellulose Esters, and the Like". Ethyl Cellosolve , or simply Cellosolve , consists mainly of ethylene glycol monoethyl ether and was introduced as a lower-cost solvent alternative to ethyl lactate . Butyl Cellosolve ( ethylene glycol monobutyl ether ) was introduced in 1928, and Methyl Cellosolve ( ethylene glycol monomethyl ether ) in 1929. [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Types [ edit ] Glycol ethers are designated E-series or P-series for those made from ethylene oxide or propylene oxide , respectively.  Typically, E-series glycol ethers are found in pharmaceuticals, sunscreens, cosmetics, inks, dyes and water-based paints, while P-series glycol ethers are used in degreasers, cleaners, aerosol paints and adhesives. Both E- and P-series glycol ethers can be used as intermediates that undergo further chemical reactions, producing glycol diethers and glycol ether acetates. [ citation needed ] P-series glycol ethers are marketed as having lower toxicity than the E-series.

[ citation needed ] In the early 1990s, studies found a higher than expected rates of human reproductive health issues in both males and females, such as elevated risk of miscarriages among women who worked in semiconductor plants [ 4 ] as well as male gonadal changes such as testicular atrophy and sperm morphology changes, [ 5 ] which was traced back to glycol ethers; in particular: ethylene glycol ethers [ 6 ] [ which? ] used in the photoresist substances that coat semiconductors . [ 7 ] One study suggests that occupational exposure to glycol ethers is related to lowering the motility of the sperm and sperm count , [ 8 ] a finding disputed by the chemical industry.
