Energy Wikipedia:WikiProject Energy Template:WikiProject Energy energy Dispute about elimination of redirects for a non-canonical name [ edit ] This revert was in error because it replaced a cell's most typical name with a redirect from a much less common name to the same article. 99.38.148.203 ( talk ) 17:18, 28 February 2010 (UTC) Banned user Banned user Nrcprm2026 is not permitted to contribute. Hipocrite ( talk ) 20:29, 28 February 2010 (UTC) [ reply ] I would suggest a starting point, go to Hipocrite's talk page ask why they are reverting.  Right now there is not much to give a third opinion on, since there is no discussion here.  If the two of you talk, maybe it can be worked out between you without any other involvement.  I will remove the third opinion request and if a conversation with Hipocrite do not work out come back and ask for a third opinion again. ~~ GB fan ~~ talk 18:20, 28 February 2010 (UTC) [ reply ] Parts [ edit ] Suggest include parameters for the anode , cathode and electrolyte chemistries, when discharging.-- Lagoset ( talk ) 12:49, 25 March 2014 (UTC) [ reply ] Retrieved from " https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk:Galvanic_cells&oldid=1231185970 " Categories : Template-Class Chemistry pages NA-importance Chemistry pages WikiProject Chemistry articles Template-Class energy pages NA-importance energy pages
