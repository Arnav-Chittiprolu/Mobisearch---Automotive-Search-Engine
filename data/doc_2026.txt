From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The South African Car of the Year is an annual Car of the Year award organised by the South African Guild of Mobility Journalists. The award process is widely regarded for its attention to depth and detail. The vehicles that are selected as finalists are thoroughly tested and driven for a number of days by the journalists before the winner is chosen based upon the journalist's scores.
