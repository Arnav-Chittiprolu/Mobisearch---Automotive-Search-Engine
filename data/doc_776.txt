Make your donation now Jump to navigation Jump to search The internet we were promised. [ edit ] Thank you for considering a donation to the Wikimedia Foundation. We invite you to reflect on the number of times you visited Wikipedia in the last year. If the knowledge you gained here was valuable, please join the 2% of readers who donate. Any amount helps: $5, $20, $50 , or whatever feels right to you today. The internet we were promised—a place of free, collaborative, and accessible knowledge—is under constant threat. On Wikipedia, volunteers work together to create and verify the pages you rely on, supported by tools that undo vandalism within minutes, ensuring the information you seek is trustworthy. If Wikipedia has given you useful knowledge this year, please give back. There are no small contributions: every edit counts, every donation counts. Thank you.
