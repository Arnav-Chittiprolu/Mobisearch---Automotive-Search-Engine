https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Mazda_vehicles

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia This is a list of Mazda motor vehicle models. Mazda had used a number of different marques in the Japan market, including Autozam , Eunos , and Efini , although they have been phased out. In the early 1990s Mazda almost created a luxury marque, Amati , to challenge Acura , Infiniti , and Lexus in North America, but this never happened, leaving the near-luxury Millenia to the Mazda brand. Many Mazda vehicles have been rebadged and sold with the Ford brand during the alliance of both companies. Most are noted in the pages of individual vehicles. Previous sports models of Mazda's regular vehicles go by the Mazdaspeed name. Mazdaspeed is Mazda's in-house race and street car tuning arm and is highly involved in both amateur and professional motorsports. Current production vehicles [ edit ] This is the current Mazda automobile listing internationally.
