Yvelines ( French pronunciation: [ivlin] ⓘ ) is a department in the western part of the Île-de-France region in Northern France . In 2019, it had a population of 1,448,207. [ 4 ] Its prefecture is Versailles , home to the Palace of Versailles , the principal residence of the King of France from 1682 until 1789, a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 1979. Yvelines' subprefectures are Saint-Germain-en-Laye , Mantes-la-Jolie and Rambouillet . History [ edit ] Yvelines was created from the western part of the former department of Seine-et-Oise on 1 January 1968 in accordance with a law passed on 10 January 1964 and a décret d'application (a decree specifying how a law should be enforced) from 26 February 1965. It inherited Seine-et-Oise's official number of 78 since it took up the largest portion of its territory. In addition to this, it inherited Seine-et-Oise's prefecture, Versailles . Yvelines derives its name from the Forest of Yveline , next to Rambouillet . [ 5 ] It gained the communes of Châteaufort and Toussus-le-Noble from the adjacent department of Essonne in 1969. The departmental capital, Versailles , which grew up around Louis XIV's château , was also the French capital for more than a century under the Ancien Régime and again between 1871 and 1879 during the early years of the Third Republic . Since then the château has continued to welcome the French Parliament when it is called upon to sit in a congressional sitting (with both houses sitting together) in order to enact constitutional changes or to listen to a formal declaration by the President . [ 6 ] Geography [ edit ] Situation [ edit ] Yvelines is bordered by the departments of Val-d'Oise on the north, Hauts-de-Seine on the east, Essonne on the southeast, Eure-et-Loir on the southwest and Eure on the west. The eastern part of the department, as well as its northern part along the Seine , is part of the Paris metropolitan area, but the rest of the department is rural, much of it covered by the Forest of Rambouillet (also known as the Forest of Yveline, from which the name of the department is derived). Two regional parks can be found in Yvelines: Haute Vallée de Chevreuse Regional Natural Park and part of Vexin Français Park. Yvelines is home to one of France's best known golf courses, La Tuilerie-Bignon, in the village of Saint-Nom-la-Bretèche . Principal towns [ edit ] Besides Versailles (the prefecture and most populous commune) and the subprefectures of Mantes-la-Jolie , Rambouillet , and Saint-Germain-en-Laye , important cities include Conflans-Sainte-Honorine , Poissy , Les Mureaux , Houilles , Plaisir , Sartrouville , Chatou , Le Chesnay , and the new agglomeration community of Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines . As of 2019, there are 21 communes with more than 20,000 inhabitants. The 10 most populous communes are: [ 4 ] Commune Population (2019) Versailles 84,808 Sartrouville 52,774 Saint-Germain-en-Laye 44,806 Mantes-la-Jolie 43,921 Poissy 39,187 Conflans-Sainte-Honorine 35,536 Les Mureaux 33,203 Houilles 32,801 Trappes 32,645 Montigny-le-Bretonneux 32,282 Demographics [ edit ] In French, a man from the Yvelines is called Yvelinois (plural Yvelinois ); a woman is Yvelinoise (plural Yvelinoises ).

A foreign country is understood as a country not part of France in 1999, so a person born for example in 1950 in Algeria, when Algeria was an integral part of France, is nonetheless listed as a person born in a foreign country in French statistics. 2 An immigrant is a person born in a foreign country not having French citizenship at birth. An immigrant may have acquired French citizenship since moving to France, but is still considered an immigrant in French statistics. On the other hand, persons born in France with foreign citizenship (the children of immigrants) are not listed as immigrants.
