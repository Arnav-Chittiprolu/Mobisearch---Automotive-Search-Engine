It was produced between 2008 and 2017 as the successor to the previous C209/A209 CLK-Class . [ 3 ] [ 4 ] The body styles of the range are 2-door coupé (C207) and 2-door convertible (A207). The coupé and cabriolet vehicles were never offered in the high-performance Mercedes-AMG variants, unlike its predecessor. [ 5 ] E350 and E400 coupé models were also available in all-wheel drive 4MATIC variants from 2012. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] It was replaced by the C238/A238 E-Class in 2017 for the 2018 model year. [ 8 ] Development and launch [ edit ] The C207/A207 E-Class shares its platform with the W204 C-Class sedan, featuring identical wheelbases , and similar axle track lengths. [ 9 ] While the W212 E-Class sedan is built at the Sindelfingen plant, the E-Class C207 coupé is built in Bremen alongside the W204 C-Class. [ 10 ] Some early petrol models had CGI BlueEFFICIENCY branding, with the exception of the E 300 BlueEFFICIENCY and E 500. [ 11 ] With the introduction of the Mercedes 7G-Tronic automatic transmission, [ 12 ] models subsequently dropped the CGI moniker, along with the BlueEFFICIENCY name after the 2013 facelift. [ 13 ] Diesel models with the nine-speed automatic transmission were also called BlueTEC instead of CDI BlueEFFICIENCY, [ 14 ] and facelifted models were simply called CDI or BlueTEC. [ 13 ] Mercedes-Benz originally intended for the C207/A207 to continue the CLK name, but changed to E-Class branding during development. [ 15 ] Body styles [ edit ] C207 coupé A207 convertible Coupé (C207) [ edit ] The coupé was introduced at the 2009 Geneva Motor Show . [ 16 ] Like the CLK it replaced, the C207 Coupé features a pillarless design with no B pillar between the front and back windows. Convertible (A207) [ edit ] The convertible was unveiled at the 2010 North American International Auto Show . [ 17 ] Some convertibles have Mercedes' AIRSCARF system, which provides neck heating for front occupants, [ 18 ] and the AIRCAP windshield spoiler and wind deflector system, deflecting air over the cabin for reduced draft and wind noise. [ 19 ] Equipment [ edit ] Interior (facelift model) Standard equipment includes Mercedes' AGILITY CONTROL semi-adaptive suspension [ 20 ] and ATTENTION ASSIST which alerts the driver when the car detects driver fatigue. [ 21 ] Models feature front, side, and knee airbags, along with belt tensioners and head restraints. [ 22 ] An AMG Sports package can also be optioned, featuring AMG bodystyling, 15 mm (0.6 in) lower suspension, silver painted front brake calipers, and wider 18-inch alloy wheels. However, the AMG package did not include performance upgrades.
