From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Electric Class 8 semi-trailer truck Motor vehicle Tesla Semi Tesla Semi operated by PepsiCo in Sacramento , California, October 2023. This is one of the units that were first delivered in December 2022. Overview Manufacturer Tesla, Inc. Production 2022–present Assembly United States: Storey County, Nevada ( Gigafactory Nevada ) Body and chassis Class Semi-trailer truck ( Class 8 ) Body style Tractor unit Powertrain Propulsion 3 electric motors Battery ~900 kWh, 1,000 V [ 1 ] Electric range 500 mi (800 km) Plug-in charging 1 MW DC [ 1 ] The Tesla Semi is a battery electric semi-trailer truck built by Tesla, Inc. since 2022. The truck is powered by three motors, and according to Tesla has approximately three times the power of a typical diesel semi truck, a range of 500 miles (800 km), and can operate at an energy use of less than two kilowatt-hours per mile (1.2 kW⋅h/km). [ 2 ] Two concept vehicles were unveiled in November 2017. Tesla CEO Elon Musk originally stated that production would begin in 2019. [ 3 ] Production began in October 2022, several years behind schedule, [ 4 ] and initial deliveries were made to PepsiCo on December 1, 2022. [ 5 ] However, production then stalled. [ 6 ] Volume production of the Semi is planned to begin by March 2026. Once complete, the manufacturing facility, located adjacent to the existing Giga Nevada facility, is planned to produce 50,000 Semi trucks annually. The volume production Semi is expected by Tesla to weigh the same as a comparable diesel truck. [ 7 ] History [ edit ] The Semi was first mentioned in the Tesla 2016 Master Plan for J.B Hunt. [ 8 ] Tesla said at the time that they have a working prototype that uses 'a bunch' of Tesla Model 3 electric motors. [ 9 ] As of April 2017 [update] , Jerome Guillen had been leading the Tesla Semi program. Guillen was once in charge of Freightliner's Cascadia Diesel-engine Class 8 semi , before joining Tesla to configure the Model S production line, [ 10 ] [ 11 ] but left the Semi program a year later to lead one of the Model 3 general assembly lines [ 12 ] and subsequently became Tesla president of automotive in September 2018. [ 13 ] The current lead for the Semi program is Dan Priestly, a Tesla engineer since 2015. [ 14 ] A concept prototype of the Semi was unveiled at a press conference on November 16, 2017, where Elon Musk provided additional specifics. He claimed that the electric Semi would cost 20 ¢/mi (12 ¢/km) less to operate than a diesel truck if charged at a Megacharger , which Tesla said in 2017 they could guarantee a price of 7 ¢/kWh (in the United States). [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Two prototype Tesla Semis in Rocklin, California Tesla indicated that the Semi would be equipped with Enhanced Autopilot as standard equipment, offering semi-autonomous capability, [ 17 ] and that new technology with active safety controls on the independent motors and wheels would detect and prevent jackknifing . [ 16 ] Musk said that the system could eventually allow several units to operate in an autopilot-based convoy, led by a truck with a driver, that would be a cheaper alternative to rail transport. [ 18 ] At the time, platooning was legal in only eight U.S. states and all required a human driver in each truck, so changes in legislation would be necessary to achieve that technology capability. [ 18 ] The battery packs are located under the floor of the cab, between the front and driving wheels. [ 19 ] Running empty, the long-range Tesla Semi was expected to have a range of 620 miles (997 km). [ 20 ] In 2017, Tesla projected that the price of production versions for the 300-mile (480 km) and 500-mile (800 km) range versions would be US$150,000 and US$180,000 respectively. The company stated they would offer a Founder's Series Semi at US$200,000 . [ 21 ] [ needs update ] At the Semi and Roadster unveiling event, Musk stated "Production [of the semi] begins in 2019, so if you order now, you get the truck in 2 years." Tesla intends to warrant the drivetrain for 1 million miles. [ 22 ] In 2018, Tesla announced that Semi prototypes were being tested with real cargo, hauling battery packs from Nevada to California. [ 23 ] [ 24 ] [ 25 ] Company plans to put the Semi into production were substantially delayed. At the 2017 unveiling, production was slated to begin in 2019. [ 22 ] In January 2020, Musk stated that a lack of battery production capability was one limiting factor for the conservative Semi production timeline, with the company choosing to use battery supply for passenger cars instead. [ 26 ] [ 27 ] In January 2021, the company announced that Semi production would be delayed until the end of 2021, [ 28 ] as the company hoped to ramp up high-volume production of its "tabless" 4680 battery cells [ 29 ] (previewed in September 2020) to meet the demand for the Semi and other vehicles. In October 2021, Musk announced that the production of the Semi would slip into 2023. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] [ 32 ] In October 2022, Musk announced on Twitter the start of production of the 500-mile (800 km) range model that would be delivered in December. [ 33 ] In November 2022, the company reported that a Tesla Semi had completed a 500-mile (800 km) drive while weighing 81,000 pounds (37,000 kg). [ 34 ] [ 35 ] On December 1, 2022, Tesla began customer deliveries at an evening event hosted at the manufacturing facility in Nevada. PepsiCo received the first Semis of their large order for use with Pepsi beverage and Frito-Lay snack food transportation fleets. [ 5 ] PepsiCo Vice President Mike O'Connell stated that the Semis can haul Frito-Lay food products for around 425 miles (684 km), but for heavier loads of sodas, the trucks will make shorter trips of around 100 miles (160 km). [ 36 ] In late 2023, Tesla announced plans to establish a charging network for the Semi in the southwestern US. The network is expected to cost as much as $100M. [ 37 ] As of May 2024, Walmart , Costco , Sysco , Martin Brower , and US Foods were also testing the Semi. [ 38 ] In August 2024, third-party logistics provider NFI tested the Semi and reported an efficiency of 1.64 kWh/mi (1.02 kW⋅h/km). [ 39 ] In October 2024, DHL reported an efficiency of 1.72 kWh/mi (1.07 kW⋅h/km) loaded with 75,000 pounds (34,000 kg) gross-combined weight over 388 miles (625 km) on a single charge. [ 40 ] On August 19, 2024, a Tesla Semi caught fire after a crash in Placer County , California, which closed I-80 for sixteen hours. [ 41 ] It took 50,000 US gal (190,000 L) of water to extinguish the fire. [ 42 ] Design [ edit ] Cabin of a Semi prototype Tesla Semi is powered by three carbon-fiber wrapped motors; one operates continuously at optimal efficiency, while the other two motors provide additional power for acceleration and hills. [ 2 ] The Semi's aerodynamic design is inspired by the Japanese bullet trains . [ 43 ] The driver's seat is centered in the cab. The ceiling allows an adult to stand up. Touchscreen displays are set on both sides of the steering wheel, with no other instrument panels. [ 44 ] It includes the same camera set as Tesla's passenger vehicles. Tesla claims that its safety system can prevent jackknifing . [ 16 ] [ better source needed ] Tesla Semi has a 1,000 volt powertrain and charging system, an increase from Tesla's standard 400 volt system, but a capability Tesla also intends to extend to the Cybertruck . [ 2 ] Charging will be supported at a new generation of Tesla vehicle charging infrastructure called the Tesla Megacharger . The Semi's turning radius is comparable to that of Model Y and Model 3, according to Tesla.
