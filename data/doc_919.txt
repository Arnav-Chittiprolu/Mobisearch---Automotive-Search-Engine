Presented in March 2019 as the company's fifth production model, the Model Y is the best-selling electric vehicle of all time, having sold more than 2.16 million units worldwide. [ 6 ] After its 2019 introduction, the Model Y started production at the Tesla Fremont Factory in California, US in January 2020. [ 7 ] Production at Giga Shanghai , China was added in December 2020, and at Gigafactory Texas , US since late 2021. [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Deliveries from Gigafactory Berlin-Brandenburg , Germany started in March 2022. [ 10 ] The Model Y is based on the Model 3 sedan and serves as a larger variant, with around 76 percent of parts being shared between the two and identical exterior and interior styling. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] While most Model Y are configured with two-row seating, in the US the Model Y offered optional third-row seats for a seven-passenger seating capacity until the 2025 refresh. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In 2023, Tesla delivered 1.2 million Model Ys, making it the world's best-selling vehicle that year, surpassing the Toyota Corolla and becoming the first electric vehicle to claim that title. [ 15 ] In 2024 sales were second to the Toyota RAV4 . [ 16 ] A refreshed version of the Model Y was revealed in January 2025, with upgrades similar to the upgraded Model 3. [ 17 ] In mid-2025, Tesla unveiled and released the Model Y L, a long-wheelbase, six-seat variant of the Model Y. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] History Pre-launch Pre-2024 Tesla Model 3 (left) and Pre-2025 Tesla Model Y (right) side by side In 2013, Tesla Motors filed to trademark the name "Model Y". [ 20 ] Later in 2015, CEO Elon Musk teased a Model 3-based Model Y with falcon-wing doors . [ 21 ] In 2017, a Model Y silhouette was teased to Tesla shareholders at the annual general meeting in June. [ 22 ] Musk also announced that the Model Y would be produced in a new factory, as the Fremont plant would not have room to accommodate another production line. [ 23 ] In June 2018, a new silhouette was revealed by Musk. [ 24 ] He stated that the Model Y would be formally announced in March 2019. [ 25 ] The Model Y announcement had been planned for 2018; however, production problems with the Model 3 resulted in it being pushed to 2019. [ 26 ] In October 2018, Elon Musk revealed that he had approved the finalized design for the first production version of the Model Y, however production would not start until 2020. [ 27 ] On March 3, 2019, Elon Musk published multiple tweets, announcing the unveiling event and confirming some specifications. [ 28 ] Musk confirmed the vehicle would use standard doors, as opposed to the falcon-wing doors used on the Model X. [ 29 ] Production Year Model 3/Y vehicles delivered 2020 [ 30 ] 442,511 2021 [ 31 ] 911,208 2022 [ 32 ] 1,247,146 2023 [ 33 ] 1,739,707 2024 [ 34 ] 1,704,093 Tesla originally announced plans at the unveil to assemble the Model Y at Giga Nevada (in Sparks, Nevada), along with the battery and drivetrain for the vehicles, unlike the Model 3, where drivetrains and batteries are assembled at Giga Nevada, with final assembly completed at the Tesla Factory in Fremont, California . Two months later, in May 2019, Tesla said that they instead planned to shuffle production lines at the Tesla Fremont Factory to make space for Model Y production. [ 35 ] [ 36 ] On January 29, 2020, Tesla reported in its Q4 2019 earnings report that Model Y production had already started in the Fremont factory, that one can now place an order for their premium versions with all-wheel drive, and that delivery of Model Y would begin in Q1 2020. [ 37 ] In November 2019, Tesla announced that the Tesla Model Y would be the first vehicle to be assembled at the first European Gigafactory, Giga Berlin . [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Tesla started deliveries of the Berlin-made Model Y since March 2022, mainly for European markets. [ 10 ] United States deliveries started in March 2020 for the Long Range AWD version and the Performance version. Later in 2020, Tesla began shipping cars to the Canadian and Mexican markets. Initial production of the made-in-China Model Y began in mid-December 2020 with 250,000 Model Y expected to be produced in 2021 in China alone. [ 9 ] [ 40 ] In November 2020, Tesla signed an agreement with LG Chem to supply battery cells for Model Y production in China. [ 41 ] On October 7, 2020, Musk tweeted that Giga Berlin Model Y would get single-piece rear and front frame cast, structural battery pack, and new 4680 cells. [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Vehicles manufactured from April 2021 no longer include radar for adaptive cruise control, [ 44 ] and those from May the same year lack lumbar support on passenger seats. [ 45 ] [ 46 ] Model Y vehicles produced from October 2022 no longer include ultrasonic sensors. As a result, the vehicles now rely solely on cameras to provide driver assistance features. [ 47 ] Design Rear view (2020–2025) Model Y Performance (2020–2025) The Tesla Model Y featured a streamlined crossover design derived from the Model 3 sedan, adopting similar proportions and surface treatment while integrating a higher roofline and hatchback-style tailgate. [ 48 ] The overall form emphasized aerodynamics, achieving a drag coefficient of 0.23, with smooth body surfacing and mechanical flush door handles. At the front, the Model Y retained the brand's grilleless fascia, with narrow LED headlamps and a sculpted bumper forming a continuous curve into the front fenders. The roofline followed a fastback silhouette tapering toward a short rear overhang, visually aligning the Model Y closer to a coupe SUV profile rather than a traditional SUV. [ 49 ] The rear design incorporated a full-width tailgate with integrated LED taillights and a discreet lip spoiler on the liftgate edge. A black plastic lower diffuser contrasted the body color was added to reduce perceived height. [ 48 ] The Model Y shares approximately 75% of its components with the Model 3 sedan, enabling streamlined production and reduced manufacturing costs. CEO Elon Musk stated that the high degree of component commonality with the Model 3 facilitates faster production scaling. [ 50 ] [ 51 ] Technical details Heat pump The Model Y is Tesla's first vehicle to use a heat pump instead of electric resistance for interior cabin heating. [ 52 ] [ 53 ] Electric cars using electric resistance heating can lose 40% or more of their range in ambient temperatures below 20 °F (−7 °C). [ 54 ] [ 55 ] The heat pump can be up to 300% more efficient than electric resistance heating. [ 56 ] Some electric vehicles from other manufacturers, including the Nissan Leaf , Renault Zoe , BMW i3 , Jaguar I-Pace , Audi e-tron , and Kia Niro , had already implemented heat pumps. [ 57 ] Tesla's heat pump has been praised for using far fewer parts. [ 58 ] Tesla's heat pump system includes unique features including the "Super Manifold" and the "Octovalve". Inside the Super Manifold two systems meet: one for water- glycol coolant (used for managing the temperature of the battery, computers and powertrain) and the other for R1234YF refrigerant (used for cabin temperature control). The two systems share a liquid cooled condenser and a chiller. The Octovalve has eight ports that move the coolant around the different systems of the vehicle. [ 59 ] [ 60 ] [ 61 ] The system allows the vehicle to remove waste heat from the vehicle's systems and use it to warm the cabin. Musk has said that the new heat pump system is one of the two most significant changes in the Model Y over the Model 3 (which included it too in 2021), [ 62 ] the other being the new single-piece castings. [ 63 ] Radar Vehicles produced since May 2021 lack radar for adaptive cruise control . [ 64 ] In February 2022, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration opened an investigation over phantom braking in these new vehicles. [ 65 ] As of May 2024, the investigation is still ongoing. [ 66 ] Software update 2022.20.9 transitioned radar equipped Model Ys (and Model 3s) to Tesla Vision. [ 67 ] Steering assist is limited to 85 mph (137 km/h), down from 90 mph (140 km/h) on vehicles with radar and minimum following distance has been increased to two car lengths from one. [ original research? ] Single-piece castings See also: Giga Press In August 2020, it was reported that the Tesla Factory in Fremont would soon activate the world's largest unibody casting machine for Model Y production, switching to casting the rear body in a single piece. [ 68 ] Elon Musk told an interviewer that the Berlin-made Model Y is "not just a copy of the Model Y. It's actually a radical redesign of the core technology of building a car." [ 69 ] With this new design and production method, rear and front portions of the frame will be a single-cast design. Injecting molten aluminum into a cast and having robots pull out the molded metal allowed Tesla to combine several manufacturing steps. [ 70 ] This manufacturing process is expected to result in significant cost savings, reducing a complex structural frame of dozens of parts, requiring many hours of welding to be reduced to just 1 part. Other savings include lower tool investments, reduced production time, lower number of robots, and a smaller production area. [ 71 ] In August 2020, Tesla started assembling the world's biggest casting machine for this purpose, which the company called the Giga Press . The machine was supplied by Italian company Idra . [ 72 ] [ 73 ] Production of the Model Y with single-piece rear casting was reported to have started in late December 2020. The new process unified 70 different metal parts into two large parts. [ 74 ] In May 2024, Reuters reported that Tesla had abandoned its plans to adopt the one-piece gigacasting process, due to large upfront investment costs and a larger strategic realignment towards autonomous driving and the Tesla Robotaxi . [ 75 ] 2025 refresh Model Y Premium (originally Long Range) 2025 refresh (Europe) On January 10, 2025, Tesla launched a refreshed Long Range version of the Model Y. Internally codenamed "Juniper", [ 76 ] the new Model Y features a full-width light bar as its daytime running lights and tail light, as well as a touchscreen for passengers in the rear seat. Top speed of the non-performance versions was reduced from 135 to 125 mph (217 to 201 km/h). [ 77 ] The long range version also increased the range from 428 to 447 miles (688 to 719 km). [ 78 ] As customers of other models complained about the lack of the turn signal stalk, the 2025 Model Y refresh keeps the traditional turn signal stalk. [ 79 ] Changes to the exterior of the new Model Y include a sleeker front design with a more streamlined nose and a thin light bar across the hood. Technical revisions include redesigned wheels and rear diffuser to reduce drag and to "optimise lift balance" between the front and rear wheels for less noise and improved stability at high speeds. [ 80 ] Its cabin adopts design cues from the updated Model 3, including wraparound ambient lighting, a 15.4-inch central touchscreen, ventilated seats, and an 8-inch rear touchscreen for second-row passengers. It also received upgrades such as powered rear seats and improved suspension for a more comfortable ride. [ 80 ] Cabin refinement has also been improved with double-layer acoustic glass applied to all windows, while the panoramic glass roof features a silver coating that limits UV and heat transmission into the interior. [ 81 ] A limited-run Launch Series was also introduced to mark the start of production for the refreshed Model Y. This special edition is distinguished by a Launch Series badge on the rear liftgate, a puddle lamp logo, and Launch Series wordmarks applied to the doorsill plates and device charging console. For units specified with the black interior, the cabin also features vegan suede upholstery. [ 81 ] On January 23, 2025, Tesla revealed that its updated Model Y SUV will be available in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico starting in March, with a starting price of approximately US$60,000 . This "Launch Series" special edition includes a 320-mile range battery and Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance technology, “Full Self-Driving (Supervised),” which is typically a $8,000 upgrade. In comparison, the older Model Y begins at $44,990 with a 337-mile (542 km) range for its rear-wheel drive variant. [ 80 ] In China, deliveries began in February 2025. [ 82 ] It was rebranded as the Model Y Premium in North America in October 2025 after the introduction of the Model Y Standard. [ 83 ] Model Y L Model Y L (China) In June 2025, Tesla introduced the three-row, six-seater version of the Model Y, marketed as the Model Y L. [ 84 ] Debuting in China and produced at Gigafactory Shanghai, the variant introduces a six-seat configuration with a lengthened cabin and upgraded interior features. It is equipped with 19-inch aero wheels in a new design and offers a new exterior colour option called Cosmic Silver. Deliveries in China commenced on September 2, 2025. [ 85 ] The Model Y L measures 195.9 in (4,976 mm) in length, 78.0 in (1,982 mm) in width, 65.7 in (1,668 mm) in height, and has a 119.7 in (3,040 mm) wheelbase. Compared with the standard Model Y, it is 7.0 in (179 mm) longer and 1.7 in (44 mm) taller, with most of the added length contributing to a longer wheelbase. The redesigned roofline and rear spoiler result in a drag coefficient of 0.216. The curb weight of the Model Y L is 4,603 pounds (2,088 kg), which is 212 lb (96 kg) more than the dual-motor AWD version of the standard Model Y. [ 86 ] Its cabin adopts a 2-2-2 seating layout, replacing the second-row bench with two captain chairs and adding a 50:50 split-folding third row. The captain chairs feature heating, ventilation, and power reclining functions. Cargo capacity increases to 2,539 litres, compared with 2,130 litres for the standard version. The dashboard layout is largely identical to the standard Model Y, with minor revisions such as a larger 16-inch central touchscreen display (previously 15.4 inches). The upgraded wireless charging pad supports simultaneous fast charging up to 50W and 30W. The audio system includes 19 speakers, a subwoofer, and two additional overhead speakers. Each seating row is equipped with charging ports, and the front seats gain extendable under-thigh support. Power is supplied by a dual-motor all-wheel-drive system paired with an 82 kWh nickel cobalt manganese (NCM) lithium-ion battery supplied by LG Energy Solution . [ 86 ] The front motor produces 191 hp (142 kW), while the rear motor delivers 266 hp (198 kW). Tesla claims a 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) acceleration time of 4.5 seconds, and a CLTC -rated range of 467 miles (751 km). [ 87 ] As of mid-2025, Tesla has not confirmed whether the Model Y L will be produced outside of China. [ 86 ] [ 88 ] Model Y Performance 2025 Model Y Performance The refreshed Model Y Performance debuted in August 2025, as the top-spec variant of the normal wheelbase Model Y lineup, initially for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. [ 89 ] The North American market model was introduced in October 2025. [ 90 ] The updated Model Y Performance shares several components with the updated Model 3 Performance, while featuring notable upgrades in powertrain and chassis tuning. It gains new front and rear bumpers, a carbon fiber rear spoiler, and other tweaks that together yield 10% less drag and 64% reduced lift, improving front-to-rear balance by 27% over the previous model. Additional exterior highlights include gloss black trim, red brake calipers, 21-inch Arachnid 2.0 forged wheels, and a rear badge with Performance puddle lamps. [ 91 ] It has 5.94 inches (151 mm) ground clearance, 0.63 inches (16 mm) lower than the Long Range AWD model. It weighs 4,482 pounds (2,033 kg), which is 79 pounds (36 kg) more than the dual-motor Long Range variant. [ 92 ] The Model Y Performance uses Tesla's Performance 4DU dual-motor system, producing 460 hp (340 kW). It accelerates from 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) in 3.5 seconds and reaches a top speed of 155 mph (250 km/h). For comparison, the Long Range AWD variant requires 4.8 seconds and tops out at 125 mph (201 km/h). The increased performance comes with a slightly reduced WLTP range of 360 miles (580 km), compared to 373 miles (600 km) on the Long Range AWD. [ 93 ] The updated Performance variant is equipped with a new high-density battery pack, marketed as the 5M battery supplied by LG Energy Solution with around 82 to 84 kWh of usable energy that maintains the same weight as the standard version. [ 93 ] It also adopts the adaptive damping system from the Model 3 Performance, combined with revised springs, roll bars, bushings, and a stiffer rear body structure for improved torsional rigidity. It also retains the ability to tow up to 3,500 pounds with its included towing package and class II tow bar. [ 90 ] Drivers are able to select between Standard and Sport settings for the adaptive suspension , while the stability assist system offers Standard and Reduced modes. The latter reduces traction control interventions but retains essential stability safeguards. The cabin of the updated Model Y Performance features aluminum pedals, carbon-fiber dashboard and door trims, and Performance-specific front seats with ventilation, heating, and power-adjustable thigh support. The central touchscreen display is enlarged to 16 inches (up from 15.4 inches), matching the unit in the long-wheelbase Model Y L, and offers 80% more pixels than before. [ 94 ] The updated Model Y Performance became the first Model Y to feature vehicle-to-load (V2L) and vehicle-to-home (V2H) bi-directional charging. [ 90 ] Model Y Standard Tesla Model Y Standard In October 2025, Tesla released the cheapest version of the Model Y called the Model Y Standard, initially for the North American market with rear wheel drive only. The existing Long Range trims were rebranded as the "Premium" trims. Changes and equipment reductions include simplified front end design without the lightbar, smaller 18-inch wheels with simpler designs, simpler taillights without the connecting lightbar piece, half-textile upholstery replacing leather seat, redesigned center console, reduced speaker count from 15 to 7, a smaller frunk without a drain plug and an indirect tire-pressure monitoring system . [ 95 ] Removed features include the FM / AM radio, interior ambient lighting, power folding mirrors, front ventilated seats, rear heated seats, power adjustment for rear seats and steering wheel, HEPA filter and the rear seat infotainment screen. Tesla Autopilot is limited to traffic aware cruise control without autosteering. The maximum charging speed is reduced to 225 kW from 250 kW on the Performance and Premium trims. The trim also uses passive shock absorbers instead of the frequency-dependent units fitted to other models. [ 96 ] Available paint colors are gray, black and white. [ 83 ] Instead of replacing the glass roof with a regular metal roof, Tesla opted for the Standard version to be fitted with a headliner with sound deadener to cover the glass roof. [ 96 ] In North America, the Model Y Standard retails for $5,000 less than the Premium RWD trim. [ 97 ] Markets and configurations United States During its introduction, there were four planned powertrain configurations for the Model Y in the U.S., which are Standard Range Rear-Wheel Drive (RWD), Long Range RWD, Long Range with Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive (AWD), and Performance (with Dual Motor All-Wheel Drive). [ 98 ] [ 99 ] However, the Long Range RWD model was not produced until 2024. [ 100 ] Timeline of Tesla Model Y in the U.S. [ 101 ] [ better source needed ] The Standard Range RWD configuration was initially canceled in July 2020 after being listed as to be announced in "spring 2021", due to the range (230 miles or 370 km) being unacceptably low to CEO Elon Musk . [ 102 ] On January 7, 2021, Tesla once again released the Standard Range RWD configuration, alongside the seven-seat option for the Model Y. The Standard Range RWD features 244 miles (393 km) of EPA -estimated range. [ 103 ] [ 104 ] Tesla stopped taking orders for the variant in February 2021, making it the shortest-lived configuration offered for the Model Y. [ 105 ] After reports emerged in February 2021, [ 106 ] on December 6, 2021, Tesla formally notified customers who had pre-ordered the Long Range RWD that their chosen configuration is no longer available in the U.S. According to reports, this configuration was never delivered in the U.S. [ 107 ] On April 9, 2022, Tesla began building the Standard Range AWD configuration. Manufactured at Gigafactory Texas , it was equipped with the new 4680 battery cells and structural battery pack technology rated at 279 miles (449 km) of EPA range. [ 108 ] [ 109 ] At first, this configuration was only available for employees, invited reservation holders, and customers residing in the Texas area. [ 110 ] [ 111 ] Around April 7, 2023, Tesla made the configuration for sale to the general public. [ 112 ] [ 113 ] On September 14, Tesla stopped taking orders for the Standard Range AWD. [ 114 ] On January 12, 2023, Tesla announced a significant price reduction for the Model Y and Model 3. This reduction made the Model Y Long Range eligible for the federal tax credit of $7,500 under the Inflation Reduction Act , which is applicable only for cars that are priced below $55,000. [ 115 ] Tesla reintroduced the Standard Range RWD model to the US market in October 2023. [ 116 ] In May 2024, the Standard Range RWD model was no longer offered for sale and was replaced by a Long Range RWD model. [ 100 ] It was revealed that the Standard Range RWD model vehicles built in 2023 and early 2024 were the same as the new Long Range RWD model, but with the former having a software lock in place to reduce range to 260 miles. Elon Musk announced on social media that owners of the Standard Range RWD model from 2023 and 2024 may be able to pay a fee to unlock additional range, pending regulatory approval. [ 100 ] Canada In April 2023, Tesla began producing made-in-China Model Ys to be sold in Canada. [ 117 ] This allowed more made-in-USA vehicles that qualified for the US federal tax credit to be sold in the US. [ 118 ] Australia Orders for the Model Y in Australia opened on June 10, 2022, with initial configurations offered were RWD and Performance AWD and imported from Gigafactory Shanghai . Deliveries commenced in August 2022. [ 119 ] The Long Range AWD configuration was released on April 4, 2023. [ 120 ] China On June 5, 2020, Tesla launched the Model Y Online design studio for the Chinese market, allowing customers in China to place orders for the upcoming made-in-China Model Y. [ 121 ] First delivery of the model was made on January 18, 2021. [ 122 ] On January 1, 2021, Tesla started selling the Model Y in China, and it sold out its planned production (an unknown quantity) for Q1 2021 within 6 days. [ 123 ] In June 2024, the Jiangsu province government listed the Model Y as being eligible for purchase for government use. It is the first time that a Tesla car entered China's official vehicle procurement catalog. [ 124 ] India On July 15, 2025, Tesla launched the Model Y in India. The units are imported from China.
