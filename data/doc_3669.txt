From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Physical stress on a mechanical system or component Mechanical load is the physical stress on a mechanical system or component [ 1 ] leading to strain .  Loads can be static or dynamic .  Some loads are specified as part of the design criteria of a mechanical system. Depending on the usage, some mechanical loads can be measured by an appropriate test method in a laboratory or in the field. Vehicle [ edit ] It can  be the external mechanical resistance against which a machine (such as a motor or engine), acts. [ 2 ] The load can often be expressed as a curve of force versus speed. For instance, a given car traveling on a road of a given slope presents a load which the engine must act against. Because air resistance increases with speed, the motor must put out more torque at a higher speed in order to maintain the speed. By shifting to a higher gear, one may be able to meet the requirement with a higher torque and a lower engine speed, whereas shifting to a lower gear has the opposite effect. Accelerating increases the load, whereas decelerating decreases the load. Pump [ edit ] Similarly, the load on a pump depends on the head against which the pump is pumping, and on the size of the pump. Fan [ edit ] Similar considerations apply to a fan .
