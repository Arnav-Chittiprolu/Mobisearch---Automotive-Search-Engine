Often described and marketed as a crossover since its introduction, [ 4 ] [ 5 ] the Soul is a hatchback with a box proportion [ 6 ] [ 7 ] and tall roof, which are designed to maximize its interior space. Despite its SUV -like styling, the Soul was never available with all-wheel drive , instead it is exclusively a front-wheel drive vehicle. [ 8 ] The Soul first appeared in 2006 in the form of a concept model displayed at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The production model made its debut at the Paris Motor Show in 2008. During its introduction, Kia stated that the Soul is aimed at the North American market, and targeted towards buyers in the 18 to 35-year old range. [ 9 ] The second-generation model was introduced in 2013 for the 2014 model year, which featured a larger exterior and interior dimensions along with a reworked chassis , while keeping its boxy styling. [ 10 ] The Soul is currently in its third generation, which was introduced in 2018 for the 2019 model year. [ 3 ] Since 2014, Kia has also marketed a battery electric variant as the Soul EV . The name "Soul" comes from the homophone of Seoul , the city that hosts Kia's headquarters. [ 9 ] On October 6, 2025, Kia announced that production of the Soul will end later that month.

Designed at Kia's design center in California , the Soul concept was styled by Mike Torpey in early 2005 under the leadership of Chief Design Officer Peter Schreyer . [ 9 ] As a new member of Kia's Design Team in Irvine, California, Torpey was sent to Kia Korea to brainstorm a new vehicle. After seeing a television documentary on wild boars and learning of their importance in Korean culture, Torpey sketched a caricature of a boar wearing a backpack. The New York Times reported "the boar's attitude of strength and capability was the image [Torpey] wanted for a new model aimed at hip urban youths." [ 14 ] According to the Automotive News, the Soul had been criticized for a "plasticky" interior and a harsh ride. [ 15 ] Both the ride quality and interior were upgraded during the first year of production. [ citation needed ] Rear (pre-facelift) Interior Features [ edit ] The interior features two front bucket seats and a rear flat-folding bench seat that can adjust to prioritize passenger or cargo volume. [ 16 ] The first generation was marketed with a six-speaker stereo system that includes a CD player, a USB port for iPod connection, and Sirius Satellite Radio . Additional features available for upgrade included additional speakers, steering-wheel-mounted audio controls and Bluetooth for hands-free connectivity. [ 17 ] Options included themed special editions as well as 18-inch alloy wheels, cruise control, leather-wrapped steering wheel, racing stripes, "dragon" and " houndstooth " graphics, and LED turn indicators.

For model year 2012, the Soul received revised exterior and interior styling and new powertrains. In North America the updated 1.6 liter engine, featuring direct injection, makes 138 hp (103 kW) and 123 lb⋅ft (167 N⋅m); the 2.0 liter engine makes 164 hp (122 kW) and 148 lb⋅ft (201 N⋅m) of torque. The 1.6 now delivers 9.4–9.0 L/100 km; 30–31 mpg ‑imp (25–26 mpg ‑US ) in the city and 7.8–7.6 L/100 km; 36–37 mpg ‑imp (30–31 mpg ‑US ) on the highway. The 2.0 returns 10.2–9.8 L/100 km; 28–29 mpg ‑imp (23–24 mpg ‑US ) in the city and 8.4–8.1 L/100 km; 34–35 mpg ‑imp (28–29 mpg ‑US ) on the highway. [ 18 ] New features included navigation, UVO infotainment, leather and heated seats and automatic climate control.

As a result, the gasoline offers a 10 kW (14 bhp) increase in power compared to its predecessor, while returning improved fuel economy. The modified 1.6 CRDi diesel returns 4.90 L/100 km; 48.0 mpg ‑US (57.6 mpg ‑imp ) and has cut its CO 2 emissions from 138  g/km to 129g/km – particularly important for the European market where taxation is based on carbon emissions. [ 20 ] The 2013 North American Soul received upgrades including 3 new colors, a bulged hood, revised grille with black chrome accents, LED red tail lights, LED amber front turn signals under the headlights and white LED running lights under the front turn signals.
