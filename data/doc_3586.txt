In 1983, a four-wheel electronic "[[Anti-lock braking system|Anti-Skid Control]]" system was introduced on the [[Toyota Crown]].<ref name="toyota-global.com">http://www.toyota-global.com/company/history_of_toyota/75years/data/automotive_business/products_technology/technology_development/chassis/index.html 75 Years of Toyota: Chassis</ref> In 1987, [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[BMW]] and Toyota<ref name="toyota-global.com" /> introduced their first [[traction control system]]s. Traction control works by applying individual wheel braking and throttle to maintain traction under acceleration, but unlike ESC, it is not designed to aid in steering.

In 1990, Mitsubishi released the [[Mitsubishi Diamante|Diamante]] in Japan. Developed to help the driver maintain the intended line through a corner; an onboard computer monitored several vehicle operating parameters through various sensors. When too much [[throttle]] had been used when taking a curve, engine output and braking were automatically regulated to ensure the proper line through a curve and to provide the proper amount of traction under various road surface conditions. While conventional traction control systems at the time featured only a slip control function, Mitsubishi's TCL system had an active safety function, which improved course tracing performance by automatically adjusting the traction force (called "trace control"), thereby restraining the development of excessive lateral acceleration while turning. Although not a 'proper' modern stability control system, trace control monitors steering angle, throttle position and individual wheel speeds, although there is no [[Yaw angle|yaw]] input. The TCL system's standard wheel slip control function enabled better traction on slippery surfaces or during cornering. In addition to the system's individual effect, it also worked together with the Diamante's electronically controlled suspension and [[Four wheel steering|four-wheel steering]] to improve total handling and performance.<ref name="80's">{{Cite web|url=http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.za/featuresites/mm_history/1980-1989.asp|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041122100306/http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.za/featuresites/mm_history/1980-1989.asp |title="Mitsubishi Motors history 1981–1990", Mitsubishi Motors South Africa website|archive-date=November 22, 2004}}</ref><ref name="tcl">[http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.za/featuresites/mm_history/TCL.asp "Control Technology"], Mitsubishi Motors South Africa website {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030074242/http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.za/featuresites/mm_history/TCL.asp |date=October 30, 2007 }}</ref><ref name="sigma">[http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.za/featuresites/mm_history/Sigma.asp "Mitsubishi Diamante"], Mitsubishi Motors South Africa website {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926091112/http://www.mitsubishi-motors.co.za/featuresites/mm_history/Sigma.asp |date=September 26, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="astc">[http://www.mitsubishi-motors.com/corporate/about_us/technology/safety/e/astc.html "Stability Control"], Mitsubishi Motors website {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723113045/http://www.mitsubishi-motors.com/corporate/about_us/technology/safety/e/astc.html |date=July 23, 2008 }}</ref><ref name="tclpaper">[http://www.sae.org/technical/papers/912583 "Traction Control System for Improved Driving Safety"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080328133247/http://www.sae.org/technical/papers/912583 |date=2008-03-28 }}, SAE Technical Papers</ref><ref name="diamantereview">[http://research.cars.com/go/crp/research.jsp?section=reviews&crpPage=reviews.jsp&makeid=34&modelid=309&year=1992&myid=&acode=&mode=&aff=national "1992 Mitsubishi Diamante"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927025652/http://research.cars.com/go/crp/research.jsp?section=reviews&crpPage=reviews.jsp&makeid=34&modelid=309&year=1992&myid=&acode=&mode=&aff=national |date=2007-09-27 }}, by Tom Incantalupo, Newsday, October 1991</ref><ref name="stability control">[http://autospeed.drive.com.au/A_2919/cms/article.html "Electronic Stability Control - Part 1"], by Michael Knowling, autospeed, May 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070708035016/http://autospeed.drive.com.au/A_2919/cms/article.html |date=July 8, 2007 }}</ref>

BMW, working with [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]] and [[Continental Automotive Systems|Continental]], developed a system to reduce engine [[torque]] to prevent loss of control and applied it to most of the BMW model line for 1992, excluding the [[BMW 3 Series (E30)|E30]] and [[BMW 3 Series (E36)|E36]]. This system could be ordered with the winter package, which came with a [[limited-slip differential]], heated seats, and heated mirrors. From 1987 to 1992, Mercedes-Benz and Bosch co-developed a system called ''Elektronisches Stabilitätsprogramm'' ("Electronic Stability Program", trademarked as ESP) to control lateral slippage.

=== Introduction, second generation ===
In 1995, three automobile manufacturers introduced ESC systems. Mercedes-Benz, supplied by Bosch, was the first to implement ESP with their [[Mercedes-Benz C140|Mercedes-Benz S 600 Coupé]].<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.daimler.com/Projects/c2c/channel/documents/1892377_CL_Klasse_e_2010.pdf |title=The CL-Class from Mercedes-Benz |date=July 2010 |access-date=2014-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141230184646/http://www.daimler.com/Projects/c2c/channel/documents/1892377_CL_Klasse_e_2010.pdf |archive-date=2014-12-30 }}</ref> [[Toyota]]'s Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) system appeared on the [[Toyota Crown Majesta#Second-generation series S150|Toyota Crown Majesta]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web |title=Vehicle Stability Control System |url=http://www.jsae.or.jp/autotech/5-13.php |website=JSAE.or.jp |language=ja}}</ref>

[[General Motors]] worked with [[Delphi Automotive]] and introduced its version of ESC, called "StabiliTrak", in 1996 for the 1997 model year on select [[Cadillac]] models.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cars.com/reviews/detroit-newspaperss-view-1420689173171/ |title=1997 Cadillac DeVille - Detroit Newspapers Review |website=Cars.com |access-date=2018-10-04 }}</ref> StabiliTrak was made standard equipment on all GM SUVs and vans sold in the U.S. and Canada by 2007, except for certain commercial and fleet vehicles. While the StabiliTrak name is used on most General Motors vehicles for the U.S. market, "Electronic Stability Control" is used for GM's overseas brands, such as Opel, Holden and [[Saab Automobile|Saab]], except in the cases of Saab's [[Saab 9-7X|9-7X]] and [[Saab 9-4X|9-4X]] (which also use the StabiliTrak name).

The same year, Cadillac introduced an [[System integration|integrated]] vehicle [[Car handling|handling]] and software control system called the Integrated Chassis Control System (ICCS), on the [[Cadillac Eldorado]]. It involves an omnibus computer integration of engine, traction control, Stabilitrak electronic stability control, [[steering]], and adaptive [[continuously variable road sensing suspension]] (CVRSS), with the intent of improving responsiveness to driver input, performance, and overall safety, similar to Toyota/[[Lexus]] Vehicle Dynamics Integrated Management.

In 1997, [[Audi]] introduced the first series production ESP for [[all-wheel drive]] vehicles ([[Audi A8]] and [[Audi A6]] with quattro (four-wheel drive system)){{Citation needed|date=May 2015}}. In 1998, [[Volvo Cars]] began to offer their version of ESC called Dynamic Stability and Traction Control (DSTC) on the new [[Volvo S80]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.volvoclub.org.uk/press/s80/press/s80press5.shtml |title=Volvo S80 |website=Volvoclub.org.uk |access-date=2017-05-24 }}</ref> Meanwhile, others investigated and developed their own systems.

During a [[moose test]], Swedish journalist Robert Collin of ''[[Teknikens Värld]]'' [[Vehicle rollover|rolled]] a Mercedes [[Mercedes-Benz A-Class#W168|A-Class]] (without ESC) at 78&nbsp;km/h in October 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wwwc.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/0005/11/collin.html|title=Mercedes fryser ut Robert Collin |website=Aftonbladet.se |access-date=2011-11-13 }}</ref> Because Mercedes Benz promoted a reputation for safety, they recalled and retrofitted 130,000 A-Class cars with firmer suspension and sportier tyres; all newly produced A- class featured ESC as standard along with the upgraded suspension and wheels. This produced a significant reduction in crashes, and the number of vehicles with ESC rose. The availability of ESC in small cars like the A-Class ignited a market trend; thus, ESC became available for all models (whether standard or as an option).

[[Ford Motor Company|Ford]]'s version of ESC, called AdvanceTrac, was launched in the year 2000. Ford later added [[Roll Stability Control]] to AdvanceTrac<ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=20679 |title=Ford Media, "Advancetrac With Roll Stability Control – The Ford Advantage" |website=Media.ford.com |access-date=2011-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522154855/http://media.ford.com/article_display.cfm?article_id=20679 |archive-date=2012-05-22 }}</ref><ref name="fordrsc">{{cite web |url=http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/nrd-01/esv/esv20/07-0136-O.pdf |title=Jianbo Lu, Dave Messih, and Albert Salib, "Roll Rate Based Stability Control – The Roll Stability Control System," Proceedings of the 20th Enhanced Safety of Vehicles Conference, 2007 |access-date=2011-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928205247/http://www-nrd.nhtsa.dot.gov/pdf/nrd-01/esv/esv20/07-0136-O.pdf |archive-date=2011-09-28 }}</ref> which was first introduced in the [[Volvo XC90]] in 2003. It has been implemented in many Ford vehicles since.

Ford and Toyota announced that all their North American vehicles would be equipped with ESC standard by the end of 2009 (it was standard on Toyota [[Sport utility vehicle|SUVs]] as of 2004, and after the 2011 model year, all Lexus, Toyota, and [[Scion (automobile)|Scion]] vehicles had ESC; the last one to get it was the 2011 model-year [[Scion tC]]).<ref>[http://media.ford.com/newsroom/release_display.cfm?release=24259 Ford Motor Company – Press Release – FORD TO MAKE ELECTRONIC STABILITY CONTROL STANDARD ON ALL CARS AND TRUCKS BY END OF 2009] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080316231420/http://media.ford.com/newsroom/release_display.cfm?release=24259 |date=March 16, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wheels.ca/article/19503 |title=Imports sweep safety list in U.S |website=Wheels.ca |date=2006-11-25 |access-date=2011-11-13}}</ref> However, as of November 2010, Ford still sold models in North America without ESC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tc.gc.ca/eng/roadsafety/tp-tp14651-vs200701-table_10-752.htm |title=ESC Fitment – Model Year 2010 |website=Tc.gc.ca |date=2010-10-08 |access-date=2011-11-13}}</ref> General Motors had made a similar announcement for the end of 2010.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.technologynewsdaily.com/node/3328 |title=Electronic Stability Control, GM |website=Technologynewsdaily.com |access-date=2011-11-13 |archive-date=2007-01-29 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070129112437/http://www.technologynewsdaily.com/node/3328 }}</ref>

=== Third generation and after ===
In 2003 in Sweden the purchase rate on new cars with ESC was 15%. The Swedish road safety administration issued a strong ESC recommendation and in September 2004, 16 months later, the purchase rate was 58%. A stronger ESC recommendation was then given and in December 2004, the purchase rate on new cars had reached 69%<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vv.se/filer/30825/11_1_antisladdsystem.pdf |title=ESC Effectiveness |website=Vv.se |access-date=2011-11-13 }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and by 2008 it had grown to 96%. ESC advocates around the world are promoting increased ESC use through legislation and public awareness campaigns and by 2012, most new vehicles should be equipped with ESC. {{Update|section|date=December 2022}}

=== Legislation ===
In 2009, the European Union decided to make ESC mandatory.  Since November 1, 2011, EU [[Type Approval|type approval]] is only granted to models equipped with ESC. Since November 1, 2014, ESC has been required on all newly registered cars in the EU.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interregs.com/spotlight.php?id=84 |title=New EC Regulation on General Safety |website=Interregs.com |date=September 2009 |access-date=2014-11-11 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141111090411/http://www.interregs.com/spotlight.php?id=84 |archive-date=2014-11-11 }}</ref>

The [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration|NHTSA]] required all new passenger vehicles sold in the US to be equipped with ESC as of the 2012 model year, and estimated it will prevent 5,300–9,600 annual fatalities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/portal/site/nhtsa/menuitem.012c081c5966f0ca3253ab10cba046a0/ |title=Preliminary Results Analyzing the Effectiveness of Electronic Stability Control (ESC) Systems |website=Nhtsa.dot.gov |access-date=2011-11-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100111175448/http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/portal/site/nhtsa/menuitem.012c081c5966f0ca3253ab10cba046a0 |archive-date=2010-01-11 }}</ref>  {{Update|section|date=December 2022}} Edit summary (Briefly describe your changes) By publishing changes, you agree to the Terms of Use , and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and the GFDL .
