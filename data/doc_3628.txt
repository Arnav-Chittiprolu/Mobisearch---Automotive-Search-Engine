Technology Wikipedia:WikiProject Technology Template:WikiProject Technology Technology Picture [ edit ] I saw the request for an image ( Wikipedia:WikiProject Automobiles/Requested images ) but I am unsure of what to include in the image. I could get a picture of a car lights flashing to as the button on the key is pressed, indicating that the doors are now unlocked. James086 Talk | Contribs 14:52, 18 October 2006 (UTC) [ reply ] Power door locking methods [ edit ] Some older cars, notably the Jaguar XJ6 Series II or higher trim levels of the XE Ford Falcon used a rocker or toggle switch on the console or driver's door armrest to activate the central locking system. This contrasts to the common modern method of one using the key or inside locking button in the driver's door for the same purpose. Such systems appeared to be complicated to operate, with one using separate controls to lock all doors of the vehicle. This method was disapproved of by the motoring press because the driver couldn't just use the key once to make sure all vehicle doors were locked. SimonMackay ( talk ) 03:48, 20 November 2007 (UTC) [ reply ] Central locking is of electrical nature only? [ edit ] I am under the impression that there existed some mechanical central locking systems. If so, shouldn't it be more appropriate to have the article as "central locking" instead or "Power door locks", which limits the range to electrical systems only? -- Dead3y3 ( talk ) 08:38, 30 October 2010 (UTC) [ reply ] External links modified [ edit ] Hello fellow Wikipedians, I have just modified one external link on Power door locks .

[ edit ] Simple descriptions of car locks mention a motor within the lock assembly that locks and unlocks the lock.   But my Volvo V70 has 2 motors within each lock assembly.   What does the other motor do?   Perhaps this very short article can be expanded to include a section about how they work in practice? FreeFlow99 ( talk ) 16:58, 1 July 2020 (UTC) [ reply ] Locking vs unlocking [ edit ] There is a discussion regarding security vs openness that is not adequately addressed in the article. Remote opening/locking vs internal automatic locking are two separate issues. 142.198.229.150 ( talk ) 22:46, 31 December 2024 (UTC) [ reply ] Retrieved from " https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Power_door_locks&oldid=1285632543 " Categories : Start-Class Automobile articles Unknown-importance Automobile articles Start-Class Technology articles WikiProject Technology articles
