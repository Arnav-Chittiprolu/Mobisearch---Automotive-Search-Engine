=== Motor ===
Instead of a traditional [[induction motor]], the Model 3's primary (rear) motor uses [[permanent magnet motor|internal permanent magnets]] (IPM) with [[reluctance motor#Synchronous reluctance|synchronous reluctance motor]] (SynRM) characteristics. Compared to an induction motor, the aluminum [[squirrel-cage rotor]] is replaced by an iron [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]], with slots cut into the metal where magnets are inserted in the internal core. As an IPM motor, it produces excellent starting torque; however, performance declines at high speeds due to [[counter-electromotive force]]s. For high-speed operation, Tesla engineers used iron's reluctance property, which allows it to spin in synchronization with the magnetic field of the [[stator]] if channels are cut into the core. These channels were also an ideal internal location for the permanent magnets to be mounted.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Tesla Model 3's IPM-SynRM electric motor explained |url=https://uk.motor1.com/news/462107/video-tesla-model-3-electric-motor-explained/ |access-date=2024-07-09 |work=Motor1 |language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Gaddam |first=Yogeshwari S. |date=January 8, 2021 |title=Tesla Model 3's IPM-SynRM electric motor |url=https://www.lesics.com/tesla-model-3_s-ipm-synrm-electric-motor.html |access-date=2024-07-09 |website=Lesics}}</ref>

The IPM-SynRM motor is responsible for most of the propulsion in both the RWD and AWD Model 3s. The induction motor on the front axle of the AWD models provides additional power and helps to improve handling.<ref name="govindasamy-20170621">{{Cite report |url=https://iaspub.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=40001&flag=1 |title=Request for issuance of a new certificate of Conformity – Initial application for MY2017 Model 3 - Touring |last1=Govindasamy |first1=Kannan |last2=Tesla |date=June 21, 2017 |publisher=[[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] |quote=HTSLV00.0L13 … L: Lithium Ion Battery; 1 – RWD Motor; 3 – Model 3 Line of vehicles … The motor is a 3‐phase AC internal permanent magnet motor utilizing a six‐pole, high‐frequency design with inverter‐controlled magnetic flux. |access-date=October 26, 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180812030236/https://iaspub.epa.gov/otaqpub/display_file.jsp?docid=40001&flag=1 |archive-date=August 12, 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name="tesla.com 2019">{{Cite web |date=April 23, 2019 |title=The Longest-Range Electric Vehicle Now Goes Even Farther {{!}} Tesla, Inc. |url=https://www.tesla.com/blog/longest-range-electric-vehicle-now-goes-even-farther |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191021100211/https://www.tesla.com/blog/longest-range-electric-vehicle-now-goes-even-farther |archive-date=October 21, 2019 |access-date=October 6, 2019 |website=tesla.com |language=en-US |quote=All Model S and X vehicles now benefit from Tesla's latest generation of drive unit technology, which combines an optimized permanent magnet synchronous reluctance motor, silicon carbide power electronics, and improved lubrication, cooling, bearings, and gear designs to achieve greater than 93% efficiency.

=== Battery ===
For the Model 3, Tesla initially decided to use 2170-type (21&nbsp;mm diameter, 70&nbsp;mm height) cylindrical cells. Compared with the 18650-type batteries that the company had been using since its first generation Roadster, the 2170 batteries were optimized for electric cars, allowing for a higher capacity per cell and a lower number of cells per battery pack.<ref name="Kane 2022" />

For vehicles built at the Tesla Fremont Factory, the company sources 2170-type batteries with a [[Lithium nickel cobalt aluminium oxides|nickel-cobalt-aluminum]] cathode chemistry from [[Panasonic]]'s production line at Gigafactory Nevada.<ref name="Kane 2022" />

For vehicles made at Gigafactory Shanghai, batteries with a [[Lithium nickel manganese cobalt oxides|nickel-cobalt-manganese]] cathode chemistry are sourced from [[LG Energy Solution]]'s factories in China.<ref name="Kane 2022" />

As lower-cost models were introduced, Tesla started using prismatic (rectangular) cells with a [[lithium iron phosphate battery|lithium iron phosphate]] (LFP) chemistry in vehicles produced in both factories.<ref name="Kane 2022">{{Cite web |last=Kane |first=Mark |date=May 23, 2022 |title=What Batteries Are Tesla Using In Its Electric Cars? |url=https://insideevs.com/news/587455/batteries-tesla-using-electric-cars/ |access-date=August 17, 2023 |website=InsideEVs |language=en}}</ref> LFP batteries are less energy-dense (which reduces range), but do not contain any nickel or cobalt, which makes them less expensive to produce.<ref>{{cite web |last=Sanderson |first=Henry |date=February 19, 2020 |title=Tesla's choice of cheaper lithium batteries hits cobalt miners |url=https://www.ft.com/content/7264bdda-5310-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221211231233/https://www.ft.com/content/7264bdda-5310-11ea-90ad-25e377c0ee1f |archive-date=December 11, 2022 |access-date=May 6, 2020 |website=Financial Times}}</ref> Unlike other types, LFP batteries achieve less degradation when being regularly charged to 100 percent.

=== Engineering and changes ===
When production began in 2017, the base Model 3 was announced to have a 50-kWh battery with a range of about {{convert|220|miles|abbr=out}} while the optional 75-kWh battery would have a range of about {{convert|310|miles|abbr=out}}.<ref>{{Cite web |date=August 25, 2017 |title=Take an In-Depth Look at the Tesla Model 3's New Battery Pack Architecture |url=https://futurism.com/take-an-in-depth-look-at-the-tesla-model-3s-new-battery-pack-architecture/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107015125/https://futurism.com/take-an-in-depth-look-at-the-tesla-model-3s-new-battery-pack-architecture/ |archive-date=November 7, 2017 |access-date=November 6, 2017}}</ref>
