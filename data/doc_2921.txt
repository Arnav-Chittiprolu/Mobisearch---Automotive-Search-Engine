[ a ] History [ edit ] Designed by Matthew Murray , and made by Fenton, Murray and Wood of Holbeck , Leeds, it is one of only two of the type to survive; [ 3 ] the other is located at The Henry Ford , Michigan, United States. [ 4 ] The single-cylinder engine was used by John Bradley & Co of Stourbridge from 1805 until 1931, and by N. Hingley & Sons Ltd of Netherton from 1931 until 1961, when it was acquired by Birmingham City Council for their science museum. [ 5 ] Murray patented the hypocycloidal arrangement in 1802.
