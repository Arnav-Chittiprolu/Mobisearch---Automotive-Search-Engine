Roewe vehicles were initially based on technology acquired from defunct British carmaker MG Rover . [ 1 ] SAIC was unable to purchase the rights to the Rover brand name (which was retained by BMW , subsequently sold to Ford and ultimately returned to Jaguar Land Rover ) and created the Roewe marque as a replacement. [ 2 ] Roewe vehicles are sold in most export markets outside China under the MG marque. Name [ edit ] The name Roewe originates from SAIC's failure to acquire the Rover brand name from BMW c. 2005 (it was instead sold to Ford in 2006, [ 3 ] and the brand is currently owned by Jaguar Land Rover ). Composed of the Chinese characters Róng and wēi , which roughly mean "glorious power", the name is a transliteration of Rover , although SAIC has stated that it is derived from Löwe , the German word for lion. [ 4 ] History [ edit ] Roewe W5 SAIC purchased technology relating to the Rover 75 and Rover 25 after the 2005 collapse of MG Rover , and the Roewe marque first appeared on a version of the 75, the Roewe 750 . Originally intending to purchase all assets of the failed British company, SAIC was outbid by Nanjing Automobile . [ 3 ] In 2007, SAIC merged with Nanjing Auto, so it now controls those MG Rover properties, such as the MG name and a Birmingham factory, the Longbridge plant , that it was initially unable to acquire. [ 5 ] English engineering firm Ricardo assisted the development of early Roewe models and set up a new joint venture company in the UK, Ricardo (2010) Consultants Ltd, which helped bring the 750 to market. [ 2 ] According to SAIC, work on the vehicle was also done in China. [ 6 ] In 2007, Ricardo (2010) was purchased by SAIC and renamed SAIC Motor UK Technical Centre. [ 7 ] It employs over 200 British ex-Rover engineers. [ 8 ] The Roewe brand unveiled the Roewe Vision-R electric concept car at the 2015 Guangzhou Auto Show in China that and previews a new generation of the Roewe design language for the Chinese brand, featuring sharp creases and a full-width grille that evolved from the previous Roewe shield grille. The new design theme was applied to products launched shortly after such as the Roewe i5, i6, RX3, RX5, RX7, RX8, and Marvel X, as well as facelifts of the Roewe 950 and Roewe 360 Plus. [ 9 ] Roewe i6 In 2016, Roewe adopted a new design strategy, introducing a more streamlined alphanumeric naming system and a styling approach that featured fewer curves. The first model to represent this shift was the Roewe RX5 SUV, developed in partnership with Alibaba Group , which provided the software for the vehicle. [ 10 ] In 2018, Roewe debuted its first electric SUV, the Marvel X , and expanded its offerings with the introduction of the Ei5 , a fully electric 5-door station wagon. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] In 2021, the brand launched its first coupe SUV , the Jing , [ 13 ] followed by the release of the hybrid RX3 Pro variant, named Lomemo , in 2022. That same year saw the introduction of a new design language for the RX5's next generation and the release of the premium RX9 . [ 14 ] In 2023, Roewe introduced a new model line, the D7 , while simultaneously streamlining its portfolio by phasing out older, less popular models. In November 2024, SAIC Motor Passenger Vehicle announced to roll back the Rising Auto brand into Roewe, ending its history as an independent brand. Rising would turned into a premium electric product line under Roewe. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Logo Evolution [ edit ] 2007–2018 2018–present SAIC didn't decide to create a new name (autrement dit, a new brand) and a new logo, more than imitate Rover. The new Roewe logo retains the shape of the Rover logo but removes the longship (linked to the history of England) in favor of two lions surrounding a sword, overlooking a Gothic R and with a checkerboard in the background inspired by that of the German manufacturer BMW , but with the colors red and black. The two lions and the sword feature Chinese and not European script, which reinforces the identity of the new brand. In 2018, SAIC adopted a new logo for Roewe while retaining the shape of the previous one. A new blue colour is associated with innovation and high quality, but with the removal of the checkerboard in the background. The capital letters Roewe are located below the crest.

[ 19 ] Exports [ edit ] Outside of China, Roewe-derived models are currently sold under the MG marque. [ 20 ] In 2008, the Roewe 550 and 750 were launched in Chile under the names MG 550 and MG 750, respectively. [ 21 ] The smaller MG 350 and sporty MG 6 were displayed at the eleventh Santiago Motor Show in October 2010. [ 22 ] European sales first began in Belarus , with an MG-badged version of the 550. [ 23 ] British car magazine Autocar tested the Roewe 350 in 2010 suggesting that the model would be built and sold in the UK, but Roewe denied this. [ 24 ] Nonetheless, as of April 2011 SAIC's MG6 (a reworked Roewe 550) commenced assembly at the old MG Rover plant in Longbridge . The European market cars feature certain improvements over its Chinese siblings, meeting Euro V rather than Euro IV emissions standards.
