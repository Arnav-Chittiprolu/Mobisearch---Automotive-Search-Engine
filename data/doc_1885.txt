[ 16 ] It is one of three vehicles that ever receive such score from the Australasian safety programme. ANCAP has accused MG of "a lack of design effort to prevent rear-seat occupant injury in frontal impact and side impact scenarios". [ 17 ] In response, MG announced a $4 million worth of investment to introduce safety changes to the MG 5 to improve its crash-test performance for occupants by adding new collision avoidance features , which will be launched sometime in 2024 for the Australian market.
