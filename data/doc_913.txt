( December 2023 ) Global top-selling light-duty plug-in electric vehicle regional or country markets as of December 2021 [update] Comparison of plug-in electric car ownership per capita in selected top selling countries and regional markets as plug-in cars per 1,000 people, as of December 2021 [update] Electric car use by country varies worldwide, as the adoption of plug-in electric vehicles is affected by consumer demand, market prices, availability of charging infrastructure, and government policies, such as purchase incentives and long term regulatory signals ( ZEV mandates, CO 2 emissions regulations, fuel economy standards, and phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles ). [ 1 ] Plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are generally divided into all-electric or battery electric vehicles (BEVs), that run only on batteries, and plug-in hybrids (PHEVs), that combine battery power with internal combustion engines. The popularity of electric vehicles has been expanding rapidly due to government subsidies, improving charging infrastructure, their increasing range and lower battery costs, and environmental sensitivity. However, the stock of plug-in electric cars represented just 1% of all passengers vehicles on the world's roads by the end of 2020, of which pure electrics constituted two-thirds. [ 2 ] Global cumulative sales of highway-legal light-duty plug-in electric vehicles reached 1 million units in September 2015, [ 3 ] 5 million in December 2018, [ 4 ] and passed the 10 million milestone in 2020. [ 5 ] By mid-2022, there were over 20 million light-duty plug-in vehicles on the world's roads. [ 6 ] Sales of plug-in passenger cars achieved a 9% global market share of new car sales in 2021, up from 4.6% in 2020, and 2.5% in 2019. [ 2 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The PEV market has been shifting towards fully electric battery vehicles. The global ratio between BEVs and PHEVs went from 56:44 in 2012, to 60:40 in 2015, and rose to 74:26 in 2019. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The ratio was to 71:29 in 2021. [ 11 ] As of December 2023 [update] , China had the largest stock of highway legal plug-in passenger cars with 20.4 million units, almost half of the global fleet in use. [ 12 ] China also dominates the plug-in light commercial vehicle and electric bus deployment, with its stock reaching over 500,000 buses in 2019, 98% of the global stock, and 247,500 electric light commercial vehicles, 65% of the global fleet. [ 1 ] Europe had about 11.8 million plug-in passenger cars at the end of 2023, accounting for around 30% of the global stock. [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Europe also has the world's second largest electric light commercial vehicle stock, with about 290,000 vans. [ 13 ] [ 1 ] [ 15 ] As of June 2025 [update] , cumulative sales in the United States totaled 7.04 million plug-in cars since 2010, [ 16 ] with California listed as the largest U.S. plug-in regional market with 1.77 million plug-in cars sold by 2023. [ 17 ] As of December 2021 [update] , Germany is the leading European country with 1.38 million plug-in cars registered since 2010. [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Norway has the highest market penetration per capita in the world, [ 20 ] and also has the world's largest plug-in segment market share of new car sales, 86.2% in 2021. [ 21 ] Over 10% of all passenger cars on Norwegian roads were plug-ins in October 2018, and rose to 22% in 2021. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] The Netherlands has the highest density of EV charging stations in the world by 2019. [ 24 ] History [ edit ] See also: History of the electric vehicle Evolution of the ratio between global sales of BEVs and PHEVs from 2011 to 2024 [ 8 ] [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 11 ] [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The global stock of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) between 2005 and 2009 consisted exclusively of all-electric cars ( BEV ), totaling about 1,700 units in 2005, and almost 6,000 in 2009. The plug-in stock rose to about 12,500 units in 2010, of which 350 were plug-in hybrids (PHEVs). [ 29 ] [ 30 ] By comparison, during the Golden Age of the electric car at the beginning of the 20th century, the EV stock peaked at approximately 30,000 vehicles. [ 31 ] After the introduction of the Think City , Nissan Leaf and the Chevrolet Volt in late December 2010, the first mass-production plug-in electric cars by major manufacturers, plug-in sales grew to about 50,000 units in 2011, to 125,000 in 2012, and almost 213,000 cars and utility vans in 2013. Sales totaled over 315,000 units in 2014, up 48% from 2013. [ 32 ] In March 2014, Norway became the first country where over 1 in every 100 passenger cars on the roads was a plug-in, [ 33 ] and, by October 2018, 1 in every 10 passenger cars registered in Norway was a plug-in. [ 22 ] In five years, global sales of highway legal light-duty plug-in vehicles increased more than ten-fold, totaling more than 565,000 units in 2015—an 80% increase from 2014, driven mainly by China and Europe. [ 32 ] About 775,000 plug-in electric cars and vans were sold in 2016, and 1.22 million in 2017—up 57% from 2016—with China accounting for about half of global sales. [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] The global market share of the new light-duty plug-in segment reached 1.3% in 2017, up from 0.86% in 2016, and 0.38% in 2014. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Global light-duty plug-in vehicle sales passed the 3 million milestone in November 2017 [ 39 ] and 5 million at the end 2018. [ 4 ] Global sales totaled 2,018,247 plug-in passenger cars in 2018, up 72% from 2017, with a market share of 2.1%. [ 8 ] The BEV:PHEV ratio rose to 69:31 in 2018 and to 74:26 in 2019. [ 9 ] [ 8 ] By the end of 2019 the stock of light-duty plug-in vehicles totaled about 7.5 million units. [ 40 ] Worldwide sales in 2019 rose to 2,209,831 units with a global market share of 2.5%. [ 9 ] The combined number of PEV and hybrid cars sold in the European Union hit a record in July 2020, accounting for 18% of the total number of passenger cars sold. It also was the first time that more than 200,000 electric cars were sold in a single month.

[ 205 ] [ 206 ] Electric cars are currently used by the Albanian Police Force. [ 207 ] The Interior Minister claimed, that the cost of fuel per 100 km (62 mi) would be less than 120 Albanian leke (less than 1 euro). [ 207 ] Saytaxi is the first taxi company in Albania that offers electric vehicles and operates a fast EV (electric vehicles) charging point, and have been operating in the country since 2014. Its goal is to replace 80% of all non-electric cars with electric in the taxi business. [ 208 ] On 31 October 2017, Tirana became one of the few European capital cities to use electric buses when they tested a Solaris Urbino 12 , with the purpose of reducing pollution. [ 209 ] Tirana's goal is to gradually convert 10 to 20 percent of the bus fleet into electric ones. [ 209 ] Australia [ edit ] Main article: Plug-in electric vehicles in Australia The total stock of electric vehicles in Australia is approximately 21,000 as of 2020. [ 210 ] In May 2021, electric vehicles accounted for 2% of new car sales in Australia, with approximately 5,000 Tesla vehicles sold in the first half of 2021. [ 162 ] However, it has been predicted that approximately 66% of Australians will be driving electric cars by 2030. [ 211 ] Moreover, 56% of Australians would consider an electric car when they next bought a vehicle. [ 212 ] In early 2020, electric vehicle registrations nearly doubled the registrations of the previous year, showing the rapidly increasing popularity of electric vehicles in Australia. [ 213 ] The Tesla Model 3 is Australia's most popular electric vehicle accounting for 70% of EV sales in 2019. [ 214 ] [ 215 ] [ 216 ] [ 217 ] The Labor -led opposition government in Australia in 2019 proposed a 50% electric vehicle target by 2030. [ 218 ] Government analysis in 2019 also forecasted 50% of all new cars sold in Australia by 2035 will be electric on the current path. [ 219 ] The state of Victoria is Australia's most important electric vehicle market with the highest number of electric vehicle purchases in Australia between 2011 and 2017 with a total of 1,324 car sales. [ 220 ] Victoria also manufactures electric vehicles with a commercial electric vehicle manufacturing facility to be established in 2021, producing 2,400 vehicles per year.

The first public quick charging station was opened in April 2011. [ 277 ] In August 2014 Mitsubishi replaced the i-Miev with the Outlander PHEV. [ citation needed ] Later that year BMW introduced their "i" range with the i3; [ citation needed ] Renault launched their Zero Emission (Z.E.) lineup, including the Fluence Z.E. sedan, the Kangoo utility van and Zoe city car. The French brand sold 22 electric vehicles in their first month in the Chilean market. [ citation needed ] Colombia [ edit ] The BEV Renault Twizy quadricycle is the top selling electric vehicle in Colombia. Latin America's first battery electric taxi fleet of 45 vehicles was launched at the beginning of 2013 in Bogotá, the largest electric taxi fleet in South America at the time. [ 278 ] These taxis were exempted from the Pico y placa driving restriction scheme. The program is an effort to improve air quality and set an example. [ 279 ] [ 280 ] [ 281 ] The BMW i3 was introduced in Colombia in 2014. The BEV Renault Twizy quadricycle was introduced in the Colombian market in June 2015 [ 282 ] and, as of October 2015 [update] , 203 Twizys had been sold.

These include the exemption from the driving restriction scheme in place in Colombian cities such as Bogotá and Medellín . The government exempted BEV and PHEV cars from import duties for three years, with an annual quota of 750 cars of each type. [ 284 ] Costa Rica [ edit ] Costa Rica led the market share of the plug-in electric passenger car segment in the Americas in 2024. Fully electric BMW i3 with special green plates issued in Costa Rica for battery electric vehicles As of December 2023 [update] , Costa Rica had a stock of 9,345 light-duty all-electric vehicles . In addition, the country had a stock of 1,243 all-electric motorcycles. [ 285 ] Registrations of light duty all-electric vehicles totaled 6,312 units in 2023, more than doubling cumulative sales since 2010. [ 286 ] The all-electric market share achieved a record 11.6% of all new car sales in 2023, up from 7.3% in 2022, and ranking as the highest in the Americas. [ 142 ] The fleet of fully electric passenger cars grew from 94 units in 2010 to 183 in 2017. After the approval of the 2018 law that granted import duty and value added tax exemptions, the fleet grew from 377 units in 2018, to 1,446 in 2020, and reached 8,963 all-electric cars registered by the end of 2023. [ 285 ] Plug-in hybrids and conventional hybrid electric vehicles do not have government financial incentives, therefore they are not included in this statistical data. The first electric car to go on sale in the country was the REVAi , introduced in March 2009. The REVAi, powered by lead–acid batteries , sold 10 units. [ 287 ] The Mitsubishi i MiEV was launched in February 2011, with initial availability limited to 25 to 50 units. [ 288 ] [ 289 ] [ 290 ] According to Mitsubishi, Costa Rica was selected at the first market launch in the Americas due to its environmental record, despite the lack of government incentives for purchasing electric cars. [ 290 ] [ 291 ] The top selling model in 2016 was the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV with 60 units. [ 292 ] Other all-electric and plug-in hybrid cars introduced early in Costa Rica include the BYD Qin (November 2013), [ 293 ] [ 294 ] Mitsubishi Outlander (March 2015) [ 295 ] and BMW i3 (September 2016). [ 296 ] As of January 2024 [update] , over 50 all-electric models are offered in the Costa Rican market, mainly from Chinese and European carmakers. [ 285 ] Government incentives All-electric buses on trial as part of a pilot project in Costa Rica In 2006 electric cars were exempted from the consumption tax , while conventional vehicles faced a 30% rate. 
In October 2012, electric cars were exempted from San José 's driving restrictions . [ 297 ] EVs were exempted from import duties and the government agreed to deploy charging stations in strategic locations in San José. [ 298 ] In January 2018, the "Law for the Promotion of Electric Transportation" went into effect, which promotes the adoption of electric vehicles through the implementation of incentives and tax exemptions when purchasing an all-electric car. The law grants exemption from three taxes: value added, selective consumption and import duties, 100% for electric vehicles price at US$30,000 CIF , and the exempted percentage is reduced gradually as the value goes up, with a cap of US$60,000 . Electric vehicles are also exempt from the annual circulation fee, which phases out by 20% each year during a five-year period. [ 299 ] The price cap was removed in 2022 and each of the tax exemptions gradually decreases over a period of 12 years until all phase out. Croatia [ edit ] As of December 2016 [update] , 2067 electric cars had been sold in Croatia. [ 300 ] [ 301 ] Of these, 224 were EVs, while the rest were hybrids. [ 300 ] As of September 2017 [update] , 201 free public charging stations operated in Croatia. [ 300 ] In 2014 and 2015, the Croatian government initiated purchase incentives. [ 302 ] [ 303 ] The subsidies were discontinued in 2016, due to ineffectiveness. [ 300 ] [ needs update ] Czech Republic [ edit ] Main article: Plug-in electric vehicles in the Czech Republic Sales of new battery electric vehicles (BEV) rose from 298 in 2015 to 703 in 2018. At the first half of 2019, 360 new BEV were sold, representing 0.3% of the overall sales.

[ 304 ] In the following decade, very few electric cars were sold in Denmark, but a clear increase began around 2010. [ 305 ] In 2015, Denmark was the second largest European market for light-duty, plug-in commercial vehicles or utility vans, with over 2,600 plug-in vans sold that year, representing 8.5% of all vans sold. Most vans were plug-in hybrids, accounting for almost all EU plug-in van sales. [ 306 ] Up to and including 2015, electric cars had been exempt from vehicle registration tax, but it was decided that this would be gradually outphased: In 2016, the vehicle registration tax for electric cars was placed at 20% of the normal rate, in 2017 it was planned to increase to 40% and within five years it would become the full rate. This had a large effect on the sale, which drastically fell in 2016–17. [ 307 ] As a consequence, it was decided that the increase in vehicle registration tax for electric vehicles would be delayed, being capped at 20% of the normal rate in 2017–19, then gradually increasing until 2023 where it would become the full rate. A new fund for fuel cell vehicles was also started. [ 308 ] In 2020, a new taxation deal was reached, valid for all cars from 2021 to 2030. Its rates depend heavily on the CO 2 -emission of the car. This means that vehicle registration tax for all-electric cars (BEVs) that cost less than 510,000 DKK (€68,500) will remain very low with a slower than initially planned gradual increase to normal levels, most plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) will increase from 2021 but remain lower than gasoline and diesel cars, and diesel cars will increase. The goal of this plan is to have at least 775,000 electric cars (BEV or PHEV) by 2030. Combined with other plans, it is the goal to have at least 1 million zero-emission or low-emission cars by 2030 and that no new gasoline or diesel cars will be sold in the country from that year. [ 309 ] [ 310 ] As of 31 December 2021 [update] , there were a total of 2,781,855 registered cars in Denmark, of which more than 5%, or 144,498, are electric (BEV or PHEV).

The majority of electric cars in Estonia are i-MiEVs. As of February 2015 [update] , 1,188 plug-in vehicles were registered. [ citation needed ] Estonia was the first country to deploy an EV charging network with nationwide coverage, with fast chargers available along highways at a maximum distance of 40 to 60 km (25 to 37 mi). [ 315 ] [ 316 ] As of December 2012 [update] , the nationwide network consisted of 165 fast chargers. [ 317 ] [ 318 ] [ 319 ] In 2011, the government confirmed the sale to Mitsubishi of 10 million carbon dioxide credits in exchange for 507 i-MiEV electric cars. The deal included funding 250 fast charging stations and subsidies for the first 500 private buyers of any electric approved by the EU. [ 320 ] [ 321 ] The first 50 i-MiEVs were delivered in October 2011, for use by municipal social workers. [ 322 ] [ 323 ] [ 324 ] [ 325 ] Sales of new battery electric vehicles (BEV) rose from 34 in 2015 to 85 in 2018, after a stagnation in 2016 and 2017. At the first half of 2019, 42 new BEV were sold, representing 0.2% of the overall sales.

[ 326 ] Ecuador [ edit ] The offer and demand for electric vehicles in the South American nation is reduced. Electric charging stations are present in several shopping malls and public parking in Guayaquil, Quito, Cuenca, Ambato and Loja. In Ecuador, all electric vehicles are exempt from customs duties and taxes starting in June 2019. The electric vehicle offer in the country is set to increase. The Ecuadorean government has been incentivizing the use of electric vehicles with tax cuts. However, both the offer and demand remained short, encouraging the government to eliminate all duties to electric vehicles. The first commercially available EV was Kia Soul EV 2016. Being at the moment the brand with the most presence of EV in Ecuador. As of 2021 KIA, BYD and Nissan are among the EV brands offering vehicles for the Ecuadorian market. Europe overview [ edit ] Main article: Plug-in electric vehicles in Europe Evolution of annual registrations of plug-in electric passenger cars in Europe between 2011 and 2021 Europe had about 5.6 million plug-in electric passenger cars and light commercial vehicles in circulation at the end of 2021. [ 1 ] [ 194 ] [ 15 ] [ 25 ] As of December 2019 [update] , Europe accounted for 25% of the global stock, the second largest after China.

[ 335 ] These goals are part of the Finnish government efforts to comply with the 2015 Paris Agreement . [ 335 ] Basic charging infrastructure is available all over Finland, used for winter engine pre-warming. Because of its climate – cold winters and warm summers – Finland is considered a convenient "test laboratory" for electric cars. Many companies in Finland are involved in next-generation vehicle manufacturing, including Valmet Automotive , [ 337 ] Fortum (concept cars and infrastructure), Vacon (electric motor technology production), Ensto (production of charging units), Elcat (electric vehicle production since the 1980s), Raceabout [ 338 ] (specialist electric sport car with very few sales). Research related to electric cars is in progress at the VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and Tekes. [ 339 ] Electric car organizations in Finland include the Electric Vehicle Association of Finland and Electric Vehicles Finland. A non-commercial electric car conversion organization is called Electric Cars – Now! [ 340 ] that converts Toyota Corollas into Li-ion battery-powered electric cars.

[ 350 ] [ 351 ] Initially, the government did not provide subsidies in favor of research. [ 350 ] The Bundestag passed the Electric Mobility Act in March 2015 that authorized local government to grant non-monetary incentives. The measures privilege battery-powered cars, fuel cell vehicles and some PHEVs, by granting local governments the authority to offer additional incentives. [ 352 ] [ 353 ] [ 354 ] [ 355 ] An incentive scheme was approved in April 2016 including purchase subsidies, charging stations and another federal government fleet purchases, with a target of 400,000 electric vehicles. Premium cars, such as the Tesla Model S and BMW i8, were not eligible. [ 356 ] [ 357 ] [ 358 ] To meet the climate targets for the transport sector , in 2016 the government set the goal to have from 7 to 10 million plug-in electric cars on the road by 2030, and 1 million charging points available in Germany also by 2030. [ 359 ] As a result of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic , the government approved in June 2020 an economic recovery plan which included €8 billion to promote electric vehicle adoption and deployment of charging infrastructure. [ 360 ] The purchase bonus for electric cars was raised from €6,000 to €9,000 up until the end of 2021, the highest economic incentive in any European country, but the subsidy is available only for cars costing less than €40,000 . Also, other tax incentives for electric vehicles were introduced since 2020. [ 359 ] [ 360 ] Later, the government decided to keep the €9,000 bonus for the purchase of new all-electric cars and plug-in hybrids until the end of 2025. [ 361 ] The original one million goal was achieved in July 2021. [ 362 ] Greece [ edit ] Main article: Plug-in electric vehicles in Greece Sales of new battery electric vehicles (BEV) rose from 35 in 2015 to 190 in 2019.

The plan includes purchase subsidizing, exemption from the road tax and any parking fees, as well as incentives for setting up charging stations, for pure electric private passenger cars and motorbikes, as well as for pure electric or plug-in hybrid taxis and light commercial vehicles . The government's subsidy covers the purchase of new BEVs and PHEVs with a total of 100 million euros for 18 months in the first phase, which is estimated to cover 25% of the cost of about 14.000 new electric vehicles. [ 365 ] [ 366 ] [ 367 ] The government will subsidize the purchase of each new electric vehicle, covering 15% of its cost (up to €5.500) for private passenger and light commercial vehicles, 20% of the cost (up to €800) for motorbikes and 25% of the cost (up to €8.000) for taxis. Vehicle owners that will concurrently retire their old vehicle will receive an additional bonus of up to €2.500. [ 368 ] Furthermore, expenses for charging the electric car will be exempt from taxable income. The benefit for each new electric car, if combined with the ecological bonus and the relevant tax exemptions, will approach 10.000 euros. [ 365 ] [ 366 ] [ 367 ] Hong Kong [ edit ] Main article: Plug-in electric vehicles in Hong Kong As of June 2023 [update] the total is 60,943 EVs.

[ 390 ] Government officials reached agreements with French car maker Renault and its partner Nissan . As of September 2014 [update] , purchase incentives became available. [ 391 ] As of the start of 2020, Electric Vehicles (EVs) was as a proportion of all cars for sale in Ireland very small, which could be seen in a snapshot (7 February 2020) of four different car sales websites (Autotrader.ie, Carsireland.ie, Carzone.ie, and Donedeal.ie) which showed that out of circa 38,000 to 70,000 cars listed for sale, only circa 0.7% to 1.1% were EV's, so in real terms only 431–616 EV cars were advertised for sale in the market. This very low level of EVs compared poorly to the circa 25,338 to 46,940 diesel cars shown available for sale on the same date, representing a much larger, circa 64–67% of the market at that time. The Irish Government (to January 2020) had stated an aim to ban the sale of petrol, diesel and hybrid new ('non-electric') cars from 2030 (compared to the proposed EU ban by 2040, and the UK's proposed ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars from 2035 as announced in the first week of February 2020) though car dealers were reported in 2020 to consider the Irish Government's target for one million electric and plug-in hybrid cars to be in use by 2030, as far too ambitious, though Government grants of up to €10,000 also available (as of 2020)(The Irish Times, 7 February 2020). It was also reported (The Irish Times, 7 February 2020) in the Irish newspapers in February 2020 that there were at that time about 1,200 electric car (EV) charging points in Ireland, but that this was compared to Norway, the European leader in EV transition, with approximately 12,000 charging stations for circa 300,000 EVs and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV). A compromise in terms of transition and non-electric ban implementation around 2030 maybe for acceptance also of Hybrid cars with smaller conventional petrol engines (regardless of whether the vehicles are 'full' or 'mild' hybrids) of for example at/ less than 1.6-liter (1600 cc) capacity, and/ or say less circa 100 g/km CO 2 or less in terms of emissions, or a good fuel efficiency rating (L/100 km ) for highway/extra urban and 'combined' journeys.

Further, many Italian houses were equipped with electric contracts allowing only 3 kW of peak consumption, making home charging of electric cars impractical. [ 397 ] [ 398 ] [ 399 ] Since 2021 the EV market share in Italy has stagnated: while in 2021 BEVs were 4.6% of total market share the number dwindled to 3.8% in 2022. Italy lags behind most of the other Western European countries in terms of EV market size and number of EVs per capita.

[ 1 ] [ 184 ] [ 182 ] The decline in plug-in sales reflects the governmental and domestic carmaker decision to promote hydrogen fuel cell vehicles instead. [ 403 ] [ 404 ] The market share further fell to 0.7% in 2019 and 0.6% in 2020. [ 402 ] In May 2009 the Japanese Diet passed the "Green Vehicle Purchasing Promotion Measure". [ 405 ] The program provided purchasing subsidies for cars, mini and keis , trucks and buses, including an extra subsidy for purchases trading in a sufficiently old used car. [ 405 ] [ 406 ] The program ended on 31 March 2010. [ 407 ] [ 408 ] The Japanese electric vehicle charging infrastructure climbed from 60 public stations in 2010 to 1,381 in 2012.

[ 432 ] Nepal [ edit ] Main article: Plug-in electric vehicles in Nepal A Mahindra e2o in Nepal Nepal led Asia's new car sales of electric vehicles in 2023 with a market share of 83%. Nearly all of Nepal's energy is from renewable sources generated by hydropower. Nepal has also prioritized infrastructure development to support ownership of EVs, making it simple to own one. [ 438 ] There were 45,000 electric vehicles running in Nepal as of 2019. [ 439 ] Although detailed information is not available, over 50% of the cars sold in Nepal in 2022 were electric. [ 440 ] Nepal is one of the best countries to buy an EV. Electric cars are actually a better deal in Nepal due to following reasons: Extremely low import tax compared to fossil fuel vehicle. (238% for fuel and 10% for electric) Hydropower makes it clean energy. (91% of the electricity comes from hydro in Nepal) No fossil fuel production. (Nepal imports fossil fuels and the prices are usually high) Netherlands [ edit ] Main article: Plug-in electric vehicles in the Netherlands Stock of light-duty plug-in electric vehicles on the road in the Netherlands (2011–2021) As of 31 December 2021 [update] , there were 390,454 highway-legal light-duty plug-in electric vehicles in use in the Netherlands, consisting of 137,663 fully electric cars, 243,664 plug-in hybrid cars, and 9,127 light duty plug-in commercial vehicles. [ 441 ] The fleet in circulation of plug-in electric passenger cars represented 4.3% of all passenger cars in Dutch roads at the end of 2021, up from 3.1% in 2020. [ 441 ] The plug-in market share declined from 9.9% in 2015, to 6.7% in 2016, and fell to 2.6% in 2017. After several adjustments in the financial incentives and tax code to favor the purchase of all-electric vehicles, the market share rose to 14.9% in 2019, 24.6% in 2020, and achieved 29.8% in 2021, now with dominance of battery electric vehicle sales since 2019. [ 441 ] [ 442 ] A Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV in Amsterdam From 1 January 2016, all-electric vehicles continue to pay a 4% registration fee, but for a plug-in hybrids the fee rises from 7% to 15% if its CO 2 emissions do not exceed 50 g/km. The rate for a conventional internal combustion car is 25% of its book value. [ 443 ] [ 444 ] The Dutch government set a target of 15,000 electric vehicles in 2015, 200,000 in 2020 and 1 million in 2025. [ 445 ] The government exempted selected vehicles from registration fee and road taxes. [ 446 ] [ 447 ] [ 448 ] The exemption from the registration tax ended in 2013. [ 449 ] Battery electric vehicles have special access to parking spaces in Amsterdam , queues for which can otherwise reach up to 10 years. [ 450 ] Free charging is offered in public parking spaces. [ 451 ] Other factors contributing to the rapid adoption of plug-in electric vehicles are the Netherlands' small size, which reduces range anxiety ; a long tradition of environmental activism; high gasoline prices ( US$8.50 per gallon as of January 2013); and some EV leasing programs that provide free or discounted gasoline-powered vehicles for covering long distances.

[ 104 ] [ 105 ] [ 574 ] The segment market share was 3.1% in 2019, rose to 10.7% in 2020, [ 576 ] and achieved a record 18.6% in 2021. [ 107 ] As of June 2020 [update] , the Mitsubishi Outlander P-HEV is the all-time top selling plug-in car in the UK over 46,400 units registered, followed by the Nissan Leaf more than 31,400 units. [ 577 ] Government incentives [ edit ] See also: Plug-in Car Grant The government offered purchase incentives via the Plug-in Car Grant program beginning in 2011. The program was extended to include vans in February 2012 and in October 2016 to include large electric trucks. As of September 2018 [update] , a total of 176,962 eligible cars have benefited with the subsidy since the launch of the Plug-in Car Grant in 2011, [ 578 ] and, as of September 2018 [update] , the number of claims made through the Plug-in Van Grant scheme totaled 5,218 units since the launch of the programme in 2012. [ 579 ] In April 2014 and December 2015, the government extended the program with modifications. Eligible ultra-low emission vehicles (ULEVs) included hydrogen fuel cell vehicles . [ 580 ] [ 581 ] [ 582 ] Separately, the government subsidized homeowners to install charge points at home via the "Electric Vehicle Homecharge Scheme". [ 581 ] [ 582 ] All-electric vehicles and eligible plug-in hybrids qualify for a 100% discount from the London congestion charge . [ 583 ] However, effective from 8 April 2019, the ULED scheme will be replaced with the Cleaner Vehicle Discount, which restrict the discount only to vehicles which are Euro 6 , emit up to 75g/km of CO 2 and have a minimum 32-kilometre (20 mi) zero-emission range. A further phase from October 2021 will mean that only zero-emission vehicles ( battery electric vehicle and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles ) will qualify for the discount, which will be phased out completely from December 2025. [ 584 ] United States [ edit ] Main article: Plug-in electric vehicles in the United States U.S. annual sales of plug-in passenger cars between December 2010 and 2023 As of June 2025 [update] , cumulative sales of highway legal plug-in electric cars in the U.S. totaled 7,044,757 units since 2010. [ 16 ] California is the largest plug-in regional market in the country, with 1 million plug-in cars registered  by November 2021, 46% of the national stock. [ 17 ] The other nine states that follow California Air Resources Board 's Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) regulations accounted for another 10% of the American stock. [ 585 ] California is the largest plug-in regional market in the country, with plug-in car sales of 237,618 units in 2021, up from 132,742 in 2020 (+79.0%). The state's plug-in segment market share increased from 4.9% in 2017, to 8.1% in 2020, and reached 12.8% in 2021. [ 190 ] The Tesla Model S (front) was the U.S. best selling plug-in car from 2015 to 2017, and the Tesla Model 3 (back) has led sales from 2018 and 2020. [ 586 ] [ 587 ] [ 588 ] [ 589 ] The American plug-in segment had a market share of 1.13% in 2017, up from 0.90% in 2016, then rose to 2.1% in 2018. [ 156 ] [ 157 ] [ 590 ] A slightly declined to 1.9% occurred in 2019, rose to 2.2% in 2020, 4.0% in 2021, 6.8% in 2022, and achieved 9,4% in 2023. [ 16 ] [ 154 ] [ 155 ] Until 2018, the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid was the all-time best selling plug-in electric car with 152,144 units of both generations. [ 587 ] [ 591 ] [ 592 ] The Tesla Model 3 all-electric car surpassed in 2019 the discontinued Chevrolet Volt to become the all-time best selling plug-in car in U.S. history, with an estimated 300,471 units delivered since inception, followed by the Tesla Model S with about 157,992, and the Chevrolet Volt with 157,054. [ 593 ] The Tesla Model S was the best selling plug-in car in the U.S. for three consecutive years, from 2015 to 2017, [ 588 ] and the Model 3 topped sales also for three years running, from 2018 to 2020. [ 586 ] [ 587 ] [ 589 ] As of April 2021, three US states have introduced government mandates to ban the sale of gasoline powered cars in the future to push the transition to electric vehicles. Washington state's legislation would ban all sales and registrations of gasoline powered light vehicles made for or after their 2030 model year. California would ban the sale of all new fuel burning cars by 2035. Massachusetts would ban the sale of all new gasoline powered cars by 2035. [ 594 ] In December 2021, the Biden administration imposed Executive Order 14057, which is a nationwide federal government mandate that will ban new fossil fuel vehicles from all 50 US States, Washington, D.C., and all US Territories by 2035 to push the transition to electric vehicles. The order will ban new car sales of fossil fuel-powered government-owned vehicles by 2027, new fossil fuel-powered buses by 2030, and both new fossil fuel-powered privately owned vehicles and new fossil fuel-powered commercial-owned vehicles by 2035. The US Environmental Protection Agency also unveiled stringent automotive emissions and fuel economy requirements for internal combustion engine-powered vehicles that will become mandatory on all new US-market ICE-powered vehicles starting for the 2023 model year. The standards will also get tougher and more stringent for the 2026, 2029, and 2032 model years. The new regulations will also require at least 20% of all new vehicles sold in the United States to be 100% all-electric vehicles by 2026, followed by requiring at least 55% of all new vehicles sold in the United States to be 100% all-electric vehicles by 2030, and finally followed by requiring 100% of all new vehicles sold in the United States to be 100% all-electric vehicles by 2035. [ 595 ] [ 596 ] Uruguay [ edit ] Main article: Plug-in electric vehicles in Uruguay Reporting of plug-in electric vehicle sales in Uruguay began in 2019, with 163 vehicles sold. Government financial incentives plus high fossil fuel costs supported a strong annual growth rate, reaching 1,044 BEV vehicles sales in 2022, and a market share of 1.8% of total vehicle sales. [ 597 ] To support this continuous growth, the Government extended the tax exemption for the purchase of all-electric vehicles with a retail price of up to US$40.000 . [ 598 ] BEV sales in 2023 grew by 80.92% to 1,887, a 3.14% market share of total vehicle sales. [ 172 ] Total BEV sales in 2024 achieved 5,856 units, more than three times all electric vehicles sold in 2023 with a market share of 8.9% of total vehicle sales. [ 174 ] Growth continued in 2025: by the end of November 2025, cumulative sales of the year achieved 12,816 units, with a market share of 19.9%. [ 599 ] Uruguay ranked as the country with the second largest market share of the all-electric passenger car segment in Latin America , both in 2022 and 2023. The city of Montevideo had by July 2023 140 BEV taxis in circulation (of a total of around 3,000, or 4.7%), with a target to reach 200 by the end of 2023. [ 600 ] The Uruguayan government through its Industry Ministry started offering in November 2022 a US$5,000 subsidy (applied as a post-sale rebate) for the replacement of up to 100 thermal taxis and ride-hailing vehicles. Of those 100 subsidies, geographically 93 were allocated to Montevideo and 7 to other departments of the country, while 88 were allocated to replacing ride-hailing vehicles, 11 to taxis and 1 to a remisse. [ 601 ] As an additional support, in July 2023 the local government of Montevideo is offering a subsidy of 200,000UYU (approximately US$5,000) for the replacement of up to 85 thermal taxis with electric ones, 30 of which were reserved for taxi cooperatives. [ 600 ] On 21 May 2025, at the presentation of 25 new electric taxis, the Director of Mobility for the city of Montevideo estimated that there were 225 BEV taxis in circulation (about 7.5% of the total). [ 602 ] Following the previous successful experience, the national Industry Ministry renewed the plan on 27 September 2024, offering this time a US$4,000 subsidy (again, as post-sale rebate) for the replacement of up to 100 thermal taxis, remisses or ride-hailing vehicles for electric ones; even though the subsidy offered is US$1,000 less than the previous program, as an upgrade the program adds a 20% rebate (up to US$400) for the purchase of a car charger, as well as allowing up to 10 subsidy requests per owner. [ 603 ] All of the subsidies of this batch were allocated by 8 April 2025. [ 604 ] Due to the fact that many taxi and remisse operators purchase their vehicles under leasing, on 9 December 2024 the Industry Ministry added an additional 50 subsidies to be used exclusively for this financing methodology and only for taxis and remisses; when the initial 100 subsidies are exhausted, the remaining subsidies from this leasing batch are to be allocated to the initial conditions of the program. [ 605 ] As of 22 May 2025, all subsidies have been exhausted. [ 604 ] The Industry Ministry is also offering since 5 September 2024 a subsidy (as post-sale rebate) of US$3,000 for the purchase of electric cargo vehicles and 20% rebate (up to US$400) for the purchase of an electric charger, allowing up to 10 subsidy requests per purchaser; as of 3 December 2025, there are 59 subsidies remaining. [ 606 ] Focusing on ride-hailing apps, on 15 May 2025 the app Cabify informed that 30% of their rides were done with BEVs, using this opportunity to launch its "ECO" service, using only electric vehicles at the standard service price, while at the same time giving special bonuses for their drivers. [ 607 ] Regarding mass transit, as of 2021 there were 32 BEV buses in operation of a total of 5,391 buses nationwide (including urban, suburban and regional buses). [ 608 ] The main urban bus transport company in Montevideo (CUTCSA, with 1148 buses) adhered to COP26 emission targets, pledging to achieve a 25% of BEV fleet by 2025 (around 280 buses), reaching 100% by 2040. [ 609 ] On 28 February 2024 the company announced that during 2024 CUTCSA will replace 90 diesel buses for electric ones, also installing a bus charging station next to one of their depots, partially open to other bus companies, [ 610 ] and on 29 February 2024 it was announced that those buses will be Higer Azure A12BR, the same model as the prototype purchased by CUTCSA in 2023. [ 611 ] The first batch of 50 Higer buses (including 6 double-decker for tourist services), shipped in August 2024, arrived in Montevideo on 16 October 2024 [ 612 ] and started operations in November 2024. The second batch of Higer buses (all suburban units) was shipped in December 2024, arriving in Montevideo on 25 February 2025 [ 613 ] and starting operations on 24 March 2025. [ 614 ] On 11 April 2024 CUTCSA announced the signature of the contract for the delivery of 100 BYD K9UD electric buses, order starting in 2024 to be completed by June 2025; the company also announced that on 9 April 2024 it signed the purchase of 100 200kWh chargers from the Chinese manufacturer Ekingpow, to be distributed among their depots. [ 615 ] On 19 September 2024 BYD delivered those 100 K9UD buses on their factory in Qingdao, China with the presence of CUTCSA authorities, [ 616 ] the first 50 arriving on 3 December 2024 and starting operations in January 2025. [ 617 ] The second batch of 50 BYD K9UD buses were shipped from Shanghai on 20 July 2025 on Grimaldi's Ro-Ro vessel Great Casablanca, [ 618 ] arriving in Montevideo on 1 October 2025, for a total of 221 electric buses for the company (about 19% of the fleet). [ 619 ] Furthermore, on 18 September 2024 the company announced the plan to purchase in 2025 the remaining 59 electric buses required to achieve their target of 25% fleet electrification, pending the completion of some infrastructure on their depots. [ 620 ] On 8 September 2025 it was announced that the CAF – Development Bank of Latin America had provided a loan to CUTCSA of 20 Million USD, in order to purchase the remaining 60 electric buses to achieve the company's electrification target. [ 621 ] During 2023 the remaining bus companies in Montevideo, COME and transport cooperatives COETC and UCOT selected Yutong as supplier for another batch of locally adapted electric buses (divided windows, different couches, among others), being 9 for COETC, 7 for UCOT and 5 for COME; the first one (a prototype, destined for COETC) arrived in February 2024, while another 19 arrived at late April (a final one, for UCOT, arrived in October 2024). [ 622 ] [ 623 ] The local government of Montevideo issued in February 2024 a US$37.3 million bond for the replacement of an additional 90 diesel buses for electric ones (to be distributed 60 for CUTCSA and the remaining 30 among the bus cooperatives), funds to be managed by the local Transport Authority. [ 624 ] Also, the national government program "Subite Buses" is funding the investment of several Departments' local governments to purchase 10 additional electric buses in 2023. [ 625 ] The local government of Salto expects to receive their subsidized bus in November 2023, expecting to buy an extra 5 units in the short term, [ 626 ] achieving an electrification rate of around 13% of the local buses. On 28 November 2023, the Subite Buses program delivered the first electric buses to de departments of Maldonado, Flores, Tacuarembo and Salto, expecting to deliver buses to the departments of San Jose, Artigas and Río Negro by February 2024. [ 627 ] In Durazno, the local company Nossar purchased two Ankai electric buses for their urban service, which started operations in July 2023. [ 628 ] [ 629 ] Meanwhile, on 6 February 2024 the Department of Canelones announced the purchase of 8 electric buses (from Yutong, Ankai and Guangdong) for their urban and suburban lines, to be distributed among 5 mass transit companies; [ 630 ] those buses were presented on 10 May 2025, also mentioning that an additional bus was being acquired through the "Subite Buses" program. [ 631 ] On 12 October 2025 the company CODESA, which operates urban and suburban transport services in the Department of Maldonado, announced the purchase of 4 Akai electric buses, [ 632 ] which were presented on 25 November 2025. [ 633 ] The national government informed on 20 June 2024 that it was revamping the so called "gasoil trust fund", that helped subsidize the cost of diesel fuel for buses, as well as replacements of units; the new trust fund will stop funding new diesel buses, accepting only new electric buses to receive the subsidy (all previously funded buses will continue to receive funding). [ 634 ] Alongside the increasing sales there has been a strong expansion of the charging network: there were 150 charging stations at the end of 2022 (most of them slow charging), with a target of 300 public charging stations, or one every 50 km, by the end of 2023. [ 635 ] Finally, on 19 March 2024 the 300th charger was turned on in the city of Trinidad, Flores Department, by the President of the Republic, Luis Lacalle Pou. [ 636 ] On 15 May 2024 Silvia Emaldi, the president of the national electric company (UTE), indicated that the country had decided to implement the European standard for the chargers, basically Type 2 and CCS2, but will maintain the ones already installed that had the Chinese standard so that older vehicles could use the network. [ 637 ] The government is also creating incentives so private companies can install charging stations throughout the country, [ 638 ] and the national electric company (UTE) announced that from 15 November 2023 to end of June 2024 there will be a rebate of 4,048UYU (about US$100) for domestic consumers that install a car charger at their homes. [ 639 ] On 15 March 2024 the company Evergo, working with local renewable energy company Ventus, announced plans for a private network of electric chargers, investing u$s 5M to achieve the installation of 240 chargers throughout the country in three years (around 80 per year), of which 40% will have 50 kW of power, while the 60% remaining will have 20 kW. [ 640 ] On 13 September 2024 another company, eOne, announced a plan for the installation of 100 DC fast chargers in the following 12 months, starting with a 5-charger station and following up with 18 additional chargers in 2024. [ 641 ] On 21 November 2024 UTE opened the first ultra-fast DC charging station in Montevideo (up to 480kW) donated by Huawei; initially with two charging ports, the station (powered at 600kW but upgradeable to 720kW) is expected to increase its size to 12 charging ports in the near term. [ 642 ] On 27 July 2025 it was reported that at the moment there are 460 charging points in the country, with 363 being managed by UTE and the remaining by private companies; additionally, UTE plans to install 70 new fast chargers during the rest of the year, focusing on densification of the network in an attempt to reduce the network constrains. [ 643 ] On 15 August 2025 the national oil company ( ANCAP ) opened a specially designed area on its service station next to the airport of Montevideo (Carrasco - MVD) with 6 new fast chargers, as a concept to be expanded to other service stations around the country.
