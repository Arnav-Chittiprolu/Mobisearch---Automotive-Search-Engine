Do not fill this in! ===Sealing multiphase pumping applications===
Multiphase pumping applications, also referred to as tri-phase, have grown due to increased oil drilling activity. In addition, the economics of multiphase production is attractive to upstream operations as it leads to simpler, smaller in-field installations, reduced equipment costs and improved production rates. In essence, the multiphase pump can accommodate all fluid stream properties with one piece of equipment, which has a smaller footprint. Often, two smaller multiphase pumps are installed in series rather than having just one massive pump.

==== Types and features of multiphase pumps ====

===== Helico-axial (centrifugal) =====
A rotodynamic pump with one single shaft that requires two mechanical seals, this pump uses an open-type axial impeller. It is often called a ''Poseidon pump'', and can be described as a cross between an axial compressor and a centrifugal pump.

===== Twin-screw (positive-displacement) =====
The twin-screw pump is constructed of two inter-meshing screws that move the pumped fluid. Twin screw pumps are often used when pumping conditions contain high gas volume fractions and fluctuating inlet conditions. Four mechanical seals are required to seal the two shafts.

===== Progressive cavity (positive-displacement) =====
Progressive Cavity Pumps are well suited to pump sludge, slurries, viscous, and shear sensitive fluids.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Daniel |first1=Alvarado |title=Production Engineer |url=https://www.sulzer.com/en/products/pumps/pumps-by-type/progressing-cavity-pumps |website=sulzer |access-date=6 March 2025}}</ref> Progressive cavity pumps are single-screw types use in surface and downhole oil production.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Alvarado |first1=Daniel |title=Production Engineer |url=https://www.slb.com/resource-library/oilfield-review/defining-series/defining-pcp |website=slb |access-date=6 March 2025}}</ref> They serve a vast arrange of industries and applications ranging from Wastewater Treatment,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Daniel |first1=Alvarado |title=Production Engineer |url=https://accapumps.com/progressive-cavity-pumps-in-wastewater-treatment-the-ultimate-solution-for-efficient-fluid-handling/ |website=ACCA Pumps |date=25 February 2025 |access-date=6 March 2025}}</ref> Pulp and Paper, oil and gas, mining, and oil and gas.

===== Electric submersible (centrifugal) =====
These pumps are basically multistage centrifugal pumps and are widely used in oil well applications as a method for artificial lift. These pumps are usually specified when the pumped fluid is mainly liquid.

''Buffer tank''
A buffer tank is often installed upstream of the pump suction nozzle in case of a [[slug flow]]. The buffer tank breaks the energy of the liquid slug, smooths any fluctuations in the incoming flow and acts as a sand trap.

As the name indicates, multiphase pumps and their mechanical seals can encounter a large variation in service conditions such as changing process fluid composition, temperature variations, high and low operating pressures and exposure to abrasive/erosive media. The challenge is selecting the appropriate mechanical seal arrangement and support system to ensure maximized seal life and its overall effectiveness.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Johnson |first=Emily |title=Sealing Multiphase Pumping Applications {{!}} Seals {{!}} Seals |url=http://pump-zone.com/seals/seals/sealing-multiphase-pumping-applications.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090903074300/http://pump-zone.com/seals/seals/sealing-multiphase-pumping-applications.html |archive-date=2009-09-03 |access-date=2025-06-23 |website=pump-zone.com |language=en-gb}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=John Crane Seal Sentinel - John Crane Increases Production Capabilities with Machine that Streamlines Four Machining Functions into One |url=http://www.sealsentinel.com/interphex/Day1-Story2.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127044346/http://www.sealsentinel.com/interphex/Day1-Story2.html |archive-date=2010-11-27 |access-date=2025-06-23 |website=www.sealsentinel.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Vacuum pump new on SA market |url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/vacuum-pump-new-on-sa-market-2005-04-22 |access-date=2025-06-23 |website=Engineering News}}</ref> Edit summary (Briefly describe your changes) By publishing changes, you agree to the Terms of Use , and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and the GFDL .
