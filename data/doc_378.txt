Since 2020, it is positioned between the Yaris Cross and Corolla Cross in Toyota's crossover SUV range. The first-generation C-HR was available in many regions, including Japan, China, North America, Europe, Southeast Asia, and Australia, and was produced in four countries. Since the release of the second-generation C-HR in 2023, availability of the C-HR has been limited to Europe and Australia, with production centralised in Turkey. The Corolla Cross, released in 2020, has largely taken over the model's positioning outside Europe.

Toyota C-HR Concept Toyota C-HR Concept Production model [ edit ] Toyota presented the production C-HR at the March 2016 Geneva Motor Show and started production in November 2016. It was launched in Japan on 14 December 2016. [ 5 ] It went on sale in Europe, Australia, South Africa and North America in early 2017, and in Southeast Asia, China and Taiwan in 2018. The name C-HR can stand for either Compact High Rider , [ 5 ] Cross Hatch Run–about [ 5 ] or Coupe High Rider . [ 6 ] The development of the car began in 2013, led by Toyota chief engineer Hiroyuki Koba, [ 7 ] sharing the TNGA-C (GA-C) platform with the E210 series Corolla . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] Initial production was in Japan and Turkey. The 2018–2020 model year North American-spec C-HR is imported from Turkey.

The Japanese market C-HR is powered by either 1.2-litre turbocharged petrol engine, or 1.8-litre Hybrid. The FWD models are available with both engines, while the only engine for the AWD models is the 1.2-litre turbo. Model grades are S, S-LED, G, S-T and G-T. Models S, S-LED, G are powered with a 1.2-litre turbo engine, while other models by a 1.8-litre Hybrid. LED Package is exclusive for the G and S-LED packages. Asia [ edit ] "Toyota C-HR EV" redirects here; not to be confused with Toyota C-HR+ . The Thai-built C-HR with 1.8-litre 2ZR-FBE or 2ZR-FE engine is sold in certain Asian countries such as Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia and Brunei. The ASEAN production version was unveiled in Thailand on 30 November 2017, at the 34th Thailand International Motor Expo. [ citation needed ] For the Indonesian market, the C-HR was launched on 10 April 2018, initially with a 1.8-litre 2ZR-FE petrol engine. The hybrid variant followed later on 22 April 2019. The petrol variant was discontinued in March 2022. The remaining sole hybrid variant received Toyota Safety Sense on 27 May 2022 and sold until May 2023. [ citation needed ] In Brunei, the C-HR was launched in early 2018 and offered in the mid and high grade models with a petrol engine, and a hybrid model. It was discontinued in 2022. [ citation needed ] For Taiwan, the C-HR is only offered with 1.2-litre 8NR-FTS petrol engine. Buyers in Taiwan can choose the FWD and AWD models. [ citation needed ] In Singapore, it received the FWD model in Active and Luxury grades by the local distributor with the 1.2-litre engine while hybrid 1.8-litre models are offered by parallel importers. [ citation needed ] For the Chinese market, the C-HR is sold by GAC Toyota , while its twin model sold by FAW Toyota is called the IZOA ( Chinese : 奕泽 ; pinyin : Yìzé ). The IZOA features a front bumper grille with horizontal lines instead of mesh on the C-HR. Both the C-HR and IZOA were revealed at the Auto Guangzhou in November 2017 and went on sale in April 2018. The electric vehicle (EV) variant of both the C-HR and IZOA were unveiled at the 18th Auto Shanghai on 16 April 2019, as the first battery electric vehicle in Toyota's upcoming lineup. [ 11 ] The C-HR EV went on sale in China in April 2020. The electric motor produces 150 kW (201 hp; 204 PS) and 300 N⋅m (220 lb⋅ft) of torque. The 54.3 kWh lithium-ion battery pack is claimed to deliver a range of up to 400 km (250 miles) as per NEDC. [ 12 ] In late 2020, the comparatively expensive (being a fully imported model from Thailand) C-HR was discontinued in Malaysia, leading to declining sales. It was replaced by the Corolla Cross , launched in late March 2021. [ 13 ] Europe [ edit ] As in Japan, the C-HR for Europe can be purchased with either 1.2-litre turbocharged petrol, a 1.8-litre hybrid or with 2.0-litre hybrid. 6-speed manual transmission is only installed in the front-wheel-drive 1.2-litre turbo; the sole gearbox for the 1.2-litre turbo AWD and the hybrid is a CVT . Trim levels vary across countries. In the UK, they are Icon, Design, Excel and Dynamic. For the French market, there are even more marketing name variations such as Active, Dynamic, Edition, Graphic, Distinctive and Collection. In Romania there are C-enter, C-ult Style and C-lassy. They are essentially similar cars with different standards or optional equipment. Australia [ edit ] For the Australian market (imported from Japan), the C-HR is only offered with the 1.2-litre, 8NR-FTS turbo motor. The base model is available in manual transmission as a FWD only, automatic transmission models may be FWD or AWD. The high level Koba model is available in both FWD and AWD variants. The gearbox for the base model is a choice of 6-speed manual transmission or CVT with 7-speed simulated gear. The Koba comes with CVT only, and is equipped with LED headlights, leather seats, heated front seats, and smart entry and start system. [ 14 ] North America [ edit ] Unique for the North American C-HR is the larger 2.0-litre 3ZR-FAE naturally aspirated petrol engine which is matched to a CVT gearbox. In North America, the C-HR was originally planned to be marketed under the Scion brand, before Toyota discontinued the marque. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] The 2018 model year was  available in either the XLE or XLE Premium trim levels. [ 17 ] Beginning with the 2019 model year, the C-HR wass available in LE, XLE, XLE Premium or Limited trim levels. [ 18 ] The C-HR was discontinued in North America after the 2022 model year, [ 19 ] where Toyota elected not to market the subsequent, second-generation C-HR, and the Corolla Cross continued as the brand's subcompact crossover/SUV. [ 20 ] Facelift [ edit ] The facelifted C-HR was unveiled in Japan, Europe, Australia, and North America in October 2019. The European model received the 2.0-litre M20A-FXS hybrid engine option for the first time. Android Auto and Apple CarPlay became standard. The GR Sport variant is also offered.

[ 28 ] The second iteration of the C-HR was revealed on 26 June 2023, and officially launched in October 2023. It receives two-tone paint, with a sharper, sleeker body compared to the previous model. [ 29 ] [ 30 ] The C-HR now features the new design language of Toyota, with C-shaped headlights that can be found on the Prius XW60 and the Aygo X Concept . Based on the previous model, it features similar features from it such as its hatchback body style, its platform , and similar models. Now exclusively on a hybrid drivetrain , it introduces a plug-in hybrid option for the first time, though the PHEV will not be sold in Australia. [ 31 ] With the same wheelbase as the previous model, the base models receive a 8.0-inch console display with higher end models including a dual 12.3-inch infotainment screen. The C-HR receives an upgrade in technology compared to the previous model, including a digital key, advanced safety systems, a remote parking option, and a hands-free driving system in traffic jams. [ 32 ] The range consisted of the Hybrid 140, Hybrid 200, Hybrid 200 AWD-i, and the Plug-In Hybrid 220 AWD. The AWD versions have a compact electric motor on the rear axle which provides more power and torque for better traction and stability. Frequency Sensitive Control (FSC) is used to enhance handling and comfort. This hydro-mechanical system increases damping force at low frequencies to deliver superior body control, in roll and pitch, as well as maintaining better control during cornering. Reduced damping at high frequency further improves ride comfort. This feature is installed in the C-HR Plug-In Hybrid and GR Sport Premiere Edition. [ 33 ] The C-HR GR Sport features 20-inch wheels with a all-wheel drive (AWD) system using the brand's E-four 4WD system. It has 2 electric motors with a power output of 145 kW (194 hp). The new C-HR is no longer built in Japan; instead it is built exclusively in Turkey, at Toyota's Turkish plant . [ 28 ] This generation is not sold in North America, Japan, China and Southeast Asia. In those markets, the C-HR has been replaced with the Corolla Cross , which is a C-segment vehicle and is about 100 mm (3.9 in) longer.
