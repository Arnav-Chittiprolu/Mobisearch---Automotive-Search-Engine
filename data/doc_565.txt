From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Motor vehicle Chevrolet Omega Chevrolet Omega B (VX) in a Brazilian presidential convoy Overview Manufacturer Chevrolet ( General Motors ) (1992–1998) Holden ( General Motors ) (1998–2008, 2010–2011) Production 1992–2008 2010–2011 Body and chassis Class Executive car Chronology Predecessor Chevrolet Opala The Chevrolet Omega is an executive car sold by Chevrolet for the Brazilian market.  Replacing the Chevrolet Opala , which was a development of the Opel Rekord C, the original Chevrolet Omega was based on the Opel Omega A and built locally between 1992 and 1998.  From 1998 to 2011, after local production ceased, General Motors do Brasil imported badge engineered versions of the Holden Commodore from Australia.

From 1995, following the discontinuation of Omega A in Germany, the engines were upgraded to a 2.2-liter four (GLS) and a 4.1 L (250 cu in) Chevrolet straight-six engine (CD) as used in the previous GM Opala albeit tuned by Lotus and with electronic multiport fuel injection added. [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 3 ] Both sedan and station wagon (called Omega Suprema) body styles were available. The station wagon shared the exact powertrain configuration and trim options with the sedan versions. Some funeral parlor owners chose the Omega Suprema as their preferred car for hearse-based modifications. In addition to the bigger engines, suited to local gasoline quality, General Motors do Brasil had also deemed it necessary to beef up the suspension of the Omega to deal with Brazilian road conditions. [ 4 ] The CD version was offered the availability of the 4L30-E automatic transmission as an option. Chevrolet Omega A Stock Car (1994) Chevrolet Omega A (rear) Powertrain: Engine Cyl.
