From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 1930s Japanese radial aircraft engine Kinsei Type Radial engine National origin Japan Manufacturer Mitsubishi Heavy Industries First run 1932 Major applications Aichi D3A Yokosuka D4Y3-D4Y4 Kawasaki Ki-100 Number built 12,228 Developed from Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet Developed into Mitsubishi Shinten , Mitsubishi Zuisei , Mitsubishi Kasei , Ha-43 (Ha-211) The Mitsubishi Kinsei ( 金星 , Venus ) was a 14-cylinder, air-cooled, twin-row radial aircraft engine developed by Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan in 1934 for the Imperial Japanese Navy . The Mitsubishi model designation for this engine was A8 while it was an experimental project; in service, it was known as the MK8 "Kinsei" by the Navy. In 1941 the engine was adopted by Army, receiving designation Ha-112 [ 1 ] (later Ha-112-I, 1,300hp Army Type 1 ). In May 1943 it received Ha-33 unified designation code . [ 2 ] Design and development [ edit ] Early Kinsei models (1 and 2) had A4 internal designation and their cylinder and detail design was based on the single-row, 9-cylinder air-cooled Pratt and Whitney R-1690 Hornet . [ 3 ] In 1933 engine underwent a major redesign and redesignated A8 . Head layout was reversed to allow exhaust exit to the rear, reducing back-pressure and allowing for a cleaner installation. Compression ratio increased from 5.3:1 to 6.0:1. These changes resulted in a significant performance uplift, compared to previous variants. [ 4 ] Kinsei 41 saw ever further increase in compression ratio from 6.0:1 to 6.6:1, and a larger supercharger . It's also the first variant to receive a two-digit model numbers. 40 series remained in production from 1936 till the end of the war. Kinsei 50 series saw the final compression ratio increase to 7.0:1. Indirect fuel injection was fitted as well as a larger two-speed supercharger. Kinsei 60 series was introduction of direct injection and later, a turbo-supercharger . Its development was run parallel to 50 series. Production started in 1940 and lasted till the end of the war.
