The XC60 is part of Volvo's 60 Series of automobiles, along with the S60 , S60 Cross Country , V60 , and V60 Cross Country . The first generation model introduced a new style for the 60 Series models. Along with the rest of the line-up, the first-generation XC60 was refreshed in 2013. Similarly, the second-generation model, released in 2017, is the first in the series. [ 1 ] The car was named Car of the Year Japan for 2017–2018. XC60 concept (2007) [ edit ] The XC60 concept was unveiled at the 2007 Detroit Auto Show . [ 2 ] It included a glass roof and a newly styled grille. The model introduced Volvo's new styling cues, which were gradually implemented throughout the model range. The XC60 concept also included a new shifting mechanism, electronic bootlid, and 20-inch wheels.

[ 9 ] Sales began in Europe in the third quarter of 2008 and in North America in early 2009 as a 2010 model. [ 10 ] [ 11 ] The XC60 has been Volvo's best selling car since 2009. [ 12 ] Manufactured by subsidiary Volvo Car Gent in Ghent , Belgium , the first generation XC60 is based on Volvo's P3 platform and the XC60 shares technology with the Land Rover Freelander of 2007. At the time of development, both Land Rover and Volvo were owned by Ford and development was split between the two subsidiaries. Much of the engineering and tuning of the crossover was done by Volvo in Sweden, although offroad capabilities were developed at Land Rover in England. In April 2010, an R-Design variant of the XC60 became available, featuring a colour-matching body kit, stiffer chassis and damping, and other unique exterior/interior trim. In February 2013, Volvo debuted a refreshed version of the XC60, to be released for the 2014 model year. Exterior updates are primarily cosmetic, with changes to the grille and front driving lights, loss of black cladding along the lower doorsills, and minor changes to the exhaust tips and taillights. Interior updates include new materials and dashboard trims, available paddle shifter on the T6 model, and introduction of a 7" display.

[ 14 ] XC60 Plug-in Hybrid Concept [ edit ] The Volvo XC60 plug-in hybrid concept was unveiled at the 2012 North American International Auto Show . The powertrain mated a 270 hp (201 kW; 274 PS) turbocharged 4-cylinder driving the front wheels with a 70 hp (52 kW; 71 PS) electric motor driving the rear wheels, giving the powertrain a peak combined output of 350 hp (261 kW; 355 PS). [ 15 ] According to Volvo, the XC60 Plug-in Hybrid has an all-electric range of up to 35 mi (56 km) for a fuel economy equivalent of 105 mpg ‑US (2.2 L/100 km; 126 mpg ‑imp ) and a total range of 600 mi (970 km). Fuel economy when running on the gasoline engine is estimated at 50 mpg ‑US (4.7 L/100 km; 60 mpg ‑imp ). Recharging time is 3.5 hours from a 220 V outlet and 7.5 hours from a 110 V outlet. [ 16 ] [ 17 ] The model was never released for production.

The XC60 also introduced a new technology feature that Volvo has named City safety . The system is described as a driver support system with the goal of preventing or mitigating vehicle-on-vehicle collisions below 30 km/h (19 mph); it does so through the use of a closing velocity sensor that helps determine whether a collision is likely. Depending on the speed, if a collision is likely, the Volvo's computer system will either prepare the car to brake or automatically brake the vehicle to avoid or mitigate a rear-end collision . [ 50 ] In 2011, the Highway Loss Data Institute credited City Safety for 27% fewer property damage liability claims, 51% fewer bodily injury liability claims, and 22% fewer collision claims for the XC60 compared to other midsize luxury SUVs. The XC60 had fewer insurance claims compared to other Volvo models lacking the City Safety feature. [ 51 ] Euro NCAP evaluated the XC60 in 2008, awarding it 5 of 5 stars for adult occupant protection. The XC60 scored 16 of 16 points in the front test and 16 of 16 in the side test. The car received 2 of 2 points available in the pole test and an additional 3 points available for seat belt reminders. The XC60 received a total of 37 of 37 points and therefore five stars (33–37) in Euro NCAP's evaluation. [ 52 ] The XC60 was one of only three cars to receive 37 of 37 available points under Euro NCAP's point based evaluation at the time. The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety awarded the Volvo XC60 their Top Safety Pick+ award. The XC60 was granted the IIHS's highest rating of "good" in front, side, rear and roof strength tests and has Electronic Stability Control as standard equipment to receive the award.

The first −60 series model in its generation and the first since Volvo's purchase by Geely, it is based on the same Scalable Product Architecture (SPA) platform as the S90, V90, and XC90. As part of Volvo's move toward smaller engines, the new model uses only four-cylinder engines, in various configurations and states of tune, again shared with the −90 series models. [ 66 ] The car was facelifted on 2 March 2021, with the new version debuting alongside the Volvo C40 . The engines remain the same 2.0 litre with petrol, diesel, or PHEV power. Like the XC40 Recharge Electric and the C40, the XC60 facelift also gains a new Android-powered infotainment system that's been developed in collaboration with Google. [ citation needed ] The 2024 Volvo XC60, which fell short of the Top Safety Pick+ award, received an “acceptable” rating in the updated side-impact test. The possible injuries recorded on the dummies that simulated the vehicle's occupants, especially the driver and rear passenger, were the determining factor in this rating.

Pre-delivery, with some protective film in place. Mild hybrid [ edit ] The XC60 was released with two mild hybrid variants in 2020, with both a petrol and diesel 2.0L variant available. They utilize an Integrated Starter Generator (ISG) and a KERS system [ 69 ] In 2023, Volvo removed conventional engines as an option, meaning mild hybrids are the base engine option in the US. [ 70 ] Plug-in hybrid [ edit ] The XC60 was released with a T8 plug-in hybrid variant that used the T6 engine combined with a 10.4 kWh battery (9.2 kWh usable) and an 87 hp (65 kW; 88 PS) rear electric motor to produce 407 hp (303 kW; 413 PS). The EPA all-electric range is 18 miles (29 km). [ 71 ] For the 2020 model year, the battery size was increased to 11.6 kWh, which increased the EPA range to 19 miles (31 km). [ 72 ] For the 2021 model year, T8 models were renamed to "Recharge" models. For the 2022 model year, Volvo released an XC60 Recharge Extended Range. Battery size was increased to 18.7 kWh (14.8 kWh usable), increasing the all-electric range to 77 kilometres (48 mi). The rear electric motor was upgraded to a 142 hp (106 kW; 144 PS) unit, increasing total power output to 455 hp (339 kW; 461 PS). [ 73 ] Facelift (2025) [ edit ] In August 2025, a facelift version of the second-generation XC60 was launched. Exterior revisions included a redesigned front grille with a criss-cross mesh pattern, smoked-effect LED tail lamps, and newly designed 19-inch alloy wheels. [ 74 ] [ 75 ] Interior updates featured a larger 11.2-inch touchscreen infotainment system, an upgraded digital instrument cluster, and new upholstery options such as Nordico synthetic leather. In the Indian market, the facelifted model was offered in a single fully equipped Ultra trim, which added features including a front seat massage function and additional soft-touch materials and the price increased to : ₹ 71.9 Lakhs which was : ₹ 1.15 Lakhs more than the pre-facelift model. [ 76 ] [ 77 ] [ 78 ] [ 79 ] No mechanical changes were introduced with the update. The model continued to be powered by a 2.0-litre turbocharged petrol engine paired with a 48V mild-hybrid system , producing 250 hp and 360 Nm of torque. An 8-speed automatic transmission and all-wheel drive remained standard across the range. Plug-in hybrid variants retained their pre-facelift powertrain specifications.
