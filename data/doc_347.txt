Marketed as the "Triple Economy" series, the second-generation F-Series again encompassed a comprehensive range of vehicles, ranging from light-duty pickup trucks to heavy-duty commercial vehicles. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] This generation saw a revision to the F-Series model nomenclature, shifting from a one-digit model number to a three-digit number; F-100 to F-350. This system has remained in use on all Ford F-Series trucks to the present day. Alongside the naming change, this generation marked several firsts for the F-Series, including an adjustable seat (wide enough for three people), [ 6 ] power brakes, [ 7 ] [ 8 ] and the introduction of the Ford-O-Matic automatic transmission as an option. In line with Ford cars, seat belts were introduced as an option for 1956. [ 3 ] The second-generation F-Series was produced by Ford at eleven facilities across the United States; Ford Canada marketed the model line under both the F-Series and the Mercury M-Series nameplates. Ford of Brazil inaugurated local production with the model line, producing it from 1957 to 1962. Model overview [ edit ] In its redesign of the Ford F-Series, Ford set out to upgrade the capability of the vehicle line. Along with increasing payload capacity, designers redesigned the suspension to improve steering control. [ 9 ] The cab was widened, bringing a larger windshield and rear window. [ 10 ] Shortened to a 110-inch wheelbase (from 114 inches), the front axle was moved rearward to further improve turning radius and lower the hoodline. [ 11 ] A 20-inch-deep cargo bed was introduced; though the width would change, the depth remained the same through the seventh-generation F-Series of 1980. [ 9 ] 1953 [ edit ] Distinguished by a two-bar grille, the 1953 F-Series internally denoted the 50th anniversary of Ford Motor Company with a commemorative emblem on the steering wheel horn button. [ 9 ] Alongside a completely redesigned chassis and body, the engine line was in transition, carrying over the 101 hp (75 kW) inline-6 as the standard engine with the optional 100 hp (75 kW) Flathead V8 . In a one-year-only combination, the Flathead V8 was offered with the newly optional Ford-O-Matic transmission.

[ 10 ] The powertrain lineup saw further change; along with a newly enlarged 223 cubic-inch inline-6 base engine (increased to 115 hp), [ 12 ] the Flathead V8 (which made its debut in the 1939 Mercury) was discontinued. Again using a 239 cubic-inch displacement, the overhead-valve 130 hp Y-Block V8 brought a significant increase in power output. [ 9 ] The availability of Ford-O-Matic was expanded from the F-100 to F-250 and F-350 trucks. [ 12 ] 1955 [ edit ] For 1955, a double-bar grille returned, distinguished with a center notch (for the V8 emblem) and revised hood emblems. Tubeless tires were introduced as an option. [ 13 ] The Custom Cab was introduced, grouping multiple upgraded interior options in a single option package. [ 9 ] [ 13 ] 1956 update [ edit ] For its final year of production, the second-generation F-Series received a redesign of the cab, adopting a vertical A-pillar and wraparound windshield; a rarely-seen option included a wraparound rear window. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] [ 14 ] While the cab saw significant change, the front bodywork remained largely unchanged, with only minor changes to the grille. Several functional changes were introduced for 1956, with the F-Series adopting electric (instead of vacuum-powered) windshield wipers , tubeless tires (on models above the F-100), and a 12-volt electric system. [ 15 ] A deep-dish "Lifeguard" steering wheel was standard, while seatbelts were offered as an option. [ 9 ] [ 15 ] After an initial increase to 256 cubic inches for 1955, the Y-block was enlarged to 272 cubic inches for 1956; three versions were offered, producing up to 167 hp. [ 9 ] [ 15 ] Powertrain details [ edit ] The 1954 F-100 was the last year for the flathead engine in the U.S. Models in Canada , including the Mercury M-Series , continued to use the flathead. 1954–55 saw the introduction of the new 239 CID overhead valve Y-block V8, dubbed "Power King." The six-cylinder engine's displacement was also increased, from 215 to 223 CID, and power steering was introduced as an option. In the succeeding years, the 239 Y-block was replaced with the 256, 272, and 317 engines for medium- and heavy-duty variants. With pickup trucks, the standard transmission was a 3-speed column-shifted synchronized manual; optional transmissions included a 3-speed manual with overdrive and a 4-speed manual (with low first gear). A Ford-O-Matic 3-speed automatic transmission was also optional.

As of current production, Ford still uses this nomenclature on its F-Series trucks today, with minor revisions (the F-100 was replaced entirely by the F-150 and medium-duty trucks now use the F-x50 designation). This nomenclature is also currently used by the Ford E-Series and (in North America) by its Ford Transit successor. Among F-Series pickup truck lines, the 1 ⁄ 2 -ton F-1 became the F-100 , the F-2 and F-3 were consolidated into the 3 ⁄ 4 -ton F-250 , with the F-4 becoming the 1-ton F-350 . The medium-duty F-5 ( 1 + 1 ⁄ 2 -ton) and F-6 (2-ton) became the F-500 and F-600 , respectively. The heavy-duty F-7, F-8, and F-9 "Big Job" trucks became the F-700 , F-750 , F-800 , and F-900 series. For 1956, lower-GVWR versions of the F-100 and the F-250 were introduced (under the F-110 and F-260 model codes). [ 3 ] Variants [ edit ] Alongside the medium-duty and Big Job F-Series conventional-cab trucks, Ford sold the C-Series COE, configured with a raised cab and shortened hood. This would be the final generation of the C-Series based on the F-Series trucks, as Ford introduced the tilt-cab Ford C-Series for 1957; the model line was produced in a single generation until 1990. The B-Series was a cowled chassis derived from the F-500 through F-750; though typically used for school buses, the platform was also used to underpin other conventional-type buses as well. [ 16 ] Alongside its pickup truck body, the F-100 was also produced as a panel truck (a precursor to the E-Series van) and as a chassis-cab truck.
