The third all- aluminum engine of Hyundai Motor Company debuted in the fourth-generation Hyundai Sonata sedan (codenamed NF), which was unveiled in August 2004 in South Korea . [ 1 ] Hyundai Motor Manufacturing Alabama (HMMA) built a Theta II engine shop on the grounds of their Montgomery, Alabama automobile factory. Global Engine Alliance [ edit ] Main article: Global Engine Alliance The Global Engine Alliance was a joint venture between Chrysler , Mitsubishi Motors , and the Hyundai Motor Company for developing a line of shared four-cylinder engines. Each manufacturer configured their variants of the initial design differently based on their needs. In 2009, Chrysler bought out Mitsubishi and Hyundai's stake in the joint-venture; however, each company retained rights to build the engines. Technical details [ edit ] Theta [ edit ] The engine features hollow stainless-steel dual overhead camshafts ( DOHC ) with powder-metal cam lobes, pent-roof combustion chambers and shimless bucket tappets in the cylinder head. BorgWarner Morse TEC supplies the complete timing system which uses the company's proprietary silent timing chains. Continuously variable valve timing (CVVT) works on the intake side. The aluminum alloy engine block, which is formed using a high-pressure die-cast method, has a unique Metaldyne -supplied cassette-type balance shaft module with a two-stage oil pump built-in. In the lower-end, the block is reinforced by a ladder frame. Other notable features include fracture-split sinter-forged connecting rods manufactured by Sinteron and a stainless-steel exhaust manifold . Theta's EMS ( engine management system ) software is EMS-II from Siemens VDO and the 32-bit PCM (Powertrain Control Module) calculates the amount of intake air by utilizing a contamination-proof hot-film type MAF ( mass air flow ) sensor. The first version of the Theta Engine had three variants, 1.8L, 2.0L and 2.4L. 1.8L (G4KB) [ edit ] The 1.8L version is an inline 4-cylinder engine that carries a 10.5:1 compression ratio; the engine makes 133–138 PS (98–101 kW; 131–136 hp) at 6,000–6,200 rpm and 16.9–17.5 kg⋅m (122–127 lb⋅ft; 166–172 N⋅m) of torque at 4,250 rpm.

Applications Hyundai Starex (2008–2021) Engine recall [ edit ] Hyundai and Kia vehicles equipped with Theta II engines (GDI) were recalled, due to the fact that those engines were, and continue to be, the subject of an investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). Safety regulators are investigating if Hyundai and Kia did enough in a timely manner with regards to the recalls of nearly 1.7 million vehicles with Theta engines, which were prone to an abnormal amount of noise and seizing. In September 2015, Hyundai recalled about 470,000 model year 2011-2012 Sonatas equipped with 2-liter and 2.4-liter Theta II engines. At the time, Hyundai told NHTSA that manufacturing problems left metallic debris around the engine crankshaft, causing problems with oil flow. The pieces of metal interfere with the oil flow through the connecting rod bearings and damage the connecting rods. The automaker blamed the problem on a mechanical "deburring" process used to remove metallic machining debris from the crankshaft. [ 3 ] By April 2017, Hyundai expanded the 2015 recall by including another 572,000 vehicles with Theta II engines, including 2013-2014 Hyundai Sonata and Santa Fe Sport vehicles. [ 4 ] Hyundai told safety regulators the same metal debris problem caused the expanded recall. Near that same time, Kia told NHTSA about a recall of more than 618,000 model year 2011-2014 Kia Optima, 2012-2014 Sorento and 2011-2013 Sportage vehicles because the Theta engine bearings wore out too early and caused the engines to seize. [ 5 ] Kia said it didn't recall the vehicles in 2015 when Hyundai first recalled its cars because the Theta II engines in the Kia vehicles were built on a different production line and had different problems than Hyundai. In addition to customers complaining about the Theta II engines, a Korean whistleblower who worked for Hyundai as an engineer let NHTSA know what he knew. [ 6 ] Also in April 2017, Hyundai and Kia Motors planned to recall 170,000 vehicles in South Korea from five models, including their Grandeur and Sonata, after acknowledging a defect in the Theta 2 engines used in them. [ 7 ] Eventually, 520,000 vehicles were recalled in South Korea. [ 8 ] Owners started suing after the automaker refused to pay the thousands of dollars to repair or replace the engines, with one lawsuit from 2015 alleging a dealer wanted $4,500 to do the work.  Kia was also served papers over a class-action lawsuit in 2016 filed by owners of vehicles equipped with Theta engines. NHTSA says it took action to "investigate both the timeliness and scope of Hyundai's Theta II engine recalls, and Hyundai's compliance with reporting requirements." [ 9 ] In Canada in 2019 Hyundai announced a recall for most vehicles using the affected engines, [ 10 ] however a class action lawsuit was filed in 2018 as a result of failures of this engine used in Canadian Forte models and lack of manufacturer support against Kia Canada Inc. [ 11 ] On December 1, 2020, Hyundai and Kia recalled 423,000 vehicles equipped with various engines following a joint review by Hyundai and the NHTSA, of which the 2.4L Theta II MPI engines were a part of. This marks the first instance of the MPI variants of these engines being recalled. Affected vehicles include the 2011-2013 Hyundai Sonata Hybrid, 2012 Hyundai Santa Fe, [ 12 ] 2012-2013 Kia Sorento, 2011-2013 Kia Optima Hybrid, 2012-2013 Kia Forte and Forte Koup, and the 2012 Kia Sportage 2.4l. [ 13 ] Crate engines [ edit ] On 2013-11-05, Hyundai announced the creation of a new factory crate engine program at the 2013 SEMA Show in Las Vegas, which initially included a 2.0-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder engine. The crate engine program began in December 2013.
