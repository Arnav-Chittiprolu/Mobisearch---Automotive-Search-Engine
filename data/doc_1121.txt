The F20/F21 generation was produced by BMW from 2011 to 2019 and is often collectively referred to as the F20. For the second generation of 1 Series, the coupé and convertible models marketed separately using the new BMW 2 Series nameplate. The F20/F21 was initially powered by inline-four petrol, inline-four diesel and inline-six petrol engines. In 2015, inline-three petrol and diesel engines were added to the model range. All engines are turbocharged . Unlike most hatchback competitors, the F20/F21 uses a rear-wheel drive (rather than front-wheel drive) for most models. The F20/F21 is the first 1 Series to offer an optional all-wheel drive (called " xDrive " by BMW). In July 2019, the BMW 1 Series (F40) began production as the successor to the F20. [ 5 ] Equipment [ edit ] Interior Available equipment includes satellite navigation with an 8.8-inch screen, iDrive , LED headlights and digital radio. [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The interior and exterior trim is either Sport Line , Urban Line or M Sport . These trim packages differ by alloy wheels, kidney grille, FDS, and other appearance-related features. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In November 2015, the optional Automatic parking (called "Parking Assistant", where the car steers itself to parallel park) was upgraded. [ 11 ] 114-125 models with the M Sport trim and M Performance models can be fitted with M Performance Parts. These include black kidney grilles, sport brakes for 18 inch and higher wheels, side skirt ground effects, carbon fibre mirrors and an M Performance silencer system for the M135i and M140i.
