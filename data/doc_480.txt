The Audi emblem is four overlapping rings that represent the four [[marque]]s of Auto Union. The Audi emblem symbolises the amalgamation of Audi with DKW, Horch and Wanderer: the first ring from the left represents Audi, the second represents DKW, third is Horch, and the fourth and last ring Wanderer.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.carlogo.info/audi-audi-logo_blog-bid-29.htm| title= Audi Logo| author= Car Logo| access-date= 10 September 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930100058/http://www.carlogo.info/audi-audi-logo_blog-bid-29.htm| archive-date= 30 September 2007 | url-status= usurped| df= dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.seriouswheels.com/art-four-rings-1.htm |title=History of the Four Rings-Part 1-Audi Auto Union |publisher=Seriouswheels.com |access-date=27 April 2009}}</ref> The design is popularly believed to have been the idea of [[Klaus von Oertzen]], the director of sales at [[Wanderer (car)|Wanderer]]—when [[Berlin]] was chosen as the host city for the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] and that a form of the Olympic logo symbolized the newly established Auto Union's desire to succeed.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Harris|first1=Paul|title=Audi: Sutton's Photographic History of Transport|date=25 May 1999|publisher=Sutton Publishing|isbn=978-0750919258|page=84}}</ref> Somewhat ironically, the [[International Olympic Committee]] later sued Audi in the International Trademark Court in 1995, where they lost.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.autoevolution.com/news/audi-reveals-updated-logo-10315.html |title=Audi Reveals Updated Logo |access-date=27 August 2009 |first=Alina|last=Dumitrache |publisher=autoevolution.com|date=27 August 2009 }}</ref>

The original "Audi" script, with the distinctive slanted tails on the "A" and "d" was created for the historic Audi company in 1920 by the famous graphic designer [[Lucian Bernhard]], and was resurrected when Volkswagen revived the brand in 1965. Following the demise of NSU in 1977, less prominence was given to the four rings, in preference to the "Audi" script encased within a black (later red) ellipse, and was commonly displayed next to the Volkswagen roundel when the two brands shared a dealer network under the '''V.A.G''' banner. The ellipse (known as the Audi Oval) was phased out after 1994, when Audi formed its own independent dealer network, and prominence was given back to the four rings—at the same time Audi Sans (a derivative of [[Univers]]) was adopted as the font for all marketing materials, corporate communications and was also used in the vehicles themselves.

As part of Audi's centennial celebration in 2009, the company updated the logo, changing the [[font]] to left-aligned Audi Type, and altering the shading for the overlapping rings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wot.motortrend.com/6546262/marketing/audi-unveils-updated-logo-following-centennial-celebration/index.html |title=Audi Unveils Updated Logo Following Centennial Celebration |publisher=Wot.motortrend.com |access-date=2 August 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100809114134/http://wot.motortrend.com/6546262/marketing/audi-unveils-updated-logo-following-centennial-celebration/index.html| archive-date= 9 August 2010 |url-status = live}}</ref> The revised logo was designed by Rayan Abdullah.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mosul-network.org/index.php?do=article&id=18707 |title=mosul-network.org |publisher=mosul-network.org |date=20 January 2011 |access-date=18 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727095044/http://www.mosul-network.org/index.php?do=article&id=18707 |archive-date=27 July 2011 }}</ref>

Audi developed a Corporate Sound concept, with Audi Sound Studio designed for producing the Corporate Sound.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://audio-branding-academy.org/aba/congress/2k10/program-2010/audi-corporate-sound/|title=Audi Corporate Sound|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref> The Corporate Sound project began with sound agency Klangerfinder GmbH & Co KG and s12 GmbH.

Audi started using a beating heart sound trademark beginning in 1996. An updated heartbeat sound logo, developed by agencies KLANGERFINDER GmbH & Co KG of Stuttgart and S12 GmbH of Munich, was first used in 2010 in an [[Audi A8]] commercial with the slogan ''The Art of Progress''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://audiusanews.com/newsrelease.do;jsessionid=6B7C3D245D0FFFC5A8563D0862FE4948?&id=1865&allImage=1&teaser=new-audi-heartbeat&mid=19|title=The new Audi heartbeat |publisher=Audi of America|date=9 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/carros/WmX9Ft92s9yydQy7TX9YDKACypSGLlNnSGbucb0f6XxPiXZyFQD7m1b3yi5h/Audi_Corporate_Sound.pdf |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20221009/http://posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/carros/WmX9Ft92s9yydQy7TX9YDKACypSGLlNnSGbucb0f6XxPiXZyFQD7m1b3yi5h/Audi_Corporate_Sound.pdf |archive-date=9 October 2022 |url-status=live|title=Good night, Posterous|access-date=14 July 2015}}</ref>

====Slogans====
Audi's corporate [[tagline]] is {{lang|de|Vorsprung durch Technik}} {{IPA|de|ˈfoːɐ̯ˌʃpʁʊŋ dʊʁç ˈtɛçnɪk|}}, meaning 'Progress through Technology'.<ref>{{Cite journal | title = Eco-Culture | journal=Audi Magazine | issue = 3/08 | page = 19}}</ref> The German-language tagline is used in many European countries, including the United Kingdom (but not in Italy, where {{lang|it|All'avanguardia della tecnica}} is used), and in other markets, such as Latin America, Oceania, Africa and parts of Asia including Japan. Originally, the American tagline was ''Innovation through technology'', but in Canada ''Vorsprung durch Technik'' was used. Since 2007, Audi has used the slogan ''Truth in Engineering'' in the U.S.<ref>Lavrinc, Damon. [http://www.autoblog.com/2008/04/08/audi-planning-tt-and-r8-lightweight-sport-models/ Audi planning TT and R8 lightweight "Sport" models]. ''[[Autoblog.com|Autoblog]]''. Retrieved 24 April 2010.</ref> However, since the [[Volkswagen emissions violations|Audi emissions testing scandal]] came to light in September 2015, this slogan was lambasted for being discordant with reality.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Audi's 'Truth in Engineering' ads come back to bite amid probe| work=Automotive News |date = 21 September 2015|url = http://www.autonews.com/article/20150921/RETAIL03/309219887/audis-truth-in-engineering-ads-come-back-to-bite-amid-probe|access-date = 3 October 2015}}</ref> In fact, just hours after disgraced Volkswagen CEO [[Martin Winterkorn]] admitted to cheating on emissions data, an advertisement during the 2015 Primetime Emmy Awards promoted Audi's latest advances in low emissions technology with Kermit the Frog stating, "It's not that easy being green."<ref>{{Cite news|title = Audi Airs Mistimed 'Truth in Engineering' Ads|url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-09-21/audi-truth-in-engineering-ads-come-back-to-bite-amid-probe|publisher = Bloomberg L.P.|access-date = 3 October 2015|first = Alex|last = Webb|newspaper = Bloomberg.com|date = 21 September 2015}}</ref>

''Vorsprung durch Technik'' was first used in English-language advertising after Sir John Hegarty of the [[Bartle Bogle Hegarty]] advertising agency visited the Audi factory in 1982.<ref name="guardian-rice-oxley">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2012/sep/18/vorsprung-durch-technik-video|title=Vorsprung durch Technik: how a catchphrase was coined – video|work=The Guardian|date=18 September 2012|access-date=16 May 2013|first1=Mark|last1=Rice-Oxley|first2=Laurence|last2=Topham|first3=Ole|last3=Alsaker}}</ref> In the original British television commercials, the phrase was voiced by [[Geoffrey Palmer (actor)|Geoffrey Palmer]].<ref name="guardian-rice-oxley"/> After its repeated use in advertising campaigns, the phrase found its way into popular culture, including the British comedy ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', the [[U2]] song "[[Zooropa (song)|Zooropa]]"<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.u2.com/music/lyrics.php?song=91&list=z| title = Official U2 Website – Zooropa Lyrics}}</ref> and the ''[[Blur (Blur album)|Blur]]'' song "[[Parklife (song)|Parklife]]". Similar-sounding phrases have also been used, including as the punchline for a joke in the movie ''[[Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels]]'' and in the British TV series ''[[Peep Show (British TV series)|Peep Show]]''.

====Typography====
Audi Sans (based on [[Univers]] Extended) was originally created in 1997 by Ole Schäfer for [[MetaDesign]]. MetaDesign was later commissioned for a new corporate typeface called Audi Type, designed by Paul van der Laan and Pieter van Rosmalen of [[Bold Monday]]. The font began to appear in Audi's 2009 products and marketing materials.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boldmonday.com/en/audi |title=Bold Monday: Audi Type |publisher=boldmonday.com |access-date=6 October 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100901002038/http://www.boldmonday.com/en/audi| archive-date= 1 September 2010 |url-status = live}}</ref> Edit summary (Briefly describe your changes) By publishing changes, you agree to the Terms of Use , and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and the GFDL .
