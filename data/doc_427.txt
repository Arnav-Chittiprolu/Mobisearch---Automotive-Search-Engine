( January 2015 ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) ( Learn how and when to remove this message ) Automechanika is the world's biggest trade fair for the automobile aftermarket . It is held every two years (in even years) at the Messe Frankfurt . In distinction to the Motor Show , Automechanika is open to trading visitors only. History [ edit ] On 20 January 1971, the organizer of the Frankfurt Motor Show , the Association of the German Automobile Industry (Verband der Deutschen Automobilindustrie – VDA) canceled the show scheduled to be held the following September. According to the President of the Association, Dr. Johann Heinrich von Brunn, this was because the automobile industry needed to take cost-saving measures to counteract the high costs facing it. The cost of the exhibition – almost DM 100 million – was considered to be excessive in comparison to the business benefits. For the Frankfurt-based fair and exhibition company, Messe Frankfurt, cancellation would have meant a loss of at least DM 1.5 to 2 million in revenues. 
In mid-March 1971, Messe Frankfurt announced that a new event – Automechanika 71 – would be held instead of the Motor Show. The initiative for this came from the associations of the motor-vehicle and filling station and garage trades that still wanted to present their products. Manufacturers of automotive parts account for around 90 percent of exhibitors at the Frankfurt Motor Show. The first Automechanika was held from 18 to 26 September 1971 and attracted around 400 exhibitors and 75,000 visitors. [ 1 ] The fair was repeated in 1972 and held thereafter every two years in alternation with the Frankfurt Motor Show .
