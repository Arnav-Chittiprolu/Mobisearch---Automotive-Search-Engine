Website tesla .com /giga-texas Gigafactory Texas (also known as Giga Texas , Giga Austin , or Gigafactory 5 ) is a Tesla, Inc. automotive manufacturing facility in unincorporated Travis County, Texas , just outside of Austin . Construction began in July 2020, [ 2 ] limited production of Model Y began before the end of 2021, [ 3 ] [ 4 ] and initial deliveries of vehicles built at the factory took place at an opening party called "Cyber Rodeo" on April 7, 2022. [ 5 ] The factory produces Model Y cars for the Eastern United States and is also the main factory for the Cybertruck and the company's next-generation vehicle . [ 3 ] [ 6 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] It also serves as the site of Tesla's corporate headquarters. [ 9 ] It is the country's second biggest factory by size as well as the second-largest building by volume in the world after the Boeing Everett Factory , [ 10 ] Tesla originally planned to employ a staff of over 60,000 as production ramped up. [ 1 ] However, in 2024, approx. 2,700 employees (12% of the factory's workforce) were terminated in one of the largest layoffs in Austin history. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] History [ edit ] Selection process [ edit ] Tesla began considering locations across eight states in the central United States during 2019‒2020. [ 13 ] Community groups and government officials in several areas of the US expressed interest in hosting what was expected to be a very large Tesla Gigafactory manufacturing facility. [ 14 ] Some expressed interest in facilitating land procurement, getting over the regulatory obstacles , and considering potential tax incentives . [ 15 ] Some aimed to reach Elon Musk directly through social media marketing . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] By May 2020, a selection process was underway by Tesla. The short list included Austin, Nashville and Tulsa (Oklahoma) . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Two locations in the vicinity of Tulsa had been viewed by Tesla by mid-May. [ 20 ] The Tulsa campaign was promoted by G. T. Bynum , the mayor of Tulsa . In May 2020 Bynum discussed the suitability of " Green Country " (Northeastern Oklahoma) [ 20 ] and distributed a photomontage of the Cybertruck in Tulsa Police Department livery, with a suggestion of local purchasing , if the Gigafactory was to be situated near Tulsa. [ 21 ] On May 20, 2020, wrap advertising was applied to the Golden Driller statue located at the Tulsa Expo Center creating a caricature of Elon Musk , with the word "Tulsa" on statue's belt buckle replaced by the "Tesla" name. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] In July 2020, Tesla selected Austin as the site for the factory. [ 24 ] Austin [ edit ] In 2014, Tesla evaluated a 1,500-acre (600 ha; 2 sq mi; 6 km 2 ) manufacturing site on U.S. Route 79 at Frame Switch ( 30°32′N 97°30′W ﻿ / ﻿ 30.54°N 97.5°W ﻿ / 30.54; -97.5 ﻿ ( Hutto MegaSite, (Frame Switch, Texas) ) ), located between the towns of Hutto and Taylor , north-east of the Greater Austin center as its next factory. [ 25 ] [ 26 ] However, Tesla chose to build its first Gigafactory (now named Gigafactory Nevada ) near Sparks, Nevada which is by Reno in 2014. By June 2020, another location, one near the Del Valle area of Austin was being considered, a 2,100-acre (850 ha; 3.3 sq mi; 8.5 km 2 ) site bordering Harold Green Road (later renamed Tesla Road) and Texas State Highway 130 . [ 27 ] On June 16, 2020, the Commissioners' court of Travis County discussed a possible incentives package for Tesla. [ 28 ] [ 29 ] In July 2020, the Del Valle Independent School District approved a tax incentives package worth $68 million, should the Tesla Gigafactory be built. [ 27 ] On July 22, 2020, during Tesla's second quarter 2020 earnings call, the company announced that location had been selected for its fifth Gigafactory. [ 3 ] By the end of July 2020, construction had begun. [ 2 ] The Tesla Gigafactory received state tax incentives worth about $50 million through the Texas Tax Code Chapter 313 program. [ 30 ] Tesla announced a manufacturing training program in cooperation with Austin Community College District on June 15, 2021. [ 31 ] [ 32 ] [ 33 ] The program was expected to start in August 2021 and the course was to last 14 weeks. [ 34 ] The first fully completed Tesla Model Y rolled off the line at Giga Texas in the last week of August 2021 under trial production. [ 35 ] In December 2021, Elon Musk estimated that Giga Texas will require a total investment of at least $10B and may employ as many as 20,000 employees within the company. [ 36 ] In early 2022 Tesla battery suppliers CATL and Panasonic were reportedly scouting sites for battery factories in North America, including Kansas, Oklahoma, Mexico and Canada. [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Panasonic announced in July 2022 that the company selected De Soto, Kansas (at the former Sunflower Army Ammunition Plant ) to build a battery factory. Large subsidies and abatements were granted to Panasonic, organized by Governor Laura Kelly . Equipment [ edit ] Die casting [ edit ] Construction workers preparing three Giga Press foundations at the Gigafactory Texas site in January 2021 During the night of January 18/19, 2021, concrete foundations for three Giga Press high-press die-casting machines were poured at the north-east corner Giga Texas factory location. [ 39 ] [ 40 ] On January 21, 2021, the first Giga Press components started to arrive on site in crates and shipping containers . [ 41 ] [ 42 ] On January 22, 2021, the base frame of the first Giga Press was unboxed and craned into position. [ 43 ] Ramp-up [ edit ] Some time in late June 2022, Gigafactory Texas reached a run rate of 1,000 units a week. [ 44 ] On December 15, 2022, Gigafactory Texas reached a run rate of 3,000 units a week.
