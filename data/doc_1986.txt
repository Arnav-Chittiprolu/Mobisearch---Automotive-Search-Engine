[ 14 ] It was unveiled on 21 September 2017 as the smallest SUV model from Volvo, below the XC60 . Orders started in September 2017, and manufacturing began in November 2017. Along with conventional petrol and diesel engines, a plug-in hybrid model was introduced in 2019, and a fully electric model was released in 2020. Both the plug-in hybrid and the electric versions were marketed as the XC40 Recharge . In 2024, Volvo renamed the battery electric XC40 to the Volvo EX40 , aligning it with newer battery electric models such as the EX30 and the EX90 . [ 15 ] A coupe version of the battery electric model with a sloping rear roof was released in 2021 as the C40 Recharge . It was renamed to the Volvo EC40 since 2024. The XC40 received the European Car of the Year Award at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show . [ 16 ] and the car was named Car of the Year Japan for 2018/2019. [ 17 ] Overview The design of the XC40 was previewed by concept car called the Concept 40.1 , which was designed by Thomas Ingenlath, and unveiled in May 2016. [1] The XC40 is the first Volvo to be based on the CMA platform , to be shared by other compact Volvos, Geely , and Lynk & Co model. The platform was designed to maximise interior space. [ 18 ] The XC40 comes in front-wheel drive , rear-wheel drive (electric, from 2023) and all-wheel drive , and is powered by Volvo's 1.5-litre three cylinder and existing 2.0-litre four-cylinder engines, in both diesel and petrol variants. From 2019, a FWD plug-in hybrid named "T5 Twin Engine" is available, combining a 180 PS (178 hp; 132 kW) petrol version of the 1.5-litre engine with an 74 PS (73 hp; 54 kW) electric motor. In 2022, a mild hybrid version was introduced. [ 19 ] In the United States, engine choices are limited to the 2.0-litre four-cylinder petrol powered T4 and T5 models. [ 20 ] In 2023, Volvo removed conventional engines as an option, meaning mild hybrids are the base engine option in the US. [ 21 ] The version tested by Euro NCAP in 2018 had a kerb weight of 1,680 kilograms (3,700 lb). [ 22 ] Volvo Intellisafe is installed as standard. This technology is designed with the intention of preventing runoff road accidents. By using the car's advanced sensory system, the technology can detect potentially fatal scenarios such as run off-road protection. Safety belts are also capable of being automatically adjusted throughout these moments of impact while energy absorbing seat frames and seats are in place to prevent spine injuries. This technology was created based on real life data, and various crash test track methods such as: ditch, airborne and rough terrains. [ 23 ] The XC40 was given the European Car of the Year Award at the 2018 Geneva Motor Show . [ 24 ] and the car was named Car of the Year Japan for 2018/2019. The XC40 was awarded Car of the Year by the magazine What Car? in January 2018, also Carsales Car of the Year in 2018, [ 25 ] and Irish Car of the Year in 2019. [ 26 ] The company increased their production across 2018 to 2019 to meet global demand. [ 27 ] Rear view Interior XC40 Recharge Pure Electric / EX40 The XC40 Recharge Pure Electric is Volvo's first battery electric model, which was revealed on 16 October 2019. It is powered by a 78 kWh battery pack. It went on sale in late 2020, with limited quantities available in select markets . [ 28 ] Volvo announced that after the XC40 Recharge, it plans to "launch one new electric vehicle every year, and pledges to make half its lineup fully electric by 2025." [ 28 ] In 2023, the single motor version was revised by adopting the rear-wheel drive layout instead of front-wheel drive. It is the first rear-wheel-drive variant of a Volvo vehicle in 25 years. The revised version received a new motor, resulting in improved range and efficiency. [ 8 ] In 2024, the XC40 Recharge Pure Electric was renamed to the EX40. [ 29 ] XC40 Recharge Pure Electric (pre-facelift) EX40 Rear view C40 Recharge / EC40 The C40 Recharge is a derivative of the XC40 Recharge, which was released on 2 March 2021. [ 30 ] [ 31 ] It officially commenced production in September 2021. It is also the first Volvo nameplate that is only available as a battery electric vehicle. [ 32 ] It was renamed to the EC40 in 2024. The model shared the front end, front doors and interior design as the conventional XC40. [ 33 ] The main difference between the XC40 and the C40 is the roofline, with the C40 having a coupe -style sloping roofline. The C40's electric drivetrain is nearly identical to the battery electric XC40 Recharge. [ 32 ] It uses a 78 kWh lithium-ion battery pack (75 kWh usable) to power its dual motors and has an EPA -estimated range of 226 miles (364 km), three miles (4.8 km) more than the XC40 Recharge. [ 34 ] The version tested by Euro NCAP in 2022 had a kerb weight of 2,149 kilograms (4,738 lb). [ 35 ] Similar to the XC40 Recharge Pure Electric, the C40 received a revised version with rear-wheel drive instead of front-wheel drive for the single motor version. The update improved range amongst other things. [ 8 ] C40 Recharge Rear view EC40 Rear view Facelift The XC40 had received a facelift for the 2023 model year. In late 2021, photos had been leaked exposing pictures of the new XC40. In 2022, the facelift was quietly unveiled on Volvo configurator. [ 36 ] The XC40 received aesthetic changes that bring it more into line with the C40 Recharge (headlights, bumpers, Android Automotive for the mild hybrid models, new ADAS sensor platform, etc.). [ 37 ] Furthermore, Volvo dropped diesel powered models from the lineup.
