It is an electrification -focused vehicle, offering three versions: hybrid , plug-in hybrid and battery electric variants.

Based on the same platform as the Hyundai Ioniq , Kia opted to use dual-clutch transmission instead of the more traditional continuously variable transmission found in most other hybrids to offer a more engaging driving experience. The size is between the Stonic and Sportage , and very close to the XCeed . In Europe, the Niro was launched in a choice of seven colours and either 16- or 18-inch wheels. It was the first Kia model to feature Android Auto, available from its launch, while Apple CarPlay was made available towards the end of 2016. Seven airbags were included as standard, along with other safety features including autonomous braking, smart cruise control, and lane departure warning. [ 8 ] Noise reduction was a key development focus, with Kia achieving a quieter cabin by use of increased front structure insulation and the use of acoustic windshield glass. [ 9 ] Full production started in May 2016 in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi , South Korea, with European sales from the third quarter of 2016. [ 8 ] A plug-in version was launched in the United Kingdom in the end of 2017, and in the United States in the beginning of 2018, [ 10 ] [ 11 ] with an electric version launched in 2018. [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Towards the end of 2018 and start of 2019, sales of the Niro PHEV ranked highly in Denmark and Sweden in a list of top plug-in car sales. The Niro received a facelift in 2019 which included changes to the front and rear bumpers, as well as new headlights and color choices. Unlike the prototypes, no production version was ever offered with four wheel drive. [ 14 ] Hybrid (HEV) [ edit ] The 2017 Kia Niro Hybrid was unveiled at the 2016 Chicago Auto Show . A subcompact hybrid utility vehicle, the model's exterior design is marketed as "un-hybrid", [ 15 ] saying it is more conventional than other hybrid cars. [ 16 ] The Niro uses a hybrid powertrain producing altogether 104 kW (139 hp), and returns a fuel economy of 5.5 to 4.7 L/100 km (43 to 50 mpg ‑US ) by also using lightweight materials, including high strength steel and aluminium. [ 17 ] [ 18 ] Its traction battery has a capacity of 1.56 kWh which weighs 33 kilograms (73 lb), with Kia claiming that this offers up to 50 per cent increased energy density and 13 per cent more energy efficiency than rivals. [ 19 ] From 2017 onwards, the hybrid does not feature a conventional lead-acid starter 12-volt battery; instead, a 12-volt lithium battery is housed adjacent to the traction battery. This innovation saves weight and maintenance. [ 20 ] In its first month on sale, the Niro hit an all time sales record in the green car market in South Korea, even beating the Hyundai Ioniq . [ 21 ] 2017 Niro Hybrid (pre-facelift) 2022 Niro Hybrid (facelift) Interior Plug-in hybrid (PHEV) [ edit ] A plug-in electric vehicle (PHEV) variant has been offered since September 2018, featuring an 8.9 kWh battery. [ 22 ] [ 23 ] The Kia Niro and Niro Plug in Hybrid form part of Kia hybrid range, that also includes the Optima Plug-in Hybrid and Optima Sportswagon Plug-in Hybrid. [ 24 ] The Kia Niro went on sale in South Korea on 31 March 2016. [ 25 ] The plug-in has the same dual-clutch transmission as the hybrid variant, an important differentiator from most other hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles which use a continuously variable transmission . The Niro PHEV was the best selling plug-in car in Denmark in December 2018, with 1,113 sales representing a 24% share, ahead of the Nissan Leaf which took a 14% share respectively. [ 26 ] In Sweden during February 2019, the Niro PHEV claimed 2nd position and share of 11%, behind the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV with a 17% share. [ 27 ] Although Kia claimed that the variant could obtain a fuel economy of 1.400 L/100 km; 168.0 mpg ‑US (201.8 mpg ‑imp ), real-world tests suggested 1.96 L/100 km; 120 mpg ‑US (144 mpg ‑imp ) in one test [ 28 ] and 4.9 L/100 km; 48 mpg ‑US (58 mpg ‑imp )  in another. [ 29 ] In 2019, Kia announced facelifted versions of its Niro hybrid variants, with new front and rear bumpers, lights and wheels among the changes to its line-up. LED headlights and fog lights became an optional extra, while two new colours red-orange and plum were added. [ 30 ] 2018 Niro PHEV (pre-facelift) 2018 Niro PHEV (pre-facelift) 2019 Niro PHEV (facelift) Gasoline engine [ edit ] Both the hybrid and the plug-in hybrid versions of the Niro feature a gasoline engine.

[ 31 ] It shares powertrain and battery configuration with the Hyundai Kona Electric . Niro EV is available in two battery versions: 39.2 kWh and 64 kWh. The batteries are liquid-cooled lithium ion polymer. Batteries are manufactured/supplied by SK Innovation, which is different from the Kona Electric, which uses batteries from LG Chem . [ 32 ] The 39.2 kWh version is propelled by a 100 kW (134 hp) permanent-magnet electric motor with 395 Nm (291 lb-ft) of torque and can travel up to 288 km (179 mi) on one charge, according to WLTP , while the 64 kWh version offers 455 km (283 mi) of WLTP range and has a more powerful 150 kW (201 hp) motor producing the same amount of torque. [ 33 ] Both cars are front-wheel drive . In the US, the Niro EV has an official EPA range of 239 mi (385 km) on a full charge. Both versions have a CCS charge port which enables DC rapid charging at up to 77 kW. The onboard charger power is 7.2 kW or optionally 11 kW. [ 34 ] On 3 May 2022, pre-orders of the Niro EV began in South Korea. [ 35 ] The Niro EV is equipped with a 64.8 kWh high-voltage battery, smart regenerative braking system 2.0, a heat pump , and a battery heating system. And it can run 463 km (WLTP combined) on a single charge. Also, the battery conditioning function is applied to automatically adjust the battery temperature according to the external environment. 2019 e-Niro 2018 e-Niro 2021 e-Niro 2021 e-Niro Niro Plus [ edit ] Kia introduced the Kia Niro Plus in 3 May 2022. Released in South Korea from the second half of 2022, the Niro Plus is a new variant of the Niro that maximises the onboard space by increasing the height of the vehicle by 80 mm, and by using thinner seats. The total length also increases by 10 mm. The second-row legroom was expanded by 28 mm by adjusting the position of the second-row seat. In addition, the taxi model was applied by additionally applying the power seat and reclining function of the driver seat and lowering the height of the driver seat headrest by 43 mm. An integrated All-in-One Display for taxi model includes navigation, app taximeter, digital tachograph and voice recognition. [ 36 ] [ 37 ] All-in-one display is applied with AI assistant technology associated with navigation system, informing remaining battery amount at destination or suggesting route via charging station when remaining battery amount is insufficient. Unlike the second-generation Niro, the Niro Plus is assembled by Donghee in Seosan , South Chungcheong Province which also makes the Morning , Ray and the Stonic . [ 38 ] Two variants are offered: the Niro Plus Taxi (specifically intended for cab drivers and only available in BEV) and Kia Niro Plus (offered to all types of customers and available in HEV, PHEV and BEV), while The latter will be exported overseas.
