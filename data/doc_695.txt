According to the 2024 census, it has a population of 430,920 people. [ 5 ] It is the second largest local government unit in Laguna after Calamba . [ 6 ] Located 40 kilometers (25 mi) south of Manila , it was rapidly developed into an urban area as a result of the growing congestion and conurbation of the Manila Metropolitan area . It is also the richest city in Luzon outside of Metro Manila in terms of annual income, which was recorded to be ₱ 4.99 billion as of 2022. [ 7 ] Santa Rosa is derived from Spanish for Saint Rose of Lima , its patron saint to whom it is consecrated to. [ 8 ] The town was initially known for the Coca-Cola , RC Cola, and Toyota manufacturing plants in its industrial estates . It later became popular as the site of the Enchanted Kingdom theme park and several housing and commercial developments. History [ edit ] 2017 stamp of the Philippines dedicated to the 225th anniversary of Santa Rosa In 1571, Spanish conquistador Juan de Salcedo , the grandson of Miguel López de Legazpi , founded the town of Biñan which was annexed as a barrio to Tabuco (now Cabuyao ) while exploring the region of Laguna de Bay . In 1688, Biñan, together with Barrio Bukol, separated from Cabuyao. After a series of renaming and separating barrios to become independent towns, Barrio Bukol was politically emancipated as the municipality of Santa Rosa, founded on January 18, 1792. During the revolutionary period in 1898, the town was instrumental in the proclamation of Philippine independence from Spain when the country signed the Act of Independence on June 12, 1898. Later on, the town's local revolutionaries fought alongside the forces of Pío del Pilar during the Philippine–American War . The present-day Gusaling Museo served as the municipal hall of Santa Rosa from 1828 to 1954. On February 5, 1945, the town was abandoned by Japanese soldiers when the local guerrilla resistance movement, with support from the American and Filipino military contingent, entered the town. During the postwar era up until the 1970s, the townspeople primarily depended on basic agriculture and family-owned enterprises for their livelihood. The influence of industrialization grew in the 1980s with the entry of local and foreign investors who were responsible for the fast-paced economic and social transformation of the town and the province. Cityhood [ edit ] Main article: Cities of the Philippines On July 10, 2004, Santa Rosa was converted into a city by Republic Act No. 9264, [ 9 ] which was approved by voters in the plebiscite. Leon Arcillas, who began his third and final term ten days before, became its first city mayor. Contemporary [ edit ] Arcillas was assassinated at the old city hall by three assailants. [ 10 ] They were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in 2013. [ 11 ] Jose Catindig Jr. , who served as vice mayor, became mayor to serve out the remainder of his term. On May 14, 2007, Catindig, who ran for his full term as mayor, was defeated by Arcillas' daughter Arlene . On August 28, 2019, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11395, [ 12 ] which separated the city from the province's first district to be granted its own congressional district to elect a representative in 2022 . In 2024, the city gained its own representation in the Laguna Provincial Board to separately elect two members starting in 2025 .
