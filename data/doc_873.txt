Tesla, Inc. has several factory buildings in the industrial zone of Vossenberg, Tilburg , in the Netherlands . In December 2012, a European Distribution Centre in Tilburg was announced, acting as the European parts and services headquarters. [ 1 ] The Tesla Tilburg assembly plant handled final assembly of Tesla Model S/X electric vehicles for delivery within Europe. [ 2 ] Buildings [ edit ] As of late 2018 [update] , Tesla has three factory buildings in the Vossenberg industrial area of Tilburg, 15 kilometres (10 mi) north of the Belgium–Netherlands border with a total floor area of 160,000 m 2 (1,700,000 ft 2 ). [ 3 ] The factory buildings are close to the Wilhelmina Canal , allowing for water-based delivery of intermodal containers arriving via the Port of Rotterdam . European distribution centre [ edit ] The first 18,900-square-metre (200,000 sq ft) Tesla facility started final assembly of Tesla Model S cars on 22 August 2013. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] It was Tesla's first factory outside California. [ 6 ] Final assembly plant [ edit ] By late 2015, the assembly plant was in the process of doubling capacity from 200 cars per week, to 450 cars per week. [ 6 ] The factory used for final assembly has a 3.4-megawatt rooftop photovoltaic power station . [ 2 ] Vehicles arrived from the Tesla Fremont Factory in California as " gliders " with the interior fully fitted out. The battery pack and electric drivetrain components were shipped separately and installed into the unpowered vehicles in Tilburg. [ 6 ] The factory building contains a 750-metre-long (2,460 ft) indoor test track with the back straight allowing speeds of 110 kilometres per hour (70 mph). [ 6 ] As of the 2021 S/X refresh, Tesla is no longer using this facility for S/X assembly. [ 7 ] Parts Distribution Centre & Warehouse [ edit ] In mid-2018, Tesla took control of a third building with an area of 36,000 square metres (390,000 sq ft), approximately 1.2 kilometres (0.75 mi) east of the headquarters building. [ 8 ] Now called the Tesla Global Parts Distribution Centre & Warehouse, the building had been certified by BREEAM as having a "very good" sustainability rating. [ citation needed ] In October 2017, the original developers Ontwikkelingscombinatie Scheg had sold the nearly-completed building to Standard Life Aberdeen investment organisation.
