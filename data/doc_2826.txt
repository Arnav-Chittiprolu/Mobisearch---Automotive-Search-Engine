From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Group of chemical compounds: aryl amines There are three isomers of toluidine , which are organic compounds discovered and named by James Sheridan Muspratt and August Wilhelm von Hofmann in 1845. [ 1 ] These isomers are o -toluidine , m -toluidine , and p -toluidine , with the prefixed letter abbreviating, respectively, ortho ; meta ; and para . All three are aryl amines whose chemical structures are similar to aniline except that a methyl group is substituted onto the benzene ring. The difference between these three isomers is the position where the methyl group (–CH 3 ) is bonded to the ring relative to the amino functional group (–NH 2 ); see illustration of the chemical structures below.

Due to the amino group bonded to the aromatic ring, the toluidines are weakly basic . The toluidines are poorly soluble in pure water but dissolve well in acidic water due to formation of ammonium salts, as usual for organic amines. ortho - and meta -toluidines are viscous liquids , but para -toluidine is a flaky solid . This difference is related to the fact that the p -toluidine molecules are more symmetrical. p -Toluidine can be obtained from reduction of p -nitrotoluene . p -Toluidine reacts with formaldehyde to form Tröger's base . Uses and occurrence [ edit ] The ortho isomer is produced on the largest scale. Its primary application is as a precursor to the pesticides metolachlor and acetochlor . [ 2 ] The other toluidine isomers are used in the production of dyes such as Allura Red AC (Red 40, E129) and azorubine (carmoisine, E122). They are a component of accelerators for cyanoacrylate glues. In some patients o -toluidine is a metabolite of prilocaine , which may cause methemoglobinemia . This is then treated with methylene blue . References [ edit ] ^ Muspratt, James Sheridan; Hofmann, Augustus William (September 1845). "On toluidine, a new organic base" .
