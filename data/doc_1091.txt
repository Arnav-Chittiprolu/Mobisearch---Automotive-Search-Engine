The e-tron's battery management system keeps part of the battery capacity as a buffer, which is not part of the usable capacity; now the size of that buffer was decreased to unlock more usable capacity. This change was introduced in the e-tron SUV during the production run, while in the e-tron Sportback, which entered production later, it was available from the beginning.

In 2022, it was announced that the vehicle will be renamed. It is now known as the Audi ''Q8'' e-tron Sportback.
