From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Compact executive roadster Motor vehicle Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class Overview Manufacturer Daimler-Benz (1995–1998) DaimlerChrysler (1998–2007) Daimler AG (2007–2020) Production 1996–2020 Body and chassis Class Sports car ( S ) Grand tourer (AMG models) Body style 2-door roadster Layout Front-engine, rear-wheel-drive The Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class is a compact executive roadster , produced by Mercedes-Benz . It was released in 1996 and was manufactured at the Mercedes plant in Bremen , Germany, until 2020. The former name "SLK" was derived from sportlich (sporty), leicht (lightweight), and kurz (short). [ 1 ] With the release of the facelift R172 in 2016, the SLK-Class was renamed to SLC-Class in accordance with the revised nomenclature adopted by Mercedes. Under this scheme, roadsters use the base name "SL", followed by the model's placement in Mercedes-Benz hierarchy, the letter "C", being the roadster equivalent to the C-Class . [ 2 ] [ 3 ] First generation (R170; 1995–2004) [ edit ] Main article: Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class (R170) R170 SLK-Class The R170 Mercedes SLK was the first generation compact roadster manufactured and marketed by Mercedes, from 1995 to 2004. [ 4 ] [ 5 ] It was designed from late 1991 under Bruno Sacco , with a final design being completed in early 1993 and approved by the board, with a German design patent filed on September 30, 1993. [ 6 ] The production SLK-Class was introduced at the Turin Motor Show on 22 April 1996, appearing as a modern incarnation of the 1950s Mercedes-Benz 190SL , by returning to four cylinders and with an identical 94-inch (2,400 mm) wheelbase. [ 7 ] A facelift was introduced to all models in 2000, featuring an updated design and updated engines. [ 8 ] Second generation (R171; 2004–2010) [ edit ] Main article: Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class (R171) R171 SLK-Class The R171 SLK was unveiled at the 2004 Geneva Motor Show . It features increased use of high-strength steel, [ 9 ] and improvements to the car's torsional strength and aerodynamic efficiency. [ 9 ] Models feature a more compact, revised roof mechanism that is operated in 22 seconds (previously 25 seconds), resulting in an increase in boot capacity by 63 liters (2.2 cu ft). [ 9 ] The R171 also introduced the Airscarf system that integrates neck-level heating system into the headrests of the car. [ 9 ] The front-end design of the car was inspired by the noses found in Formula One cars. [ 9 ] It was facelifted in 2008 and featured new engines and minor exterior design changes. [ 10 ] Third generation (R172; 2011–2020) [ edit ] Main article: Mercedes-Benz SLK-Class (R172) R172 SLK-Class Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class Front (left) The R172 SLK was released in 2011. [ 11 ] It was available with a range of inline-four , V6 , and V8 , diesel and petrol engines, and introduced an electronically operated window tint shade for the sunroof, called Magic Sky Control. A facelift was released for vehicles produced from March 2016, to coincide with the 20th anniversary of the SLK-Class. [ 12 ] The model range was also renamed to SLC-Class to conform to the new Mercedes nomenclature, and introduced new engines and a revised design. In 2020, Mercedes-Benz released a Final Edition to commemorate the end of the car's production run.
