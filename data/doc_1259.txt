=== Design ===
The Air has been designed to compete in the luxury sports segment against the [[Tesla Model S]] as well as high-line models from German car manufacturers.<ref name="tc20170316">{{Cite web |title=How does the Lucid Air stack up against the competition? |url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/16/how-does-the-lucid-air-stack-up-against-the-competition/ |access-date=2019-05-06 |website=[[TechCrunch]] |date=March 16, 2017 |language=en-US}}</ref> Its goal is to match the ability of sport [[coupés|coupes]],<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |url= https://lucidmotors.com/|title=Lucid| website= Lucid Motors| language=en|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref> but has a greater interior space, with a smaller external length and width.<ref>{{Citation| publisher= Lucid Motors| title=Exploring Air: Space Reimagined| date=2017-04-14 |via= YouTube |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKWTjlBksqM|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref> The exterior design was led by Derek Jenkins.

On September 9, 2020, the Lucid Air was officially unveiled, and on November 24, 2020, Lucid Motors detailed the full range including the Lucid Air Pure, Touring, Grand Touring and Dream Edition.<ref name="to start" />

=== Range ===
The Dream Edition R's [[United States Department of Energy|EPA]] range is up to {{cvt|520|miles}},<ref name=EPA2022FEG /> making it the longest range of any [[electric vehicle|EV]] rated by the EPA.<ref name=Doll>{{cite news|url=https://electrek.co/2021/09/16/lucid-shares-epa-range-for-air-models-including-520-miles-on-the-dream-edition-range/|author=Scooter Doll|date=September 16, 2021|title=Lucid shares EPA range for Air models including 520 miles on the Dream Edition Range|work=Electrek}}</ref>

On November 24, 2020, the company-predicted range for all four models was announced: {{cvt|406|miles}} for the Lucid Air Pure and Lucid Air Touring, {{cvt|503|miles|abbr=on}} for the Lucid Air Dream Edition, and {{cvt|516|miles}} for the Lucid Air Grand Touring.<ref name=Doll /><ref>{{Cite web |title= Lucid Names Its Base Model Lucid Air Pure|url=https://insideevs.com/news/456415/lucid-air-pure-base-model/|access-date=2020-12-25 |website= InsideEVs|language=en}}</ref> A 2022 test drive revealed that the Grand Touring model only managed 410 miles; however, this was still the first EV tested by ''[[Car and Driver]]'' to top 400 miles.<ref name=Dorian>{{cite news|url=https://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/a40628362/2022-lucid-air-grand-touring-by-the-numbers/|author=Drew Dorian|date=July 18, 2022|title=Tested: 2022 Lucid Air Grand Touring Dazzles with Clever Design and Inspired Engineering|work=Car and Driver}}</ref> In 2024, Lucid Air broke the Guinness World Record for an EV driving through the most countries with a single charge – crossing 9 countries in {{convert|567|miles|km|0|abbr=out}}.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2024-06-24 |title=Lucid Drives 912 km Through 9 Countries on a Single Charge, Breaking Guinness Record - EV |url=https://eletric-vehicles.com/lucid/lucid-drives-912-km-through-9-countries-on-a-single-charge-breaking-guinness-record/ |access-date=2024-06-26 |website=eletric-vehicles.com |language=en-US}}</ref>

=== DreamDrive (ADAS) ===
On July 29, 2020, Lucid Motors announced DreamDrive, an [[Advanced driver-assistance systems|Advanced Driver-Assistance System]] (ADAS) which will debut in the Air. The DreamDrive sensor suite has 32 sensors in total, including "14 cameras: Three forward-facing, four side- and rear-facing, four surround-view, a rear-facing, a rear-facing fisheye, and lastly, a driving monitoring one. There are five radar units. One is a forward-facing long-range sensor, and the other four are short-range ones. Twelve short-range ultrasonic sensors handle near-field detection, and lastly, a high-resolution, long-range, 125-beam (equivalent), forward-facing Lidar maps the three-dimensional space ahead of the car."<ref name=motortrend20200729>{{Cite news|date=2020-07-29|title=2021 Lucid Air's DreamDrive Driver Assistance Package Will Include 32(!)

=== Aerodynamics ===
The preproduction Air has a {{Cd|0.21|long=yes|link=car}}.<ref name=gcr20200708 /> Later reporting from ''[[Motor Trend]]'' gives it as {{Cd|0.20}} for the production version.<ref name="MTCOY">{{cite news |date=15 November 2021 |title=The Lucid Air is the 2022 Car of the Year |url=https://www.motortrend.com/news/lucid-air-2022-car-of-the-year/ |access-date=25 Dec 2021 |website=Motor Trend}}</ref> Rawlinson claims the Air has less drag than the [[Mercedes-Benz EQS]] due to a smaller frontal area.<ref>{{cite web| url= https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001811210/000110465921093160/tm2122473d1_425.htm|title=Lucid Investor Call Transcript |date= July 16, 2021 |publisher=Securities and Exchange Commission|website= SEC.gov |access-date= September 16, 2021}}</ref>

=== Powertrain ===
[[File:Lucid Air Chassis - center and rear.jpg|thumb|Lucid Air chassis at Lucid Studio in New York City]]
In February 2020, Lucid Motors announced a partnership with [[LG Chem]] through which the latter company would provide battery cells for the Lucid Air sedan through 2023.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://marketrealist.com/p/who-makes-lucid-motors-battery|title=The Lucid Air Sedan's Battery Might Have Tesla Worried|first=Dan|last=Clarendon|date=February 24, 2021|website=Market Realist}}</ref>

In December 13, 2022 – [[Panasonic]] Energy Co., Ltd., and Lucid Group, Inc. announced they had entered into multi-year agreements to supply batteries for Lucid’s award-winning luxury electric vehicle.<ref name="AA"/><ref name="PE" />

The entry level Air Pure will be equipped with a 88-kWh battery with rear wheel drive, capable of producing {{cvt|430|hp|0}},<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lucidmotors.com/air/specs|title = Lucid Air &#124; Specs |website=Lucid Motors |date= | access-date= }}</ref> {{cvt|600|Nm|0}} of torque and {{cvt|406|miles|0}} of range.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Lucid Air: 235mph EV to be launched at New York motor show|url=https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/motor-shows-new-york-motor-show/lucid-air-235mph-ev-be-launched-new-york-motor-show|access-date=2020-08-19|website=Autocar|language=en}}</ref> The Air Dream Edition Range will had a 112&nbsp;kWh battery pack which will provide an estimated {{cvt|520|miles}} of EPA range. The Air Dream Edition Performance will had a combined output of {{Convert|1,111|hp|0|abbr=on}} and will be able to accelerate from {{cvt|0|–|60|mph}} in 2.5 seconds.<ref name=":1" /> In their most recent performance test, it achieved a top speed of {{cvt|235|mph}}.<ref>{{Cite news| url= https://electrek.co/2017/07/10/lucid-motors-all-electric-sedan-top-speed/|title=Lucid Motors hits 235 mph (378&nbsp;km/h) top speed with its all-electric sedan| last= Lambert |first= Fred |date= 2017-07-10|website=Electrek|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref>

{{as of|2021}}, the most efficient version on sale in the US, the Air Grand Touring with 19-in wheels, has an EPA rated energy efficiency of {{cvt|26|kWh/100mi|mpge}}.<ref name=EPA2022FEG />

Later independent reporting on real-world testing (drag strip performance times) showed the {{cvt|1,111|hp|kW|0}} Air Dream variant achieving a {{convert|1/4|mile|m|0|abbr=out}} time of 10 seconds flat. The test providers noted that conditions on that particular day were suboptimal (colder than ideal temperature for example), leading them to speculate that {{frac|1|4}} mile times closer to 9.8 seconds could be achieved under friendlier conditions.{{Citation needed |date= March 2022}}

=== Battery and charging ===
[[File:Lucid Air Electric Drive Unit and Battery.jpg|thumb|Lucid Air Electric Drive Unit and Battery]]
Lucid Motors plans to offer a nationwide charging plan to customers in the US through its joint agreement with [[Electrify America]].<ref name=thedrive20190510>{{Cite web |url=https://www.thedrive.com/tech/23813/lucid-motors-to-use-electrify-america-charging-network-for-its-air-electric-car |title=Lucid Motors to Use Electrify America Charging Network |last=Edelstein|first=Stephen |website=The Drive |date=September 25, 2018 |access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref> The 800-volt DC charging system, first used by the [[Porsche Taycan]], allows variable voltages up to 1000 volts, and thus is fully compatible with Lucid's 924-volt electrical architecture.<ref name=electrek20200205>{{cite news |last1=Lambert |first1= Fred |title=Lucid: Tesla hasn't cracked it, we can take it to whole new level of range and efficiency |url= https://ww.electrek.co/2020/02/05/lucid-air-tesla-range-efficiency/ |website=[[Electrek]] |date=5 February 2020}}</ref>

When used with a 300&nbsp;kW or higher [[charging station]], the vehicle can gain 300 miles of range in 20 minutes.<ref>{{Cite web |last= Brady |first= Duncan |date= 2021-08-25|title=2022 Lucid Air|url=https://www.motortrend.com/cars/lucid/air/2022/|access-date=2021-09-13| website= Motor Trend| language=en-US}}</ref>  The vehicle features a bidirectional rectifier capable of supplying up to 19.2&nbsp;kW (240V ~ 80A) of AC power that could power a home or other load.<ref name="lucid20200911" />

It upconverts 400-volt or lower power coming from a charger to its operating voltage. It downconverts the battery pack's 900 volts to 400 volts to power other loads in the vehicle or to charge another vehicle.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Markus |first=Frank |date=2021-11-15 |title=The 2022 Lucid Air's Stunning EV Powertrain Tech Is Why It's So Far Beyond the Competition |url=https://www.motortrend.com/features/2022-lucid-air-powertrain-tech-deep-dive/ |access-date=2023-01-07 |website=MotorTrend |language=en}}</ref>

The company claims that its 2170 cells differ significantly from normal lithium ion cells due to their tolerance of repeated cyclic fast charging and non-use for a prolonged period of time while maintaining capacity.<ref name="chargedev20190519" />

The Lucid Air is also capable of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) charging, but only when using the optional RangeXchange<ref>{{Cite web |date=November 9, 2023 |title=Introducing RangeXchange, an Innovative New Feature Enabling the Lucid Air to Directly Charge Other Electric Vehicles |url=https://ir.lucidmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/introducing-rangexchange-innovative-new-feature-enabling-lucid}}</ref> cable in conjunction with the second generation 40A Mobile Charging Cable.<ref>{{Cite web |title=40A Mobile Charging Cable Kit |url=https://store.lucidmotors.com/40a-mobile-charging-cable-kit/ |access-date=2024-08-17 |website=store.lucidmotors.com |language=en}}</ref> Edit summary (Briefly describe your changes) By publishing changes, you agree to the Terms of Use , and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and the GFDL .
