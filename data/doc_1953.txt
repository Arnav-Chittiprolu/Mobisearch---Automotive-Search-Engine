The model was launched for the European market in September 1996 and marked Audi's return to small cars after 19 years, following the demise of the Audi 50 in 1978. The A3 was the first Volkswagen Group model to use the PQ34 (or "A4") platform , bearing close resemblance to the Volkswagen Golf Mk4 , which arrived a year later. Within three years of the A3's launch, the PQ34 platform was utilised by seven different vehicles. Initially, the A3 was only available as a three-door hatchback; this was done to give the model a sportier image and differentiate it from the Golf. Offered with transversely mounted inline four-cylinder engines in both front and quattro four-wheel drive , the A3 was Audi's eighth model to have five valves per cylinder. The dashboard was also used by the first generation SEAT León and second generation SEAT Toledo . The United Kingdom received the Audi A3 in November 1996. In 1999, Audi expanded the A3 range with the introduction of a five-door hatch and two new engine options; a 1.8 L turbocharged inline four-cylinder rated at 180 PS (132 kW; 178 hp), and a 1.9 L TDI diesel with unit injector "Pumpe Düse" (PD) technology and a variable geometry turbocharger . The four-wheel drive A3 1.8T Quattro used either the 150 PS (110 kW; 148 hp) or 180 PS (132 kW; 178 hp) engine, and the same Haldex Traction -based quattro system as the Audi S3 and Audi TT . In late 2000, the A3 range was updated with new headlights and taillights, an improved interior, and other minor cosmetic changes alongside the introduction of a six-speed manual gearbox on the 180 PS (132 kW; 178 hp) 1.8T and new 130 PS (96 kW; 128 hp) 1.9 TDI. With this update, Audi's electronic stability control , traction-control, and brake force distribution systems became standard in some countries. Although the first generation Audi A3 was replaced in Europe in 2003, it continued to be sold in select markets; Brazilian production of Typ 8L A3 continued until 2006.

[ 7 ] Their evaluation concluded "the column lock, adjuster lever and bracket presented hazards in the knee impact area for the driver. These could cause high loads on his upper legs and damage to his knees." The A3 also provided minimal protection for pedestrians, and received two stars out of a possible four. [ 7 ] S3 (1999–2003) [ edit ] Audi released the A3-derived S3 in 1999. Only available as a three-door hatchback, the S3 was powered by a turbocharged 1.8 L 20v inline four-cylinder. Early models (1999–2001) produced 210 PS (154 kW; 207 hp), with later models (2001–2003) receiving variable valve timing which increased output to 225 PS (165 kW; 222 hp). The engine had a maximum torque output of 280 N⋅m (210 ft⋅lbf). The S3 was the first Audi S-series car to utilise a smaller four-cylinder engine. The S3's quattro system utilises a Haldex Traction coupling to adjust the bias of torque distribution from the front to rear axle as grip requirements change. [ 8 ] Due to this, the S3 typically operates in front-wheel-drive in most conditions. The S3 was sold in Europe, Japan, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2002, the S3 received a facelift, receiving revised front wings, rear lights clusters, single-piece headlight and indicator units, and minor interior trim updates. Standard features include xenon HID headlamps with high pressure washers and auto levelers, front fog lamps, 17-inch "Avus" alloy wheels with 225/45R17 tyres, [ 9 ] electrically adjustable Recaro leather seats, climate control, an alarm and electronic stability control with traction control . Options include a Bose sound system, boot/trunk or in-dash mounted 6-disc CD changer, metallic paint, 18-inch 9-spoke RSTT wheels, glass sunroof, centre arm rest, privacy glass (B-pillar backwards), auto-dimming rear-view mirror, parking assist, luggage net, heated front seats, cruise control, aluminium door mirror casings and part leather/Alcantara (blue/silver/yellow) combination seat coverings. Some of these items are standard in certain export markets.

Originally launched only as a three-door hatchback with four-cylinder engines, it featured a new automobile platform (the PQ35 platform), a redesigned and more spacious interior, new petrol engines with Fuel Stratified Injection (FSI), and standard six-speed manual gearboxes (except on the base 1.6 petrol and 1.9 diesel). In mid-2003 the line was updated with two sports-oriented models, a 2.0 Turbo-FSI version rated 200 PS (147 kW; 197 hp), and a 3.2 L VR6 engine (for the first time) with 250 PS (184 kW; 247 hp). Haldex Traction-based quattro on-demand four-wheel drive, and the S-Tronic semi-auto gearbox were introduced as options (quattro is standard on the VR6) on models with engines over 140 PS (103 kW; 138 hp). In 2005 the "S line" trim level, offering new decorative elements, became available and the three-door A3 received the same front-end styling features as the Sportback model. For the first time, the A3 became available in the North American market, exclusively with the Sportback body, with the base 2.0 inline-four FSI introduced in 2005 as a 2006 model, and the 3.2 VR6 Quattro following.

The A3 Sportback is 80 mm (3.1 in) longer than the base three-door body, and includes improved rear cabin space and a larger luggage compartment (370 litres). It also received the new "single frame" front grille originally introduced in the A8 W12 , which was later adopted across the whole A3 range. S3 (2006–2013) [ edit ] In August 2006, Audi introduced the second generation S3. Offered in three- and five-door body styles, the second generation— Typ 8P—S3 is powered by a modified and uprated Volkswagen Group-sourced 2.0-litre turbocharged FSI petrol engine, with a maximum output of 195 kW (265 PS; 261 bhp). As with all Audi S models, the design was done in-house by quattro GmbH . The engine features uprated high-performance pistons, revised boost/fuel mapping, increased turbocharger size ( KKK K04) and larger intercooler . The most powerful form of this engine, and quattro four-wheel drive, makes for a 0–100 km/h (0–62 mph) time of 5.7 seconds, and an electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph). Audi offers both six-speed manual and six-speed S-Tronic automatic transmissions with the S3. The spring ratings and dampers were revised, along with the body kit. Like its predecessor, although badged a "Quattro" model, the S3 does not employ a Torsen centre differential (as in other common Quattro models), but instead uses the Swedish Haldex Traction system in its on-demand four-wheel drive transmission, due to the transverse engine layout.

Despite Audi increasing the protection inside the car for the driver and passengers, pedestrian safety actually got 33% worse compared to the first generation and Euro NCAP gave criticism for the car offering virtually no protection at all on the front end and scoring just one star from a possible four. "A poor result for a new car" was the verdict given for pedestrian safety after the test. 2003–2005 Audi A3 3-door 2005–2008 Audi A3 3-door 2005–2008 Audi A3 3-door 2005–2008 Audi A3 Sportback Interior (Sportback) 2008 facelift [ edit ] Audi introduced a number of changes to the A3 and S3 in 2008. These include revised nose and tail styling, with a modified grille and daytime running lights, common rail 2.0 TDI engines, seven-speed S tronic dual clutch transmission availability for the smaller non-U.S. engines, and optional "magnetic ride" adaptive shock absorbers. In addition, the range includes an S3 Sportback model. [ 16 ] Also, a cabriolet version was introduced. It was similar in dimensions to the 3-door version, with a two-box design. 2008–2010 Audi A3 Sportback 2008–2010 Audi A3 Sportback 2008–2010 Audi A3 3-door 2008–2010 Audi A3 cabriolet 2010–2013 Audi A3 Sportback 2010–2013 Audi A3 Sportback 2010-2012 Audi A3 cabriolet 2010 Audi S3 Sportback 2010 Audi S3 Sportback Interior Audi A3 TDI Clubsport quattro (2008) [ edit ] Audi A3 TDI Clubsport quattro is a concept car unveiled in 2008. Based on the Audi A3 three-door, it is an approach by Audi to address both performance and the environment. The engine in the concept car is a turbocharged 2.0-litre diesel producing 224 hp (167 kW) and 332 lb⋅ft (450 N⋅m) of torque. It produces 113.8 horsepower (84.9 kW) per litre while meeting Euro 5 Diesel emission standards. It uses the quattro drive system with a six-speed manual transmission. The chassis has Audi's Magnetic Ride Suspension system, lowering the vehicle 1.4 inches (36 mm) from the base model. It also has ceramic front brakes, a four-link rear suspension and electro-mechanical servo assist for the rack and pinion steering. [ 17 ] Exterior modifications include the widening of the three-door's grill, modifying the odd, and enlarging air intakes. Bolt-on fender flares and a large rear spoiler have been added. The interior changes include sport seats and a flat-bottomed steering wheel. [ 17 ] Audi claims performance of 0 to 62 mph (0 to 100 km/h) in 6.6 seconds with a top speed of 240 km/h (149 mph). [ 18 ] It is expected to get approximately 40 miles per US gallon (5.9 L/100 km; 48 mpg ‑imp ). [ 19 ] RS 3 Sportback (2011–2012) [ edit ] The Audi RS 3 is derivative of the A3 Sportback with a 5-cylinder , 2,480 cc (151 cu in) turbocharged engine rated at 340 PS (250 kW; 335 hp) and 450 N⋅m (332 lb⋅ft), vermicular-graphite cast iron crankcase, seven-speed S tronic transmission with two automatic modes and one manual mode, Quattro on-demand four-wheel drive system, widened track to 1,564 mm (61.57 in), MacPherson strut in aluminium, lowered body by 25 mm (0.98 in), 19-inch cast aluminium wheels in machine-polished titanium styling (optional black with a red rim flange) with 235/35 front and 225/35 rear tires, 370 mm (14.57 in) front and 310 mm (12.20 in) ventilated brake discs, aluminium brake disk covers, four-piston fixed calipers in high-gloss black with RS logos, electronic stabilization program with Sport mode, flared front fenders made of carbon-fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP), prominent sill panels and exterior-mirror casings in matte aluminium, roof spoiler, high-gloss black diffuser insert, two elliptical exhaust tailpipes on the left, black interior, sports seats upholstered in Nappa leather with silver contrasting stitching, inlays in Piano black finish or Aluminum Race colour, flat-bottomed leather multifunction sports steering wheel, choice of five body colours are available with an unlimited selection of custom paint finishes. Its acceleration is quoted as 0 to 100 km/h (0 to 62 mph) in 4.6 seconds, with an electronically limited top speed of 250 km/h (155 mph). Optional features included front bucket seats, roof rails in matte aluminium look, styling packages in black or matte aluminium. [ 20 ] First deliveries started in early 2011. [ 21 ] Audi RS3 Sportback front view (8P) Audi RS3 Sportback rear view (8P) A3 Cabriolet Sport and S line Final Edition (2013) [ edit ] The A3 Cabriolet Sport Final Edition is a version of the A3 Cabriolet Sport model for the UK market, commemorating the end of the A3 Cabriolet's production run. It included Vienna leather upholstery, front seat heating, rear parking sensors, automatic headlight and wiper activation, cruise control, a Bluetooth mobile phone interface.

[ 22 ] Engines [ edit ] In January 2007, the naturally-aspirated 2.0 FSI was replaced by a new turbocharged 1.8 TFSI engine rated 160 PS (118 kW; 158 hp). It is available in front-wheel drive only. In late 2007, Audi introduced a new 125 PS (92 kW; 123 hp) 1.4 L TFSI engine for the A3, replacing the 1.6 L FSI engine, and a new diesel "e"-model. The "e"-model, Audi's equivalent of Volkswagen's BlueMotion , is available with the 1.9 L TDI engine, and offers a more ecological car, with a CO 2 emission below 120 g/km. Audi released two models of the A3 1.6 TDI for the European market. The first uses Audi's start/stop and energy recovery system, and produces 105 PS (77 kW; 104 hp). This engine achieves approximately 4.1 L/100 km (69 mpg ‑imp ; 57 mpg ‑US ). [ clarification needed ] The second engine does not use the same efficiency systems and will produce 90 PS (66 kW; 89 hp) will get 4.5 L/100 km (63 mpg ‑imp ; 52 mpg ‑US ). They went on sale in June 2009. [ 23 ] In 2009, the 1.6 L eight-valve petrol engine was replaced by a turbocharged 1.2 TFSI engine already found in VW's Polo and Golf models. This engine is rated at 105 PS (77 kW; 104 hp) and 175 N⋅m (129 lb⋅ft), emitting 127 g/km of CO 2 . [ 24 ] The A3 2.0 TDI clean diesel is a version of Audi's A3 2.0 TDI for the North American market, making it the second Audi TDI vehicle sold in North America, following the Audi Q7 TDI in 2008. It is a FWD vehicle with S-Tronic transmission with Hill-hold assist, Sirius satellite radio, Leather seats and steering wheel, Auxiliary audio input, Dual-zone climate control, 17-inch (430 mm) alloy wheels. The vehicle was unveiled at the 2009 North American International Auto Show . This US model would begin sale in the first quarter of 2010 as a 2010 model year vehicle. [ 25 ] In March 2011, the line-up was expanded with the introduction of a more powerful 2.0 TDI with 170 PS (125 kW; 168 hp).

[ 75 ] The new exterior and interior styling is heavily inspired by Lamborghini , LED headlights and taillights, with the option of Matrix LED headlights. [ citation needed ] It shares the MQB evo platform with other Audi models, and with the Volkswagen Golf Mk8 , SEAT Leon Mk4 , and Škoda Octavia Mk4 . It is 3 centimetres longer and wider when compared to the outgoing model while keeping the wheelbase length the same, trunk cargo space is 380 litres with the seats up, and 1200 litres with the seats folded down. It has a drag coefficient of 0.28, and is powered by 1.0-litre 3-cylinder petrol turbocharged engine with 110 hp, 1.5-litre  with 150 hp, 2.0-litre TDI with 116 hp or 150 hp. There is also a new 2.0-litre Quattro version in both petrol and diesel variants. It produces 190 hp (142 kW) and 320 N⋅m (236 lbf⋅ft) of torque (400 Nm for the diesel variant). It also has reduced cargo space (320 litres instead of the 380 litres in the other A3 variants) due to the Quattro four-wheel-drive system. The S3 model has the same 2.0L petrol engine from the previous generation, producing 310 hp (231 kW) and 400 N⋅m (295 lbf⋅ft) of torque, but this time is only available with an automatic gearbox. Similarly it has reduced cargo space due to the Quattro four-wheel-drive system. In the United States, the S3 is equipped with the newer EA888.4 2.0L engine shared with the Mk8 Golf R, rated at 306 hp (228 kW) and 400 N⋅m (295 lbf⋅ft). Like the previous generation, the new S3 also comes as a saloon/sedan. This generation of the A3 Sedan is not expected to arrive in North America until late 2021, as a 2022 model. [ 76 ] The A3 Sportback e-tron, or any other variant of the A3 Sportback, will not be sold anymore in North America. In countries where the PHEV variant of the A3 Sportback will be sold, it will no longer be called the e-tron because this name is reserved for electric Audi cars. Instead, it is called TFSIe . There are two versions, the "40 TFSIe" and the "45 TSFIe". The former has a 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) time of 7.4 sec, while the latter is based on the Golf GTE and has a 0–62 mph (0–100 km/h) time of 6.3 s. Rear view Interior Audi A3 Saloon front view Audi A3 Saloon rear view Audi S3 Sportback Audi S3 Saloon Audi A3L front view (China) Audi A3L rear view (China) Audi RS 3 [ edit ] The highest specification RS 3 model is fitted with a 2.5-litre 5-cylinder producing 400 PS (294 kW; 395 hp) and 500 N⋅m (369 lb⋅ft), and has a 0-60 mph (97 km/h) acceleration time of 3.8 seconds. It gets a seven-speed dual-clutch automatic S-Tronic gearbox. It also gets the new MMI infotainment system, with a 10.25 or 12.3-inch digital instrument cluster, and a secondary screen of 10.1-inches. With the RS Dynamic package the speed limiter is removed, allowing the RS3 to reach a top speed of 290 km/h (180 mph). [ 77 ] The US-market RS3 produces marginally more power than the European RS3, at a claimed 401 hp (299 kW; 407 PS). [ 78 ] This is partially due to the lack of a petrol particulate filter for US model cars, as it is not required to meet emissions standards. The US-market RS3 instead receives a secondary catalytic converter. In October 2022, the RS3 Performance Edition was introduced for European buyers. The boost was increased from 1.5 to 1.6 bar (21.8 to 23.2 psi), bringing power up to 407 PS (299 kW; 401 hp) and thus matching the peak power of the federalized version. Torque remained as before but across a slightly wider range. [ 77 ] The (unlimited) top speed reaches 300 km/h (186 mph), a first for an A3 based model. Production is limited to 300 units. [ 77 ] Audi RS3 Sportback Audi RS3 Saloon 2024 refresh [ edit ] Audi presented a revised version of the A3 and S3 on 12 March 2024, announcing the RS3 after. The mid-cycle refresh saw the introduction of the allstreet variant, featuring a raised body and off-road trim. [ 79 ] [ 80 ] It featured updated exterior styling elements including revised headlights, a redesigned front grille, modified bumpers, new wheel designs, and an updated rear diffuser [ 81 ] [ 82 ] . Interior updates include silver trim around the air vents, enhanced ambient lighting, and decorative fabric trim accents throughout the cabin [ 83 ] . A significant mechanical change for 2025 is the standardization of Audi's quattro all-wheel drive system across all A3 variants in North America, eliminating the previously available front-wheel drive configuration [ 84 ] . The base model RS 3 maintains the same 2.5-liter turbocharged inline-five, with the North American sedan version updated to produce 401 hp compared to the previous 396 hp. It remains paired with an updated version of the Quattro S seven-speed dual-clutch automatic. The 0–60 mph time for the facelifted model improves from 3.8 to 3.6 seconds, with a factory-limited top speed of 155 mph. [ 85 ] Fuel efficiency is slightly better, with the RS3 Sedan rated at 9.1 L/100 km 25.8 mpg US and 207 g/km of CO₂ emissions. [ 86 ] The European RS 3 Sportback shows slightly more fuel consumption and emissons compared to the sedan, with a rating of 9.3 L/100 km 25.3 mpg US and its CO₂ emissions of 217 g/km, retaining its G-class efficiency classification. [ 86 ] The updated RS3 benefits from a revised chassis aimed at improving handling with updates to the torque splitter, adaptive dampers, and wheel-selective torque control. This allows the car to turn more sharply and reduce understeer. These improvements contributed to the development driver, Frank Stippler, setting a 7:33.123 lap time on the Nürburgring track, beating the previous compact-class record by more than five seconds. [ 87 ] The A3 powertrain consists of a 2.0-liter turbocharged inline-four engine producing 201 horsepower, paired with a 48-volt mild hybrid system. For the 2025 model year, torque output increased to 236 lb-ft from the previous 221 lb-ft [ 88 ] . Power is delivered through a seven-speed S tronic dual-clutch automatic transmission. The mild hybrid system enables improved fuel efficiency through extended stop-start functionality and regenerative capabilities [ 89 ] . The A3 features a 10.3-inch digital instrument cluster as standard, with an optional upgrade to a 12.3-inch display through the Technology package. A 10.1-inch touchscreen infotainment system comes standard with wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto integration [ 90 ] . Two trim levels are offered in the United States: the Premium starting at $38,200 and the Premium Plus at $40,800. The A3 earned a spot on Car and Driver's Editors' Choice list for 2025 [ 91 ] .
