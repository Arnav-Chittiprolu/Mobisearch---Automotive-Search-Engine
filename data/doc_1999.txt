[ 5 ] Based on the CX-30 , it was unveiled at the 2019 Tokyo Motor Show . [ 6 ] Production of the vehicle, which is Mazda's first mass-produced electric car , began at their Ujina factory on 19 May 2020. [ 7 ] The plug-in hybrid variant uses a drivetrain operating in series , with a rotary engine acting as a range extender to the batteries.  As one of the first automakers to successfully manufacture and market a Wankel rotary engine , Mazda built the engines longer than anyone else, with their last example installed in the Mazda RX-8 . [ 8 ] It's also Mazda's first rotary-engined front-wheel-drive car since the Luce R130 . Overview [ edit ] Rear view The MX-30's freestyle doors Interior The MX-30 features clamshell doors , marketed as freestyle doors by Mazda and previously used on the rotary-engined RX-8 sports car. [ 9 ] [ 10 ] It uses MacPherson strut front suspension and torsion beam rear suspension. [ 11 ] The MX-30 is powered by an electric motor supported by a 35.5 kWh battery with a power output of 105 kW (141 hp; 143 PS) and 264 N⋅m (195 lbf⋅ft) torque, offering a range of 209 km (130 mi). [ 12 ] Up to 80% charge can be achieved within 30 to 40 minutes via 40 kW DC charging. With a 6.6 kW AC (1 phase, 230V, 29A) charging unit, the MX-30 is claimed to get fully recharged within 4.5 hours. [ 13 ] The plug-in hybrid variant was presented on 14 January 2023. [ 4 ] Its drivetrain operates in series , featuring a rotary engine that acts as a range extender to recharge the batteries, but not to power the vehicle's wheels directly. [ 14 ] The Wankel engine is a naturally aspirated single-rotor unit with a chamber volume of 830 cc, petrol direct injection, exhaust gas recirculation, a three-way catalyst and a particulate filter. Its rated power output is 55 kW (75 PS; 74 hp). [ 4 ] In Japan, Australia and New Zealand, a gasoline-powered all-wheel-drive mild hybrid version is also available. This version is powered by Mazda's 2.0 L e-Skyactiv-G four-cylinder engine.

[ 43 ] [ 44 ] Nonprofit consumer organisation Consumer Reports stated, "With such a small battery, the EPA-estimated range is a scant 100 miles. That would have been competitive a decade ago, but it's not in today's EV market." CR called it a "strange little car" and found the vehicle noisy but applauded fit and finish and said it was "a fun little handler."
