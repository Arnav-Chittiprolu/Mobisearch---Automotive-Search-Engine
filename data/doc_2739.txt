Tire hazards may occur from failure of the tire, itself, or from loss of traction on the surface over which it is rolling. Structural failures of a tire can result in [[flat tire]]s or more dangerous [[Blowout (tire)|blowouts.]] Some of these failures can be caused by manufacture error and may lead to recalls, such as the widespread Firestone tire failures on Ford vehicles that lead to the [[Firestone and Ford tire controversy]] in the 1990s.

=== Tire failure ===
Tires may fail for any of a variety of reasons, including:<ref>{{cite book|title=Tire forensic investigation : analyzing tire failure |last=Giapponi |first=Thomas R. |date=2008 |publisher=SAE International |isbn=9780768019551 |location=Warrendale, Pa. |oclc=213080702}}</ref>

{{Anchor|Belt separation}}
* ''Belt separation'' which may be belt-to-belt, tread and belt, or separation of the edge of the belt. Belt-to-belt separation may occur having the tire deflect too much, from high pavement temperatures, road hazard impacts, or other causes that have to do with maintenance and storage.
{{Anchor|Non-belt separation|Non-belt separations}}
* ''Non-belt separations'' include those at the tire tread, in the bead area, in the lower sidewall, between reinforcing plies, and of the reinforcing steel or fabric materials.
* Other types of failure include run-flat damage, chemical degradation, cracking, indentations and bulges.

===Vehicle operation failures===

* ''Melting rubber'': As tire rubber compounds heat, owing to the friction of stopping, cornering, or accelerating, they may begin to melt, lubricate the tire-road contact area, and become deposited on the pavement. This effect is stronger with increased ambient temperature.<ref name=":0A" />
* ''Hydroplaning'': Motor vehicles or aircraft tires passing over a wet pavement may lose contact with sufficient speed or water depth for a given tread design. In this case, the tire contact area is riding on a film of water and loses the friction needed for braking or cornering and begins to ''[[Aquaplaning|hydroplane]]'' (or ''aquaplane''). Hydroplaning may occur as ''dynamic hydroplaning'' where standing water is present with a depth of at least {{Convert|3|mm|in}} above the texture of the pavement and speed is sustained above a threshold level. It may also occur as ''viscous hydroplaning'' whereby tire rubber melts for a brief interval and causes slippage. This may leave deposits of rubber on a [[runway]] as airplanes land.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lrRCWz3f_78C&q=aquaplaning+vs+hydroplaning&pg=PA89|title=Aircraft Performance Theory for Pilots |last=Swatton |first=Peter J. |date=2008-04-30 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9780470693056 |location=New York |pages=89–91}}</ref> Dynamic hydroplaning causes decreased friction and contact with increased tire speed.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=aLgNET9YkS0C&q=aquaplaning+vs+hydroplaning&pg=PA287 |title=Advanced Vehicle Technology |last=Heisler |first=Heinz |date=2002-07-17 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9780080493442}}</ref>
* ''Snow'': The degree to which a tire can maintain traction in snow depends on its ability to compact snow, which material then develops strength against slippage along a shear plane parallel to the contact area of the tire on the ground.<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=U_Y5AQAAMAAJ&q=traction+in+mud|title=Driving Traction on Ice with All-season and Mud-and-snow Radial Tires |last=Blaisdell|first=George L.|date=1983|publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers, Cold Regions Research & Engineering Laboratory|language=en}}</ref> At the same time, the bottom of the tire treads compress the snow on which they are bearing, also creating friction. The process of compacting snow within the treads requires it to be expelled in time for the tread to compact snow anew on the next rotation. The compaction/contact process works both in the direction of travel for propulsion and braking, but also laterally for cornering.<ref name="Hays2"/>
* ''Ice'': Ice is typically close to its melting point when a tire travels over it. This, combined with a smooth texture, promotes a low coefficient of friction and reduced traction during braking, cornering or acceleration.<ref name=":0A" />
* ''Soft ground'': Soil can become lubricated with water, which reduces its ability to maintain shear strength when a tire tries to apply force in acceleration, braking, or cornering. Dry sand also has low shear strength, owing to poor cohesiveness among sand particles.<ref>{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tyje5iXkGmUC&q=traction+in+mud&pg=PA74 |title=Four-Wheeler's Bible |last=Allen |first=Jim |date=2009 |publisher=MotorBooks International |isbn=9781616730888}}</ref> Edit summary (Briefly describe your changes) By publishing changes, you agree to the Terms of Use , and you irrevocably agree to release your contribution under the CC BY-SA 4.0 License and the GFDL .
