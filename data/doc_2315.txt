Appalachian Highlands – lying on the eastern side of the United States, it includes the Appalachian Mountains , Adirondacks and New England province. Interior Plains – part of the interior contiguous United States, it includes much of what is called the Great Plains . Interior Highlands – also part of the interior contiguous United States, this division includes the Ozark Plateau. Rocky Mountain System – one branch of the Cordilleran system lying far inland in the western states. Intermontane Plateaus – also divided into the Columbia Plateau , the Colorado Plateau and the Basin and Range Province , it is a system of plateaus, basins, ranges and gorges between the Rocky and Pacific Mountain Systems. It is the setting for the Grand Canyon , the Great Basin and Death Valley . Pacific Mountain System – the coastal mountain ranges and features in the west coast of the United States . Administrative divisions of the United States [ edit ] States of the United States [ edit ] Main articles: U.S. state and Administrative division At the Declaration of Independence , the United States consisted of 13 states , former colonies of the United Kingdom. In the following years, the number of states has grown steadily due to expansion to the west, conquest and purchase of lands by the American government, and division of existing states to the current number of 50 United States : [ 3 ] Map of the United States with state border lines.
