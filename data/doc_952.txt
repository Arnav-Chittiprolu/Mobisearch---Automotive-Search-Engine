https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:All_disambiguation_pages

Help From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia For convenience, all disambiguation pages should be included in this category. This includes all pages that can also be found in the subcategories. This category includes 5.29% of all Wikipedia articles. This is a maintenance category , used for maintenance of the Wikipedia project . It is not part of the encyclopedia and contains non-article pages , or groups articles by status rather than subject. Do not include this category in content categories (except for eponymous maintenance categories). This is a tracking category . It builds and maintains a list of pages primarily for the sake of the list itself. They are not part of the encyclopedia's categorization scheme . The pages in this category are disambiguation pages. It enables us to use {{PAGESINCATEGORY:All disambiguation pages}} to get the exact number of disambiguation pages in Wikipedia. To add a page to this category, tag it with a disambiguation template (templates built with the {{ dmbox }} meta-template, which does the actual categorising). This category is hidden on its member pages —unless the corresponding user preference (Appearance → Show hidden categories) is set. These categories can be used to track, build and organize lists of pages needing "attention en masse " (for example, pages using deprecated syntax), or that may need to be edited at someone's earliest convenience. These categories also serve to aggregate members of several lists or sub-categories into a larger, more efficient list ( discriminated by classifications ). Description : This category lists disambiguation pages in all namespaces. (For technical reasons it does not list pages in the template namespace, these are instead found in Category:Template disambiguation pages .)
