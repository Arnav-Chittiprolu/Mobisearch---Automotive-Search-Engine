From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Electric car racing season ‹ The template Motorsport season is being considered for merging . › 2025 Extreme E Championship Previous 2024 Next none Catie Munnings (left) and Andreas Bakkerud (right) won the last ever Extreme E race for Team Hansen . The 2025 Extreme E Championship , [ 1 ] promoted as The Final Lap , [ 2 ] was the fifth and final season of the Extreme E electric off-road racing series. [ 3 ] [ 4 ] Planned in the aftermath of the failed 2024 season, it consisted of a one-off farewell event held at Qiddiya City , Saudi Arabia against the backdrop of the Tuwaiq mountains. [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The double-header took place on 4–5 October 2025, days before the inaugural edition of the hydrogen -based, FIA -backed Extreme H World Cup. [ 7 ] Johan Kristoffersson and Mikaela Åhlin-Kottulinsky won round one for Kristoffersson's KMS outfit, [ 8 ] while Catie Munnings and Andreas Bakkerud won the last ever Extreme E race for Team Hansen . [ 9 ] Calendar [ edit ] On 6 September 2024, with only 4 of 10 races in its 2024 campaign completed, Extreme E announced the cancellation of its planned remaining rounds. [ 10 ] With the season on hold, founder and CEO Alejandro Agag stated the series was "reviewing alternative solutions" to fulfil its calendar. [ 11 ] The attempts did not come to fruition and instead, on 4 September 2025, nearly a full year later, a one-off return was announced. [ 12 ] Scheduled for early October at an undisclosed location in Saudi Arabia, later confirmed to be Qiddiya City , [ 13 ] it served as a final send-off for Extreme E before it formally passed the baton to Extreme H . [ 14 ] Round Event Location Dates 1 Desert X-Prix Qiddiya City , Saudi Arabia 4 October 2025 2 5 October 2025 Teams and drivers [ edit ] The year-long hiatus and imminent hydrogen switch resulted in a significant shakeup, with five of the eight teams being new. [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Acciona | Sainz and JBX remained from the 2024 grid, the former with an unchanged lineup, while Carl Cox Motorsport returned. [ 17 ] All teams used one of the identical Odyssey 21 electric SUVs manufactured by Spark Racing Technology and consisted of a male and a female driver, who shared a car and had equal driving duties. [ 18 ] The event saw Yokohama replace Continental as tyre supplier.

[ 20 ] English DJ Carl Cox revived his team after a year's absence, and linked up 2023 driver Timo Scheider with Klara Andersson . Scheider also doubled up as team principal, a role he had previously held at SUN Minimeal. [ 22 ] After Rosberg X Racing disbanded at the end of 2024, [ 30 ] two-time champion Johan Kristoffersson set up his own XE and XH squad for himself and teammate Mikaela Åhlin-Kottulinsky . [ 23 ] Kristoffersson Motorsport (KMS) also entered a second car in collaboration with talent agency EVEN Management, fielding the Norwegian duo of returnee Hedda Hosås and rookie Ole Christian Veiby . [ 28 ] Jenson Button rebranded his JBXE team to JBX and joined forces with Team Monaco, a project set up by kite surfer Maxime Nocher and investor Chris Taylor. [ 24 ] They ran an all-new lineup of Christine GZ and Tommi Hallman, who made his championship debut after serving as reserve driver in 2023 and 2024. [ 31 ] Despite being the first team to commit to Extreme H in February 2025, Veloce Racing did not appear on the final grid of either event. [ 32 ] Saudi firm Jameel Motorsport then launched a team and signed former Veloce pair Kevin Hansen and Molly Taylor . [ 25 ] As Andretti Global ended its Extreme E involvement, Timmy Hansen stepped up and brought his father's FIA World Rallycross Championship team Hansen Motorsport to the grid. He secured the services of long-term teammate Catie Munnings and former JBXE driver Andreas Bakkerud . [ 27 ] Legacy Motor Club and McLaren did not return to Extreme E, with the latter also pulling out of Formula E . [ 33 ] Mid-season changes After an accident in the first qualifying heat of round one, Molly Taylor was transferred to a local hospital for checks. She was replaced by reserve driver Claire Schönborn for the rest of the day and returned for round two.
