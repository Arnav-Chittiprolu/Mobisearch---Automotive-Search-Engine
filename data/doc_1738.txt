[ 9 ] Brand Weltmeister [ edit ] Official premiere of the first car, along with the announcement of the "Weltmeister" brand, under which WM Motor products will be offered, took place in May 2018. The EX5 model took the form of an SUV with an electric drive, [ 10 ] going into production and sale on the internal Chinese market at the end of 2018.

[ 17 ] Bankruptcy [ edit ] In the second half of 2022, WM Motors found itself in a bad financial situation, which was caused by growing debt and losses recorded despite attempts to increase sales and product portfolio. As a result, the company was unable to put the flagship M7 model on sale, and moreover - it ended the production of all its existing models at the end of 2022, laid off staff and closed most sales points. [ 18 ] The following year, the president of WM Motor started looking for new sources of financing and implemented a savings plan. [ 19 ] These actions were unsuccessful, and as a result, in mid-October 2023, WM Motor announced bankruptcy. [ 20 ] Freeman Shen indicated that the factors preventing the company from remaining on the market were the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, stagnation of the capital market and the increase in raw material prices.

A day after the bankruptcy application was accepted by the Shanghai court, drivers lost access to the WM Motor mobile application, the website stopped working and contact with the support center disappeared, leaving after-sales and service support in question.
