The population was 52,736 at the 2020 census . Normal is the smaller of two principal cities of the Bloomington–Normal metropolitan area, and is Illinois' seventh most populous community outside the Chicago metropolitan area . It is home to Illinois State University and Heartland Community College . Founded in 1865, it was renamed Normal in 1867, because the university when it began was focused on educating teachers (a normal institute ), Illinois State Normal University . Chris Koos has been the mayor of Normal since 2003. [ 4 ] History [ edit ] The town was laid out with the name North Bloomington on June 7, 1854, by Joseph Parkinson. [ 5 ] From its founding, it was generally recognized that Jesse W. Fell was the force behind the creation of the town. He had arranged for the new railroad, which would soon become the Chicago and Alton Railroad , to pass west of Bloomington and then curve to cross the Illinois Central Railroad at a point where he owned or controlled land. Most of the original town lies south of these tracks, with Beaufort Street as its northern limit, and some blocks west of the Illinois Central and north of the tracks. [ 6 ] Fell, his brothers, and associates quickly laid out many additions to the original town. The town was renamed Normal in February 1865 and officially incorporated on February 25, 1867. [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The name was taken from Illinois State Normal University, a normal school (teacher-training institution) located there. The school has since been renamed Illinois State University after becoming a general four-year university. Normal is adjacent to Bloomington, Illinois , and when mentioned together they are known as the "Twin Cities", " Bloomington–Normal ", "BN", or "BloNo". In 2007, the town council voted to name the downtown area "Uptown Normal", [ 9 ] and, as of 2011, Uptown Normal is home to the Children's Discovery Museum, Marriott Hotel and Conference Center, Hyatt Place Hotel, Uptown Station and Town Hall, Brewe-Ha's Bar and Grill, and a variety of local shops and restaurants all centered around a roundabout. [ 10 ] The district is also home to the historic non-profit Normal Theater , a restored Art Deco theater owned by the Town of Normal that shows classic and independent films. On August 31, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a mobile home park in Normal that left three people dead and three more injured. The deceased were two women and a man, the latter being the gunman. The shooter was shot and killed by responding police officers. [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Geography [ edit ] According to the 2010 census, Normal has a total area of 18.412 square miles (47.69 km 2 ), of which 18.35 square miles (47.53 km 2 ), or 99.66%, is land and 0.062 square miles (0.16 km 2 ), or 0.34%, is water.
