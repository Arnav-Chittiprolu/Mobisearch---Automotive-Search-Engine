It is the first generation model of the BMW X1 range, and was replaced by the F48 BMW X1 in mid-2015. When launched, it was the smallest SUV in the BMW lineup. [ 7 ] Development and launch [ edit ] 2010–2011 BMW X1 sDrive20d (Australia; pre-facelift) 2011 BMW X1 xDrive20d M Sport (UK; pre-facelift) Development of the vehicle started in 2006 as petrol prices were going up, BMW identified the need for a smaller and more efficient model in its SUV line-up. As the result, it was reported that BMW has shortened the development and pre-production time by 40 percent compared to previous X Series models. [ 8 ] The project director of the X1, Peter Kist commented that "never before has BMW produced a model that is meant for such a wide customer range." He pointed out it is suitable for young people and older people, and as X1 is the first BMW X Series to be available in the sDrive trim (two-wheel drive), it is suitable for customers who do not need off-road capability. [ 8 ] The E84 X1 was revealed in a near-production prototype called the Concept X1 that was revealed at the Paris Motor Show in October 2008. [ 9 ] The final production version of the X1 is based on the same platform used in the E90 3 Series , and both have the same 2,760 mm (108.7 in) wheelbase. [ 10 ] The platform is also used in the Zinoro 1E , which is an all-electric crossover based on the X1, with a rear-mounted 125 kW (168 hp) electric motor that produces 250 N⋅m (184 lb⋅ft) of torque. [ 11 ] The X1 is available in rear-wheel drive (marketed as sDrive), and all-wheel drive (xDrive) variants with a 40/60 rear-bias. [ 12 ] Equipment [ edit ] The X1 offers 420 L (14.8 cu ft) of cargo volume. [ 13 ] The rear seats can be folded in a 40:20:40 split and increases the storage space to 1,350 L (47.7 cu ft). [ 14 ] Standard equipment includes dual-zone climate control , parking sensors, 17-inch alloy wheels, and regenerative braking . [ 15 ] From 2012, the X1 is also offered in xLine, Sport, and M Sport trims. [ 16 ] xDrive25i and 35i models are only available with a 6-speed automatic transmission . [ 17 ] The rest of the model range receives a 6-speed manual transmission and all models (except the sDrive20d EfficientDynamics) are optionally available with an automatic transmission. [ 18 ] 18i and 23d models receive a 6-speed automatic, while 20i, 16d, and 25d models are available with an 8-speed automatic. [ 19 ] 28i, 18d, and 20d models featured a 6-speed automatic until 2011, before being replaced by an 8-speed transmission.
