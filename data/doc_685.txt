Career [ edit ] Professional skateboarding [ edit ] Born in Baltimore, Maryland , Lasek started skateboarding at the age of 12, shortly after his bike was stolen. [ 1 ] After entering amateur contests, he was quickly noticed by Powell Peralta talent scouts in 1987.  Powell Peralta promptly sponsored Lasek and introduced him in a 1987 publication as a 14 year old newly-sponsored amateur who "rides a mini-Caballero with X-Bones." [ 3 ] Lasek made his video debut in the fourth Bones Brigade video, Public Domain (1988). [ 4 ] As of May 2009, Lasek owns a backyard concrete skateboarding bowl named "Lasekland".

Lasek continued with the team earning several second and third place finishes through his career with Subaru. He left the team after the 2016 season. [ 6 ] Video game appearances [ edit ] Lasek is a playable character in the first five games in the Tony Hawk's series : Tony Hawk's Pro Skater through Tony Hawk's Underground . He later reprised his role in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2 , a remake of the first two games in the series, and in the sequel Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 . Film and television [ edit ] Lasek made a cameo appearance in the low-budget 2003 movie Haggard , in which he hands a skateboard to Bam Margera while he runs from the villain Hellboy. He appeared in MTV's reality television series Viva La Bam and in the music video for Pink 's single " Raise Your Glass ". He served as a stunt double in the 2003 movie Grind . [ 7 ] He also made an appearance as himself in an episode of The Jersey called "What's Gotten Into Elliott Rifkin?", and also attended the sixth dinner service of Hell's Kitchen ' s 21st season . Personal life [ edit ] As of June 2015, Lasek resides in Encinitas, California with his wife Jennifer (m. September 1996) and their three daughters. [ 8 ] Contest results [ edit ] As of 2016, Lasek has won 13 medals at the X Games , including ten gold medals, and is one of only two vert skateboarders to have won three X Games gold medals consecutively—the other is Pierre-Luc Gagnon . [ 9 ] Lasek is also one of only three athletes to compete at every X Games since the series' inception in 1995.
