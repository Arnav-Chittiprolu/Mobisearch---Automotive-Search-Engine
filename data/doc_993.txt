Outside of Japan, the line is known as the Isuzu C/E series and Isuzu S&E series [ 2 ] and was formerly known as the Isuzu Heavy-Duty Truck' . [ 3 ] Between 1994 and 2016, it was also sold in South America (under the Chevrolet brand as Chevrolet C/E series ). First generation (1994) [ edit ] Motor vehicle Isuzu Giga First Generation Overview Manufacturer Isuzu Motors Ltd. Also called C/E series (Intl. exports) Chevrolet C / E series (Latin America) Production 1994–2015 (Japanese market), Until 2022 (Export market) Body and chassis Body style Truck (standard cab (Worldwide), crew cab (Australia only)) Powertrain Engine 6NX1 & 6HK1 (Indonesian market only based on Isuzu F-series), 6SD1, 6WA1, 6WF1, 6WG1, 6UZ1, 8PE1, 8TD1, 10PE1, 10TD1, 12PE1 Transmission 7-speed manual 12-speed Smoother-G AMT 16-speed manual 16-speed Smoother-G The first generation was introduced in November 1994 as the successor to the Isuzu 810 . The box truck version is the KC-C series, and the tractor trailer version that was released in 1995 is the KC-EX series, and there is a 1 placed at the end of the model number (Example: KC-CXZ81K1), indicating it is model 1. Depending on the customizations, a letter may be placed after that, such as D for dump trucks (Example: KC-CXZ81K1D). These were Isuzu's first models with a GVW of 22t and 25t. There are two types of cabs, a highway cab for cargo and an off-road cab for dump trucks. The headlights of the highway cab were set into the front bumper. At the time, the majority of truck headlights were set into the cab itself, while setting them into the bumper became common practice later. As such, it can be said that the Giga was a forerunner in terms of this design. The cab design, doors and lights are the same as the fourth-generation Isuzu Forward released earlier that year in February 1994, and the rear door of the double cab is the same as the Isuzu 810. The low-floor 4-axle GVW 25t vehicle was the first Japanese-made large goods vehicle to use the same type of wheels throughout (originally ultra-low profile 265/60 with a 22.5-inch rim changed to a 19.5-inch rim). The GVW 22t and 20t vehicles where the same as previous models. There were five trims available: Space Cruiser (called King Dump for dump trucks), high custom, custom, standard, and limited. The highest-grade trim, the Space Cruiser, had an electric curtain, wood grain paneling and synthetic leather-wrapped steering wheel and gear shift, while the lowest-grade trim, the limited, was fitted with only one seat. In 1995, the tractor trailer and all-wheel drive versions were added. The tractor trailer model was fitted with a special gunmetal-gray chrome molding in the front panel. The second version was released in 1997 after a minor design change. A 2 was placed at the end of the model number (Example: KC-EXR82D2) to denote this. The grill of the front panel of the tractor trailer and GigaMAX dump truck was divided into eight. The driver's seat of all vehicles in this line were equipped with SRS airbags, making it the first large goods vehicle line to do so, and the vehicles were equipped with HID headlights. The 6x4 semi-tractor is equipped with the domestic highest 600PS V-type 10-cylinder naturally aspirated engine 10TD1 . The front grille of the off-road cab semi-tractor has been changed from three slits to six holes. Released Gigamax with 4-bag air suspension . The straight-six engine car has a high cab, and the fender rubber has a thick shape. The straight-six cars have a higher cab, a dedicated bumper, headlights at a higher position than usual, and a license plate at a lower position than usual. On this model, the tires of 4-axle low-floor vehicles have a smaller total wheel diameter. 2000: Minor change to medium-term model. Conforms to 1999 emission regulations (KL-). It becomes type 3 (example: KL-EXR52D3). The grille on the front panel of the highway cab has an inverted trapezoidal design, and the engine has been changed from 12PE1 to 8TD1 for the V type and from 6WA1 to 6WF1 and 6WG1 for the straight-six engine. Since most of the models have moved to straight-six engines, the high cab style has been standardized according to the type 2 straight-six engine (there are also low cab specifications for specially equipped vehicles such as tank trucks). In addition, since the off-road cab car with a straight-six engine is a high cab, the front bumper is now diverting the specification without air dam for the highway cab (the headlight part is closed). The snorkel of a straight-six engine car has been changed from an elongated shape to a flat shape. June 2003: There is no change in the design, but it becomes a 4 type with a minor change (example: KL-CYL23T4). Conforms to 2001 noise regulations. In addition to the semi-tractor, the full air brake was standardized and the naturally aspirated V-type engine was removed from the lineup and quickly unified into the intercooler turbo engine. Smoother G setting. Although the speed indicator was abolished, the lens shape of the speed indicator still remains on the high roof car, and it is painted in body color. November 2003: Vehicles equipped with a 6WF1 engine are additionally set to comply with the 2004 emission regulations (new short-term emission regulations). The model is type 5 (example: PJ-CYL51V5Z). KL-No difference in appearance from the car. 2004: Setting of the completed car "G Cargo". August 2005: Minor change to type 6 (example: PJ-CYJ51W6). The front bumper has been changed in appearance. The front bumper for low cab cars of type 1 and 2 is reused, and a spacer of a new part is attached to the top. Conforms to safety standards for lighting equipment (off-road cab is abolished). Bumpers with license plates below the headlights have disappeared. The position of the front license plate of all cars was unified to the same height as the headlights. The lens of the front turn signal was divided into two, the outside was the turn signal, and the back was the fog lamp. Strictly speaking, this combination lamp itself is a diversion of the 2000 MC model Super Dolphin Profia and Space Ranger. It was a change). Previously, the side turn signal installed in the blister fender of the cab had a built-in side reflector, but since the change was made to move only this reflector to the bumper corner, the reflector space of the side turn signal is a dummy. Fully comply with the 2004 emission regulations (new short-term emission regulations, PJ-). Replaced 6SD1 type engine with 6UZ1 type engine. As with Hino Motors ' Profia, which has a partnership with all-wheel drive vehicles to reduce costs, production has been discontinued. As with Profia, UD Trucks (formerly Nissan Diesel Industry) is an OEM of Quon 's all-wheel drive vehicles to meet the demand for snow removal vehicles and agricultural and livestock vehicles that require all-wheel drive vehicles. 1 April 2006: Added 2005 emission regulation compliant vehicles to vehicles equipped with 6UZ1 engine . Expansion of equipment for the completed "G Cargo" and additional settings for the "Super G Cargo" with a short cab and roof bed. March 2007: A minor change was made in advance of a car equipped with a 6UZ1 engine. It is practically 7 type, but for some reason the model is 8 type by skipping 7 (example: PDG-CYL77V8). The grill design of the front lid has been changed to what is called a "6 cube". At the same time, it is also a big feature that the black belt that existed directly under the front window has disappeared. The "GIGA" logo has also been redesigned, and the front logo has been moved from the left side to the right side to share the image with the elf and forward. Low cab specifications are abolished. All vehicle types comply with the new long-term emission regulations, and vehicles that meet the 2015 fuel efficiency standards will be set as the main vehicle types. Newly developed millimeter-wave radar inter-vehicle distance warning device and cruise control as " VAT ". The garnish on the top of the bumper has been changed from black to gull gray. Isuzu Giga facelift (Phase II) June 2007: A minor change was delayed for vehicles equipped with the 6WG1 engine. An electronic vehicle attitude control system (IESC) is newly adopted for the tractor. 6WF1 type engine is abolished. October 2007: Developed a collision damage mitigation brake that automatically decelerates during dangerous driving to reduce collision damage. Expand IESC to motorcycles. February 2009: Mirrors for cargo vehicles have become aerodynamic, and door turn signals have been downsized and made into clear lenses to comply with the regulations (ECE / R48). In addition, a side monitoring monitor has been added to "VAT". 17 May 2010: Big minor change. It is practically type 8, but the number at the end of the model disappears (example: LKG-CYL77A). The A at the end means that it is the first Giga, and on models other than the long chassis, the alphabet indicating the length of the chassis is attached behind the A. The urea SCR system jointly developed with Hino is combined with DPD to comply with the 2009 emission regulations. As a general rule, powertrains are unified with 6UZ1 type engine. A 16-speed MT with an auxiliary transmission is newly set for the dump truck (CXZ / CYZ). The cab has expanded the front grille area to improve engine cooling performance, and the headlights have been changed to the same ones as the forward increased ton specification car . Also, the 22.5 inch wheels have been changed from JIS standard 8 studs to ISO standard 10 studs. Giga 2010 model (final facelift of the first generation) 28 October 2014: Partially improved. VAT / IESC (Electronic Vehicle Attitude Control System) is standard equipment. A short cab is set for the 3-axle vehicle. Defects and recalls [ edit ] In 2008, 2,225 Japanese Giga models from the 2007 model year were recalled after it was discovered they had faulty fuel tank caps which could cause fuel inside the tank to leak. [ 4 ] In 2009, 5,475 Japanese Giga Turbo models from the 1999-2005 model years were recalled after it was discovered they had faulty turbos which could result in turbine blade damage and output may be insufficient, resulting in inability to operate. [ 5 ] In 2019, 1,205 Australian CX and EX models from the 2010 and 2019 model years were recalled after it was discovered they had faulty front under-run protection device (FUPD) reinforcement brackets which could cause the FUPD to fail if involved in a front-end collision.

This is the first Isuzu heavy-duty truck to continue to undergo a full model change with the same car name (until now, the car name has changed from New Power to 810 to Giga for each FMC). The slogan is "Let's run, together." Most of the cab skeleton and components have been shared with forwards and elves (the new Giga's cab monocoque itself is the same as the forward wide cab), and the radiator opening has been expanded to improve cooling, aerodynamics and economic performance. .. In addition, parts such as headlights and mirrors continue to use the same parts as the original Giga after the 2010s, and interior lights etc. are diverted from Profia . In the interior of the cab, the instrument panel is made into a semi-round instrument panel to improve the holdability and breathability of the seat. In addition, a steering switch and a multi-information display with a 4-inch LCD monitor were adopted. There are four types of cabs: a full cab, a full cab high roof with a high ceiling, a bedless short cab, and a two-story short cab maxi roof with a bed above the cab. In addition, standard and custom grades are set. The engine continues to use the 6UZ1 with a displacement of 9.8L . However, improvements such as making the turbocharger continuously variable capacity have been made to improve low to medium speed torque. In addition, Ecostop is standard equipment on cargo and dump trucks to improve fuel efficiency as well as improve the engine body. The transmission uses Smoother-Gx. In addition, the braking ability of the auxiliary brake is improved by adopting the engine retarder as standard. In addition, the 6UZ1-TCS and 12-stage smoother Gx-equipped vehicles use the inertial driving function "Smart Glide" to improve fuel efficiency. The pre-crash brake system uses a double detection system that refers to the camera in addition to the millimeter-wave radar, which greatly improves the forward detection accuracy. In addition to the conventional collision damage mitigation braking function, a collision avoidance support function for moving obstacles has been added. In addition, when the camera recognizes the driving lane and the system determines that the vehicle deviates from the driving lane, a function is added to warn the driver by a lane departure warning by a warning sound and a display of a liquid crystal monitor in the meter. Mimamori, which is a development of the old Mimamori-kun, is adopted as standard, and various information support and easy grasp of vehicle condition are realized. In addition, by utilizing the vehicle data obtained by Mimamori in the advanced genuine maintenance system "Preism", we have established a system to back up the securing of vehicle utilization rate. While equipped with the above-mentioned new innovations and new mechanisms, the weight increase from the conventional model is suppressed. 24 December 2015: Added CNG vehicles. It is the first CNG vehicle in a heavy-duty truck and uses a 6UV1 engine. 11 April 2016: Full model change of tractor. A standard roof car with a short cab will be added, and the engine will continue to use 6WG1 and 6UZ1, but 6UZ1 will change the specifications of the turbocharger, increase the size of the intercooler and radiator, improve the efficiency of the EGR cooler, change the supply pump, new injector By adopting the above and the ultra-high pressure common rail, the torque has been increased and the fuel efficiency has been improved. In addition, a newly developed 7.8L 2-stage turbo 6NX1 engine has been added. 27 April 2017: Minor drivetrain changes. Conforms to 2016 emission regulations.
